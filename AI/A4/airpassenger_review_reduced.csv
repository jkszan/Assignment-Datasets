" London to Izmir via Istanbul. First time I'd flown TK. I found them very good in the air, cabin crew, planes, food, all very nice. Not so great on the ground, ground staff, call centre, computer systems. My flight from LHR was delayed so I missed the connection in Istanbul. Most ground staff don't speak English, and I was given contradictory instructions from those that could speak a little English. I eventually got on a flight to Izmir three hours later, but it wasn't an easy process, made worse by the vast distances one has to walk between gates in the cavernous new airport. Also, I'd phoned a TK call centre (based in Ukraine) to pay an extra Â£40 or so each way for extra leg room seats. However, as the departure times kept changing, my seats kept changing, and for the return leg to London from Istanbul I was not given an extra leg room seat. Luckily there was a spare exit row seat and the cabin crew sorted me out. Overall, I think their cabin crew and planes are very good, ground staff and call centre staff need better training and they all need better computer systems and software to work with.",Passive
" Istanbul to Bucharest. We make our check in in the airport, they Take our luggage , we go to the gate and at the gate surprise they dont let uÈ™ board with two children, because they say the flight is overbooked. We had to wait in the airport with two children until 5 oclock in the morning until they bring uÈ™ to a hotel 2 hours far away from the airport without luggage, without eat without nothing. Our first and last flight with this airline.",Detractor
" Rome to Prishtina via Istanbul. I flew with this company several times in the past years, and I can honestly say that it is getting worse and worse. I flew from Rome to Prishtina via Istanbul, all 4 flights had a delay (which apparently is pretty normal with Turkish). The ground staff is for the most part useless. In Istambul i have tried to ask a few information about a flight delay (i had just 30 minutes before the connecting flight) and the whole answer was: ""Relax Sir, No problem Sir, It's okay"". The new airport is a gigantic mess, very big and disorganized. When you land in Istanbul it takes about 20 to 25 minutes taxiing and other 10 minutes before they actually start disembarking, it's an exhausting experience especially if you are in a hurry. Forget about asking for some indication at the new airport, they all chat between each other, some with a coffee in their hands. I flew with four different aircraft on this trip, two were fairly new, the other two were old, seats worn. Food on board was of very poor quality.., let me repeat this, very...poor quality. In general i can say that crew is decently trained and deliver a good experience or at least they try, of course it is far from the experience you get flying Qatar or Emirates but still pretty good, while ground personnel, especially in Istanbul is the personification of the word Lazy. A complete disaster. I will try and avoid Turkish Airlines in the future, it is not a cheap company and definitely not worth for the money you pay. If you are in a hurry or you know you will be avoid this company and avoid the new istanbul airport at all costs.",Detractor
" Flew on Turkish Airlines IAD-IST-KHI and return KHI-IST-IAD. Turkish Airlines has consistently maintained its quality since I first flew with them in 2007. The flights leave on time, the catering is excellent, the inflight entertainment is extensive and the interface easy to use, and the cabin crew is excellent. Interesting though the A330 on the KHI-IST route and return seemed to have more leg room and was newer than the A330 on the IAD-IST route which was showing its age. The A330 on the IAD-IST route had a slow responding interface for the inflight entertainment and a broken table on the return flight. But Turkish Airlines will be replacing the A330 on its flight to IAD with the 787 sometime in the summer. Turkish food was served on the return leg which I personally like, and I saw the cabin staff helping elderly passengers walk to the lavatory which was nice. Overall another wonderful experience with Turkish Airlines.",Promoter
" Mumbai to Dublin via Istanbul. Never book Turkish airlines if you are traveling to Dublin from Mumbai. If the flight gets delay from Mumbai, they don't have any other options for you. They will straight forward ask you to stay in hotel in Istanbul. They do not care for any for your time loss. No decisions has been made from airlines crew within time. They kept me waiting for more than 3 hours.",Detractor
" Istanbul to Budapest via Dublin with Turkish Airlines. Delays on each flight for both legs of the journey - stuck in Istanbul for almost 20 hours with ground staff who were rude, slow or unhelpful and took an hour to get our bags. The only only thing positive I can say is that the food on the plane is good, everything else was disastrous.",Detractor
" Istanbul to Algiers, planned to take off at 9:30 pm and to arrive to Algiers at 11:20 pm same night. We got an announcement that the flight is delayed by 2:55 hours due to technical issue. Then after boarding around midnight, and after starting taxiing, the pilot announced that the issue is still there and we have to go back to the gate! Another delay announced! Furthermore, they did not allow the passengers to get off the plane! complete chaos since the passengers do not want to take this aircraft anymore (and I completely understand) and what worsen the situation is that neither the pilot nor any official came to us and explained what is going on. No explanation, no apology, nothing! they requested the police and we saw armed civilian men at the gate . We did not take off until 6:30 am (that's a total delay of more than 9 hours!) Due to this delay, I lost my full working day in Algiers on April 15 due to the resulting inconvenience and fatigue (I am a consultant and I had several meeting planned for that day). I will never take Turkish Airlines again.",Detractor
" Basel to Cape Town via Istanbul. When I arrived in Istanbul at 10pm we are informed that TK44 to Cape Town (departure at 1.55am) is delayed 4,5 hours. No reason for this Delay was announced. I received a voucher for Burger King, Sbarro Pizza or Popeys. The staff at the gate were very unfriendly.",Detractor
"  Abu Dhabi to Luxembourg via Istanbul. From AUH-IST, as the flight was at 1:30am, the flight was I comfortable due to the small size of the aircraft. The seats were cramped although the leg room was okay-ish. Service started mid way through and the food was okay but nothing great. Staff was mostly friendly. IST-LUX staff was friendlier, aircraft was bit better, the food was of the same standard though. I think it was a decent experience overall but I would prefer a more spacious air craft even if the flight is 4.5 hours from AUH.",Passive
" The experience with Turkish Airlines has been devastating one. First paid $200 Euros per luggage, totaling $400 Euros for 2 luggage that end up lost between Turkish Airlines and JetBlue. My itinerary was from Venice to Istanbul to Boston and from there with Jetblue to San Juan, Puerto Rico. Once I made it to Boston I looked for my luggage and it never made it to BOS. I immediately try to make a reclamation to Turkish Airlines at BOS and was told that I had to wait until my final destination. Once I made it to my final destination I made my claim. Turkish Airlines will not cooperate with Jetblue and even if JB was really trying to help is not much they could do because TATurkish Airlines did not care for my luggage. It never made to Boston. Turkish Airlines have been unhelpful. In my case, even presenting evidence to both airlines, neither is able to find my lost claim luggage. It seems the claim is a form which after being submitted it get to be submitted evidence, dead word, as they do not even comply with the search of the lost not delivered luggage in hands of Turkish Airlines.",Detractor
"  New York to Erbil via Istanbul. They have the worst customer service. My initial leg was delayed due to weather so I was going to miss my connection. Turkish Airlines did nothing to help - in fact finding someone with Turkish Airlines to assist is a feat in itself. TA kept passing the blame. Bottom line - if any segment of your Turkish Airlines flights causes a delay then you are SOL when it comes to TA. Plan on spending a lot more money and flying another airline because Turkish Airlines will not assist you and they will keep your money. The ""customer service"" is a joke - they read from scripts and keep repeating the same paragraph - almost like robots. They also tell you to send an email - it is just a stalling tactic.",Detractor
" Tehran to New York via Istanbul. Terrible experience and terrible customer service! Will never fly again. I tried to change my flight date, called the airline and they made the changes. Told me I would be getting a confirmation email after I hang up (Never received it). I called back, submitted my request again and was told that someone would get back to me in at most 7 days (Never happened again). I called back (this was 3 days to the actual flight date), was told I need to go to a Airline office to make a change!. The closest office to me is 250 miles away. Also, there was a schedule change on the ticket that I did not confirm. When I called, I was told that I would not get charged the penalty, I ended up getting charged+the fare difference (almost 500$). In addition to the trip cost (200$) for a one way trip. So this has never happened before with any other airline. It would have been easier to cancel and buy a new flight which would have cost me around $800 for a two way.",Detractor
" Belgrade to Athens via Istanbul. My first flight departed with delay from Belgrade due to local weather conditions in Istanbul. I requested for a connection assistance in order to catch my second flight but the airline did not provide me such assistance. I managed to arrive at the gate of departure of my second flight while boarding was not completed and while the screen mentioned 'last call' but I was denied boarding because 'the system had unchecked me from the second flight due to late arrival of my previous plane'. People were boarding in front of my eyes on the plane. The Turkish Airlines officer deceivingly told me to go to another gate (215) because another plane was waiting for me. He just got rid of me. Gate 215 was near the rebooking office of Turkish Airlines for the issuance of new tickets. Although I was condemned to stay overnight at the airport, I was not proposed hotel accommodation or a meal. I was put on another flight departing next morning without even offered the possibility to select my checked seat (the officer rejected my request for an aisle position despite the fact that the plane was half-empty!). I filled a complaint form for denial of boarding and they replied that they are not responsible for a flight delay due to weather conditions. Turkish Airlines maybe is a large company but it manages these type of routine problems poorly as a low budget airline.",Detractor
" Dublin to Tel Aviv via Ä°stanbul. First of all our flight was delayed for over an hour, but that's fine we crossed that bridge, then when we arrived in Ä°stanbul airport we were told that we missed our connection flight. Ridiculous considering the fact the tickets were bought from Turkish Airlines and not from different companies, ok, 10 minutes of talking to customer service and we got new tickets from Ä°stanbul to Tel Aviv (not same comfortable plane as it supposed to be but still something) Arriving in Tel Aviv we found our 3 bags on the belt but so called oversized bag (which was actually a doll birthday box for my daughter) was missing almost 2 hours waiting for it to be found (no luck) then another half an hour of registering with lost&found made us exhausted (myself my husband and 2 kids aged 3 and 5 at 5am in the morning is no fun at all) We supposed to pick up our rental car in between 3-4am and when we came to get it apparently the car was gone to another customer because we were late. We had no choice but get another more expensive car that was available (I think Turkish airlines should be liable for that as well) We registered lost baggage gave the address and phone number in Petah and asked them to deliver it there as we were going to Eilat for a few days. I was pretty much confident that should be no problem with contact details. I was 5 days later arriving back to Tel Aviv and with no contact from lost&found I rang them to see what's the story and I was shocked when I heard that my baggage was delivered to me the following day! Where? When? To who? The answer was simple we have in our system that you baggage left to Eilat next day and was delivered to the hotel so we are really sorry but you have to get it yourself from there! How come they left my baggage in the hotel without notifying me? Answer was: Delivery company rang you but there was no answer. Left a message? I doubt it I think it's pure lies) Anyway I said I want my baggage back please get it to me! Oh you know it might take couple of days. Fine I said just get it please! Few days later I rang again because nothing came and find out that delivery man came to the hotel in Eilat asked for me but because me and my spouse have different surnames he was told that there's no such person registered (but then the question is how could he leave it there if he was told the person is not there) Again I was promised that few days later I will get it. As you can imagine I didn't. Rang again today asked for the manager (was told the manager is in holiday) got to speak to supervisor and what a surprise she said that the baggage is not in the hotel in Eilat but in airport Eilat and because it's holiday (Pesah) the airport is closed and they can't get it. And she said you know it's your fault that it went to Eilat. When I asked her name she refused to give and hanged up on me.",Detractor
" Houston to Kiev via Istanbul. Fares seem competitive, but there is a catch in terms of layover time. Mine from Houston to Kiev Via Istanbul had a return leg layover of 14 hours and though TK website says that a layover of over a certain hours gets a complimentary hotel stay. But there is a fine print somewhere which they always get a disqualified citing some wired â€œrulesâ€ that I, even as a frequent traveler cannot comprehend. Another notable difference in Turkey is that there are endless and multiple security checks, and one wonders if one is going through a war zone . Lines at security checks and passport control ( yes, if you need to stay at a hotel for a long layover, one needs to get an e-VISA just to get out, check into a hotel and get back to airport to catch the connecting flight). Ended up paying way more than if I had chosen other airlines like LH or SAS, which I will keep in mind next time",Detractor
" Tashkent to Istanbul. A poor experience with Turkish Airlines. The guy who seemed to be the cabin chief was acting in a very extremely rude way towards the passengers, almost yelling at them, mostly hurrying people to sit down quickly. Very unprofessional. The tightest space for seating I experienced, apart from a low cost carrier in Indonesia. A mess with luggage, clearly too many volumes allowed onboard.",Detractor

 London Heathrow to Istanbul. The flight from LHR took off on time. Boarding was hassle free. Seating was 3x3x3. Legroom was average but I had an emergency exit row seat. Cabin service was average with not many smiles. The flight was smooth as was the landing.,Passive
 Istanbul to Trabzon. Boarding was fast. I thought flight will be on time but no! Taxi took forever. We've waited 40 minutes to take-off. Don't remember if I've heard any explanation from cabin crew. I'd prefer 60 minutes at airport to 40 minutes at a plane seat. Cabin crew was good. Sandwich and drink giveaway was nice. Cheap price.,Passive
" Izmir to Istanbul. It was my first Boeing 777 experience. They gave a free hot sandwich with cheese and vegetables and a drink. Hot and cold options were rich. Cold ones weren't very cold but you can add some ice to them. Plane was really big and crowded yet there were no problem with fresh air and air conditioning. Well, maybe one. One of the cabins leaked some water to a passenger. They suddenly suggested he change his seat, he refused. Flight on time, good cabin crew. And this time, it was extremely cheap.",Promoter
 New Delhi to Cappadocia via Istanbul. I took a flight from New Delhi 6:15pm on 16th April it got delayed by 1.5hours and flew at 7:50pm. I had a connecting flight at 12:20pm on 16th April to Cappadocia from Istanbul but as I reached late due to delay from this airline I missed my flight. They gave me a flight for 11:30 pm without providing any hotel accommodations. Later I had to force them to give me a earlier flight as I was tired so they gave me a flight for 8:35pm TK 2018 which also was delayed and the flight departed at 10:50pm. I some how was happy that at least I reached Cappadocia but my whole day and hotel booking was wasted. I went to pick my luggage but as to my surprise my luggage did not arrive and I was told it's arriving in the next flight and they shall have it sent to my hotel. I came to my hotel and not it's about 4pm on 17th April and my luggage has still not arrived even after making several calls. This airline has charged me a lot without giving any good service or facility. I would highly recommend not to book Turkish Airlines ever to any one unless they want to waste their time and money. Don't know when will my luggage arrive and till when I have to sit in my hotel and waste time as I cannot freshen up unless I get my clothes and got out to see this city.,Detractor
"  Singapore to Zagreb via Istanbul. Customer service at Istanbul Airport is horrible. I miss my connecting flight upon arriving in Istanbul from Singapore. I have ask the flight attendants onboard regarding my connecting flight. She assure me that I have no problem doing the connection. Upon arrival, there was no staff to assist. My flight was not showing on the display. I end up going to their care point counter. The staff there is the worst. I would give the rating negative 1. They just took their time to figure out your next flight. If I have not insisted that I need to fly on the same day, they just put me on the next day flight. This is the worst terminal service I come across in my 10 years of travel.",Detractor
" Baku to Amsterdam via Istanbul. They still operate like a third world airline. Check in counter staff at the new airport was ignorant (when she finished my check in, she just left the boarding pass and my passport on the counter instead of handing them to me).

She just made that up.",Detractor
"  New York JFK to Tel Aviv via Istanbul. Do not fly Turkish Airlines! We had round trip scheduled March-April 2019. Just before leaving on our trip they cancelled the second leg of our return flight and placed us on another flight which involved a 14 hour layover in Istanbul airport. Then, upon arrival in Istanbul on our way out to Tel Aviv they cancelled the second leg of this part of the trip as we stood at the gate waiting for departure and put us on another flight several hours later because the later flight was not full. Imagine 300 People at an airline gate waiting as staff filled out new boarding passes for everyone by hand!. We cancelled our return arrangements (without refund) and flew another airline home at the end of our vacation. Rather lose the money then deal with this airline any further!",Detractor
" Kathmandu to Berlin via Istanbul. Their service is worst because they usually overbook the flight and it was like first come first serve basis and airport staff don't even listen the customer request. They treat people like they are doing favor to them. Flight often delayed by 2- 4 hours and they don't care about your connecting flight.

" Atlanta to Amman via Istanbul. Beside being one of the filthiest airport bathrooms and cheap of course for not making it easy to use the Wi-Fi, they make us wait 5 more hours in the transit just because they can fill up the plane by merging another plane for people who are going to Amman without giving us any notice!

" Lagos to Istanbul via Kathmandu. I am never flying with Turkish Airlines again and I won't recommend to anyone I know, my friends or families. I had a very long layover both the ways around (20hrs) each. I had heard from many friends that Turkish would give a hotel or other relevant services if we have to wait there above specific hours.

To my surprise, the lady on the desk took my all information from passport and ticket and said you cannot get a hotel. Then I asked why",Detractor
"  Mumbai to Istanbul. One of the worst experiences of our life has been this trip on Turkish Airlines. After booking a confirmed flight on 6th April we were offered one in which the connecting flight leaves 2 days earlier than we land. Thankfully we didn't select this by mistake. Then we were given a new itinerary which needed us staying overnight at Istanbul. We were then given a hotel room outside the airport which needed us to spend 220 USD on an express visa to enter Turkey plus an additional 100 USD on travel. The airline doesn't give you rooms in the airport, which turns out to be more expensive for the passenger as there is no proper public transport to our hotel room and Turkish won't pay for it. To make matters worse today the check in doesn't work and they've told us we need to reach early to the airport if we need good seats. Avoid this airline for its terrible customer service.",Detractor

" Amsterdam to Bangkok via Istanbul. I wont book again after the conditions I flew in. Food: tasty. Over the average for an airline. In-flight entertainment: large variety of movies. Cabin crew: negligent and sloppy, to a frustrating level. So many episodes where they disregarded very simple requests from passengers or (worse) caused problems due to their disorganization. Gate crew: at the check-in I chose a spot that would allow me to easily access the bathroom, that I need for medical reasons. At the gate the seat got striked through and I have been re-assigned, no explanations provided. When I asked for the seat to be changed to an aisle seat, I have been told by the cabin crew to temporarily sit on the assigned seat. After take-off, my request got ignored for the whole flight, regardless many seats were empty. Seats extremely unconfortable and impossible to sleep in (very old plane for a 10h flight). Mine was even broken so I could not sleep at all. Food service: chaotic to the point that some people started to serve themselves due to the fact that their requests were disregarded or forgotten. Overall a very bad experience that leaves me confused at how this company won any awards. At first I also gave it the benefit of the doubt that's why I waited to write the review but the return flight confirmed all the negligent behaviors I saw on the departure flight. Other airlines offer very similar prices and the cons don't make up for the flight conditions you will experience.",Detractor
" Venice to Ankara via Istanbul. Instead of taking off on time the fight was originally delayed (on the information table was written 10 minutes). I was satisfied with the information (it is possible to be delayed). The next information which followed invited us to go to the gate. More than 75% of passengers created the line in front of the desk and we were waiting for opening the gate. It was the first mistake, after 45 minutes the staff changed the departure time on the information desk for 10.50 a.m. Nobody knew that the game was started. The plane was delayed by more than 60 minutes. It is usually that the staff will give you any additional information about the connection flights. Unfortunately, it is not the case of Turkish Airlines . After the arrival, I run from the plane through the tunnel in the terminal and hoped to catch the flight to Ankara. The guy who was wearing the TA uniform and who was waiting at the end of the tunnel showed me the direction where I should have found the gate of for my flight. Of course, it was the wrong direction and I had to run back. After that, I had to go through the x-ray frame and I have lost another 10 minutes although I didn't leave the secured area. When I came into the main hall I sew that the gate is closed. Until this moment nobody has apologized for the inconvenience and to this day too. This horror trip was still not at the end. I tried to find the TA office and I found only the TA desk where was it possible to buy new tickets. When I started to explain my situation and the guy behind the desk recognised that I am not a new potential customer his face expression changed rapidly and his bored voice said to me that he is not responsible for information. The problem was closed for him. After a few minutes, I found the desk with the logo TA in the check-in sections. I run there to solve the problem and I tried to inform the first staff about my situation. His answer was: ""Wait a minute"".. I didn't want to wait and I said to him, that his company is responsible for the situation and I expect more empathy and full service for customers. No answer, only disgusted reaction visible in his mimic and he showed me with the finger another TA worker sitting next to him. This person let explain to him my situation again and he printed a new boarding pass for the flight at 6.00 p.m. I checked the departure on the screen and by my next flight was additional information that it is delayed 40 minutes before the departure. I asked the guy again whether it is mean serious and my second question was why it is not possible to get the ticket for the flight at 5.00 p.m.? The answer was given with the highest arrogance in his voice.""The flight is full!"". And it is still not the end of the troubles, instead of being delayed 40 minutes the ""great"" TA let me wait one hour longer in comparison with original departure schedule. The service was the mess and the behaviour of the employees was everything but not professional.",Detractor

" Flew TK 5 / 22 MAR, Istanbul - Chicago in business class. Had requested AVML (Asian vegetarian Meal). TK had forgotten my special AVML meal. On board they served boiled eggplant, tomato sauce and disgusting rice as THE main course. I refused to eat and returned my plate. No alternative food offered. I spoke to the cabin chief who expressed she was sorry and agreed that the meal served was not even close to AVML. Spoke to the chef on board who had no clue what AVML looks like. Starved for 12 hour flight. Cabin chief and the chef promised they would report this incident but it seems it did not go anywhere. I am an Elite Plus member of Turkish Airlines and it seems they do not care about their premium cabin passengers. Surprisingly cabin chief is TK's employee and the chef are employed by DO & CO catering company who provided meals for TK's passengers. Complained about the incident and response I got was we regret and no compensations given. It will be hard to choose TK for future travel.",Detractor
" I bought and paid tickets 3 months before departure. I had pre-selected certain seats convenient to us. I am a self-moving disabled person. I have no leg, I move on a prosthesis. The choice of a comfortable place is important for my sick leg. When I flying from Hurghada â€“ at the reception manager not given our pre-selected seats. He give to me uncomfortable seats in the tail of the aircraft, although I chose a seats for 4 months before departure. Turkish Airlines does not have Internet check-in when passengers departing from Hurghada. At the check-in Desk, the Manager issues boarding passes at random, not paying attention to the pre-selected seats in our tickets. 2. Indifference flight attendants In the plane, I ask for 2 flight attendants and explained the essence of the problem, said about my disability, showed my ticket. The flight attendants answered me: â€œThe plane is full. I can't help you, sorryâ€ The flight attendants were absolutely indifferent to my problems, they did not want to help me. 3. Stuff indifference at Ataturk Airport. Upon arrival in Istanbul, I had a connection time at the airport: 3: 20 - with our next flight to Vnukovo, Moscow. I was very tired, I had a pain in my leg, and I turned to the Info desk to ask the managers to let me rest for a short time in the lounges of Turkish Airlines. I said that I was disabled, I asked for help. In response, I received complete indifference, unwillingness to help me. The manager refused me any help, despite my repeated requests for help. I have not seen anywhere such a bad attitude, indifference to the disabled person in my air travels! 3. Problem with pre-ordered special meals When I buying tickets, my wife and I ordered Bland meal (BLML) and Diabetic meal (DBML) We always order in flights these types of food for our medical reasons. In all the airlines that we flew this food is much better than the standard meal. But in the case of Turkish Airlines, our special meal was simply inedible. This special meal given to us looked much worse than the standard nutrition. We just could not eat anything and flew hungry all our flights â€“ in two ways! I remember that in my meal there was a lot of fiber, which I cannot eat. This is incompatible with the concept of the Bland meal (BLML) diet.",Detractor
 Amsterdam to Bangkok via Istanbul. Flight boarded four hours late with no communication during this delay. Boarding was a complete shambles with everybody scrambling to get on.

" Dhaka to Copenhagen via Istanbul. This trip was full of disappointments. Already the airport lounge, Dhaka, demanded money for a glass of wine, unheard. I am a frequent flyer, I have never experienced business class lounge charging a business class passenger, for a glass of wine. Next, on board, no welcome drinks. I asked for a newspaper and a drink, the choice was a glass of water or a lemonade. After take-off, no beverage and snacks, just the meal, which was disgusting. My choice was beef, which was cold, dry, served with some bean and carrots, also cold. I asked for a glass of red wine, but waiting and waiting, I tried to draw the attention of a crew, who was talking with another passenger in the front row. Then I had to get up went where he was enjoying a conversation with the passenger. I made my request- I got served a glass of wine-. I expressed my gratitude- and the crew explained the delay- he had to take care of a CIP. The meal was eatabel, so asked for a cup of coffee and a glass of cognac. Surprise- the crew said there was no cognac. I showed the menu, which showed cognac was available. Well, had almost 6hours layover at Istanbul airport lounge, which was OK. About 90 minutes prior to board, we were asked to go the the gate. After completion of checking tickets and passports, we were waiting to board- almost 45 minutes had to wait and then bus to the plain. The flight was on way to Copenhagen. There were a grpoup of Danish passengers,. A elderly gentleman asked for lass of cognac, the crew was about to serve a generous glass of cognac. Another female crew rushed and snatched the glass, poured half of the content to another glass and then served the guest. We had a laugh- that was entertaining.- but not convincing for making Turkish Airline the choice any more.",Detractor
" Hanoi to Milano via Istanbul. As we 4 arrived this morning from Hanoi at 6 am (TK168) we learned that our connecting flight to Milan TK1873 had been cancelled. No assistance was given to passengers, everybody had to wander around the immense airport, address the numerous TK people behind desks each of whom seemed to take care of anything but customer service and only care to dispatch people somewhere else. Finally we got to the right desk and were given the TK flight leaving at 16.15, 10 hours waiting time. We were assured this was the first possibility open. To our surprise we discovered that there is a previous flight leaving at 12.45 with seats available. Hundreds of people crowded at the desk with only 2 employees working so we gave up trying to anticipate our flight, and no contact was possible on the phone.",Detractor
 Manila to Vienna via Istanbul. Seats are comfortable. In-flight media selection is great and updated. Food is good. Paid in-flight Wifi (MNL-IST) is excellent for long-haul flights. No Wifi for IST-VIE. Cabin crew not friendly but not bad either. Boarding can be quite delayed. Gate announcements are delayed (sometimes changed at the last minute) - be careful! You might miss your flight especially if you have a hard time finding gates.,Promoter
"  Boarding totally chaotic and far too long. Nice meal, creepy safety video which distracted the people more than giving them advice. Crew notifications (strong turkish accent, sound quality) hardly understandable, even for native speakers. Economy legroom and seat width did not at all suit the flight duration on the first flight from Phuket to Istanbul (11 hours), more equal to short-distance low costers. (disclaimer: I had a seat at an emergency exit, luckily). WiFi did not work for me and others at all, for some more expensive devices it did, but very slowly (asked my neighbours and staff for help, but no way to get it working). Very expensive seat pre-selection (160+30â‚¬ for a 400â‚¬ flight), so I did not take it and was lucky at the airport check-in.",Detractor
" Istanbul to Amsterdam. Although a bit worn and older than A330-300, the economy cabin of A330-200 is more comfortable than 333's. This flight had a good seat pitch for a short haul flight. Ground service was smooth and cabin crew was one of the best I have seen at Turkish. Since the second choice of meal was out, we were offered more complimentary drinks. The only setback in this flight was the old, an outdated-interfaced IFE with a limited selection. After a few years of slight disappointments, I am happy to include Turkish Airlines into my highly preferred airlines once again.",Promoter

" If you fly economy with an A330-300 of Turkish Airlines, be prepared for a problematic seat pitch. I just could not became friends with the seatings of the majority of wide-body planes of Turkish. Other than that, this was a pleasant flight. Ground service was smooth and friendly - this was a good surprise. Cabin crew may use a little more smiles on their faces but did not experience any major problem on that side. IFE selection and quality is vigorous, one of the best you can encounter anywhere. Meal and drinks are good as always - an above average Chardonnay was a joyful accompany. Thumbs up.",Promoter

 This was my first time using Turkish Airlines and I was satisfied. Check in at Lyon airport was fine. The flight was full but I managed to find space for my carry on bags. The flight left a bit late. The cabin on board was in good condition and seem to be new. The crew and the service was good. The inflight entertaiment is excellent with a big screen for each sea and a great selection of different type of movies. The meal was tasty and there was a good selection of any type of drinks. The flight went fine but it took more time to land in Ataturk airport because of weather in Istanbul. Turkish airlines is an excellent airline and operates probably to the most countries in the world. I would defently fly again with them if I have a chance,Promoter
" Dublin to Manila via Istanbul. This flight was both a disaster and a nightmare. This incident happened during Istanbul-Manila leg of my flight. Im not sure what happened, but I your ground crew was disorderly and very unwelcoming. The boarding was horrible, flying business is not worth it especially I am queueing with the rest of the passengers. The on board experience was the tipping point. Since last year, I never had problem with my Vegan meal onboard as I make sure to preselect them online. But this flight was a disaster. Not only I made only preselection, I wrote to the menu that I am vegan, and the chef was aware i dont eat cheese as he asked me before flight. When I was served with appetizers, I was curious as they gave me a butter on a small dish. At first, I though it could be vegan as I was given butter previously, but that was on a pack, not this time. I called the head steward and explain my conundrum. The chef came and explained and apologized. They insisted i ordered vegetarian as shown on their records, but I showed my confirmation email that I did preselect Vegan meal. Somewhere something went wrong. I settled for orange juice, and went to sleep. Before landing, the chef gave me a minimal but unbusiness like food. I still appreciate his effort to come up with vegan food.",Detractor

I was traveling for a conference and unfortunately missed a connection flight after last minute gate change. I was sent around their customer desks without any help. I was finally told I needed to pay extra to change my ticket, an amount that was far more than the original cost of the return ticket. They said the best they could do was to help me call my family. I was left stranded at Istanbul Airport. I had to request a friend to pay for a ticket from a different airline to get to my conference destination. After the conference I went back to the airport hoping to utilize my return ticket with Turkish Airlines, only to be told that it is no invalid and I have to book a flight afresh. I struggled to raise money and finally was able to buy a ticket with different flight and go home.",Detractor
" I along with my 6.5-month-old son were traveling from London to Kabul via Istanbul. The flight from London got delayed. When I arrived at Istanbul I couldn't find my son's pushchair which was supposed to be next to the aircraft. I had to jump on the bus to get to the next flight but when I arrived that was gone. I was only booked on the next flight leaving 24 hours later. I was not offered any accommodation or any facilities to help me care for my baby. Even the pushchair was not brought to me so at least the little one could sleep. In the past when I had traveled with them with my husband for much shorter stays we would be offered free food and drinks but didn't receive that as well. Because I was a woman with a small child and couldn't argue with them because my son was crying all the time, they just made sure I don't get any help, while I should have been offered more given the circumstances. In light of all this, my son and I suffered very much and it wasn't even our fault. Please avoid this airline they are the worst people to fly with. They pick on people who are more vulnerable and in need. I will never ever fly with this airline again. My problem is not with the delays, delays are part of traveling but when the airline gets it wrong they should have the moral standards to look after their customers especially when its a mother and a child. They should have the mindset as to how to do more, but as I explained above their attitude was how to give less and cheat a mother and a little child.",Detractor

" Never again will I use Turkish Airlines. We booked the ticket to Cape Town from Malaga (via Istanbul) 6 months in advance and chose Turkish due to the more direct route than having to travel to UK/Northern Europe or Middle East. We paid for extra legroom seats on all flights. One hour before leaving for the airport on our outbound date I received a phone call from the Turkish Airlines ticket desk at Malaga Airport to advise that the Istanbul-Malaga (second leg) of our return journey flight had been cancelled. They told us to go to the ticket desk when we arrived and before we checked in to be given options. The options were an 8 hour wait in Istanbul airport for the next flight (no thank you after an 11 hour flight) or the same flights a day later. We opted for the second option of flying on our original flight choices day later. The lady on the desk suggested that we claim afterwards for the extra hotel night and the extra day car hire. She also said that she could not book us the seats we had already paid for and that we should try to ticket desk in cape Town to do this for us. We checked in, we started to board, they got us all on to the air bridge where we stayed for about an hour before being moved back into the terminal. Then we boarded. The flight departed 90 minutes late with no explanation. The staff said that they did not know what the problem was. We arrived in Istanbul with a short connection due to the delay and after being bussed from the plane to the terminal we ran like crazy to get on the flight. We made it but our luggage remained in Istanbul. One case arrived a day later & the second case 2 days later. We collected the first case ourselves (as we thought they were both there) and went to the ticket desk to arrange the seats for the return journey. We had to leave all of our details with them as they were busy and unable to attend to it at the time. I e:mailed the ticket desk and customer services a number of times and each time the mails were returned with a message saying that the inboxes were full and could not accept any further mails. I also made a few phone calls but never managed to get an answer. After about a week I received a call from the ticket desk with an offer of slightly different but acceptable seats. When I told her about the issues I had ben having regarding contacting them she told me that the sales desk were very short staffed and that there actually isnt a customer service unit at all in Cape Town. During this time we were travelling with friends around the Cape and at times were without internet so communications were difficult. I also began the process of trying to claim for the emergency clothing items that we had to buy. I am still trying to complete the electronic form which keeps saying that I am giving wrong information (it doesnt specify what it doesnt like) and I am simply completing each box in order as it request me to do - along with the uploading of the files they request. I have tried to complete this form numerous times and in the beginning with help from the baggage handling company who confirmed that I was completing the form correctly. To this day I am still in communication with Turkish Airlines requesting them to reimburse me. They have refused to reimburse us with the cost of the hotel & car rental and are fobbing me off regarding the clothing cost. I know that I am legally entitled to this so I will continue to press.",Detractor
" Dubai to Lisbon via Istanbul. In April, I booked a flight from Dubai to Lisbon for $530.90 with Turkish Airlines. When I received an email to check-in, I was unable to do so. I decided to call them to inquire why. They told me they cancelled my reservation and my credit card was flagged as fraud. I was told to provide proof that the credit card belonged to me so I did. First of all, why was I not notified that they cancelled my reservation? I even received an email notification to remind me to check-inâ€¦ After a long day of correspondence, they emailed me saying I can get the flight for the same price that I originally paid. I called to book my flight and they said it wasn't going through again so I had to use a different credit card. The Turkish Airlines representative then confirmed my payment went through and checked me in online. Great! I finally have a reservation since it was less than 7 hours till departure. When I went to drop off my bag at the Dubai airport, the Turkish Airlines representative said that there was no reservation for me. I showed him my confirmation AND showed him my online credit card statement that showed I had a charge from Turkish Airlines. He repeatedly told me I no longer have a reservation and need to buy a new ticket with a travel agency at the airport. He also told me I would be fully refunded when I submit a claim with Turkish Airlines. Again, why wasn't I notified that they cancelled my reservation? Why did they cancel my reservation after they already charged my credit card? It was 1 hour until departure so I did exactly what the Turkish Airlines representative told me to do. I bought a ONE WAY flight for $1306.98!! Since my flight in April, I've had a nonstop battle trying to get my refund. On Dec 19, 2018, Turkish Airlines called me to apologize for everything that's happened. She admitted it Turkish Airlines' fault and that they didn't follow their protocol which resulted in them cancelling my reservation. She asked me to send a copy of my passport and my credit card statements and that I would get my full refund in one week. Since that phone call, Turkish Airlines has completely ignored me. I've tried contacting them Jan 4, Jan 6, Jan 9, Jan 15, Jan 16, Jan 20, Jan 22, Jan 25, Jan 29, Feb 1, Feb 4, Feb 14, and Feb 20. Every time I've tried contacting them, they either do not respond to me or the call center tells me they'll mark my case as urgent and someone will respond to me in 48 hours. I have not ONCE heard back from them ever since I was told I would get fully refunded in Dec. Why is their protocol to respond within 7 days or 48 hours, but it's been 2 months now and I haven't heard from them yet? Why did they not follow the proper protocol in the very beginning when I booked my flight? Why didn't they ever notify me that they cancelled my reservation? Why did their own employee confirm my payment went through and check me in? Why did they cancel my reservation when they already charged me? Why did their own employees tell me that they'll fully refund me, but aren't now? Why are they completely ignoring me? I feel like everyone should be aware how horrible Turkish Airlines is. I hope no one else has to go through what I've been through. It's been seriously affecting my health dealing with them. It's evident that they have horrible service and will not refund people (reading other reviews). Please- save your money, time, and health, and book a different airline.",Detractor
" Montreal to Berlin via Istanbul. I was mostly disappointed with the services. I flew from Montreal to Istanbul and from the beginning I felt the experience to be flawed. There were some 28 business class seats and I had chosen a seat with direct aisle access. The seat is quite comfortable and large was what I noticed at first. The cabin crew was awful. They congregated at the forward cabin near the bar and watched us settle in. As we were in the middle of winter, passengers all had heavy winter coats. I was seated in row two and could overhear some passengers asking the crew if they could take their coats. I was a bit taken aback by the crews response: ""No, later, later"". Needless to say, I was not going to go out of my way to ask them to take my coat and instead opted to leave it at my seat. The crew members did not offer to take my coat nor my neighbour's at any time during this 9,30 hour flight. We sat in the cabin at our seats with no drinks offered, no water bottle for at least 15 minutes. The crew came by after 15 minutes to offer us a selection of non alcoholic beverages. I declined the drink and was asked if I wanted anything else and I ordered champagne. All drinks during our entire flight were served with no napkin and I thought this to be a bit odd since you get a napkin in Canada even on low cost carriers! Menus were handed out and we were asked for our selection later on. After take off, the service was not well planned. It took a while before any crew member came by and when they did they offered to make our beds! We had just left Montreal at 1045 pm and I suspect this is why they were asking us prior to even taking a drink order! I declined the offer for bedding and informed they that I would be ready for it after dinner. ""Of Course Sir, anything you want"". The response lacked being genuine and I felt the crew was somewhat irked. The service began with handling out a bottle of water, 40 minutes into the flight. We waited another 10 or so minutes and we were asked for drinks. The ""Onboard Chef"" came by to take our food order and this was also done in a chaotic way. He would take the order for 3-5 seats at a time and then disappear. The whole order taking for the entire business class must have taken 40 minutes. The food was served and it was beautifully plated. I can't say the food tasted better than any other overseas carrier I've flown in business class. The onboard chef seemed like it was all a show and I could not really see how he was a chef. He took our order (chefs don't usually do this) and made sure the plates looked nice. I think that is the extent of it and I don't really see any exotic or added value to this.During the whole meal, my drinks went dry for 10 or more minutes at a time. I have flown many carriers in business class and I have never had to ask or get up to ask for more wine with my meal. The crew in the business cabin were simply not friendly nor attentive. I also experienced the Turkish Airlines lounge in Istanbul during my connection. It is tired looking and circus like atmosphere. I qualified for the use of a resting suite. The attendant informed me she would come by to let me know when I could shower. I was there 3 hours, and she never came.",Detractor
" New York to Dhaka via Istanbul. Services at Istanbul Airport was horrible and totally unprofessional. I had a flight from JFK to Istanbul on the way to Dhaka and had a 12-hour long stay over in Istanbul. While it was written on the Turkish website that they would give a hotel room if the stay over is 12 hours or more, there was no such opportunity. Turkish airlines staff at the airport had limited English proficiency, lack of decency (rude), and lower motivation to cooperate. However, instead of a hotel room, a lady at the counter offered me snacks. When I requested for lunch instead of snacks or breakfast, the lady just tore the check she wrote in front of me. I was devastated seeing this non-professional rudeness. Only positive things were inflight hospitality and foods.",Detractor
" In 9/30/2018 my wife, our 11 months old son, and myself took Turkish Airlines to fly from San Francisco to Addis Ababa via Istanbul. Half way in the first leg of the flight (from San Francisco to Istanbul), a lady in the flight got sick and a decision was made to divert the plane to Bergen Norway, so the lady can get a medical treatment.  This caused 3 hours delay on our arrival time to Istanbul and we missed our second leg flight (From Istanbul to Addis) as a result. When we first got to Istanbul information was scarce and no one were willing to help. After a lot of leg work we finally reached to the â€œTransferâ€ station where we can request to be booked to another flight.  We were told the next flight to Addis Ababa is 24 hours later and the airline will provide hotel accommodations for us. They booked us to the next flight and refer us to another station where we can request hotel accommodation. When we got to the hotel accommodation station, we were told to get a visa and return. When we got to the Visa station we faced discrimination because my wife carried a passport from Ethiopia. Visa was offered to my son and myself who were carrying a US passport and denied to my wife who were carrying Ethiopian passport. When we asked why we were told they don't give Visas to people who carry Ethiopian passport. We showed them my wife's US green card and explain the situation we will face if we had to stay in the airport with a sick child for 24 additional hours and they still refuse to give my wife a visa. The only solution they offered is to leave my wife who was breastfeeding behind.  We tried to call the US Embassy in Istanbul to explain the situation, but they were closed for the day. Out of options, hungry and tired, we finally decide to stay in the airport for the next 24 hours. We returned to Turkish airlines terminal and asked if we get admittance to the Turkish airline lounge, so our child can rest in a comfortable area and this request was denied because we are not Turkish airline business customers. For the next 24 hours, we were prisoners in Istanbul airport. I regret my decision to fly Turkish and I will never fly them again.",Detractor
" My first time on Turkish. It's not a bare-basics, race-to-the-bottom product, but it's far behind Asian carriers and Qatar Airways in warmth and sophistication. There is a lot of confusion both in the cockpit and at the Istanbul transit area. Passengers are given the wrong information. My flight ex-KUL taxied all over the airport for 2 hours before returning to gate for refuelling. (We were just about to take off on a 11.5-hour journey with not enough fuel? Interesting.) That just about put paid to everyone's plans to catch their connecting flights. The gate number for my Geneva flight was different from what the entertainment system showed us right before landing (as I found out after sprinting, laptop and shoes in hand, to the wrong gate). Very stressful. On board, food is okay but same-same across sectors. English is not great unless pre-recorded. Male crew are quite patient and hard-working. The female staff can be pleasant when they want to be. Sadly, many make it very clear that having seen the world and having put peroxide highlights in their hair, pouring coffee in economy class is not where they want tp be. (How hard is it to say ""Good evening"" to a passenger during boarding, instead of giving an icy, silent stare?) In the future, unless I decide to travel to one of the secondary destinations served by TK, such as Salzburg or Lyon, my preference will remain with the more established airlines.",Passive

"  Vienna to Istanbul. Our morning flight was delayed then eventually cancelled due to the bad weather which is understandable. We had to rushed back to counter for them to issue another boarding pass and during this time it was already chaotic. Then they gave us options whather to take the next earliest flight but will arrive in Istanbul Sabiha airport and not Istanbul Ataturk airport. Another option is to take another flight but had to wait for another 9 hours. We took the first option because Turkish airlines promise that our luggage will be sent to Sabiha airport when we landed. Once landed, waited for around 45 mins - 1 hour for our luggage but none arrived including others that took the same option as ours. Few minutes later one of the staff came and informed us that all the luggage are left in Vienna. This became even more chaotic as passengers have other arrangements and obviously requires the luggage. The staff told us to file baggage lost at the counter and the queue itself took almost 2 hours. Turkish Airlines again made another promise that they would send it by the next morning to our hotel but again we still have not receive our luggage the next morning. Fortunately our hotel staff helped us to follow up on this matter and again Turkish Airlines made another promise that the luggage will be sent tomorrow evening. So day 3 In Istanbul with recycled sweaty clothes and no luggage. We are really hopeful that it will be sent by tomorrow evening as we are going back in few days.

 Istanbul to London. On our flight back from Istanbul we handed our baby stroller to Turkish Airlines. When we arrived to London we realized that the stroller was damaged. We started a claim case there at Heathrow airport. An online account was opened for us through which we filled in more information and received an evaluation which said that that THY would compensate the repair. We ordered two pieces of replacement covers and sent the receipts to THY. This was on the 19th of January. Since then we've been trying to resolve the case but we are being ignored. Today I talked to customer service for the 5th time. Every time I'm told that we should hear back in couple days but we never do. This is such a shame. What we claim is not even that much. If we were this responsive when we owed any money to THY we would be fined multiple times. They are getting away with it. It's such a shame for a company which claims to be world class.

" I am flying from Vienna to Singapore with a layover in Istanbul for 11 hours. I selected this long layover knowing that I had much shorter routes with the only intention of taking the Sunday 4:00 pm free tour around the city that Turkish Airlines provides to itÂ´s travelers when they have long wait at the airport. Prior my flight, I confirmed via phone with Turkish Airlines that there was no need to make a reservation and that as long as 1 person would like to make the tour, that would be sufficient to do it and that I needed to be at hotel desk 30 min before the start. As soon as we landed I rushed to the desk office but the passport control took about 50 minutes and I arrived at the desk at 3:50 pm (20 min later than expected). Although I was late, I did see that the tour group was there with the guide, getting ready to leave. I asked at the desk if I could join and they told me ""No, tour is finished"". I was not going to take no for an answer as I had chosen Turkish Airlines and a 11 hours layover flight (instead of 3) to jump on that tour. The manager approached me in a very rude way and told me that she had to leave and that the buses were full. She said that she could put me in the tour but that there was no space for me (in the website clearly states that as long as 1 person will be interested in the tour, it will be arranged). According to her excuse, she had 62 people ready to go and that was exactly the maximum amount that she could take. It is interesting, to say the least, that apparently I was so unlucky that I was the only person that was left out out of an exact number of 62 people. It is really hard to believe that the group of tourist standing next to me at that same moment was 62, when it looked more like 20 people. This person was extremely rude and zero customer oriented and did nothing to help me in that situation or to find an alternative. All she did was to yell at me and say that if I was not happy that I should open a claim (so that's what I'm doing now). I would like to highlight that all I wanted was to do the tour on my way to Singapore and it would have been really easy for her to make it happen. Instead, now I want a compensation.",Detractor
" Seychelles to Birmingham via Istanbul. Absolute joke of an airline. Booked a last minute ticket to get back to the UK for a family emergency, currently sat grounded on the tarmac at Istanbul with a small baby- it's been 2 hours and they claim it'll be another hour at least and just receiving a long list of stupid excuses and then no reason at all for another hours' delay with the most recent update.

When I got to the departure lounge, it was a 30 minute wait to pass immigration officials and to have my passport checked, A number of families moving to the UK slowed down the process. Pre Boarding failed at the families on hand did not understand English or Turkish languages. Boarding on to a new B737 was quick and excess cabin bags was controlled strictly at the gate. The cabin was very new, with a light and bright feel. The seat where average economy seats with reasonable leg room. The plane featured over head TV screens that showed a cheesy lego based pre flight video. The cabin crew was very good and offered an efficient service. Drinks where served after takeoff and a very Turkish meal was served an hour later, featuring rice, vegetables and kebab meat. A vegetarian option was available that looked like couscous. Drinks included fruit juice, sodas, beer and white wine. Inflight entertainment was limited to music and radio on 8 channels. Overall it was a pleasant flight and the seats where OK.",Passive

" Tashkent to Istanbul. Check in Tashkent was chaos, People where checking in box's of eggs and fresh produce to sell in Istanbul. I quickly slipped into the business line and saved 20 minutes from the check in process. When we all assembled in the depart lounge the pre boarding sequence went out of the window. People standing closest to the door where on 1st. This ruffled a few business travellers big time. The airplane was a well used and tired aircraft, the interior was well used & featured cramped and un comfortable economy seats. Boarding was swift and the crew did a manual safety briefing, before a quick take off. The inflight services was a limited range of drinks and tea. The meal options where greasy riced based meals with donner meats. There was no flight entertainment. The flight was over soon enough and we disembarked on a jet way with easy connection to my next flight.",Passive
" Istanbul to Tashkent. Got to the departure longue to find utter chaos, 100s of local people trying to board a flight, each carrying with 3 or 4 cabins bags, wedding dresses, quilts and electrical goods. The Turkish airlines staff did their best to bring control and remove bags from shopping happy Uzbeks. The boarding sequence did not work either. Reminds me of a rugby scrum at its best. We were bussed out to a well used aircraft with a very dated cabin. When I got to my window seat I found both seats full of stacked bags. Which had to be removed to the frustration of their owner. Turkish Airlines had an extra 6 or 7 staff on the flight trying to move what seemed 2 tonnes of bags into the hold and to sit people in there assigned seats. The flight had a delayed takeoff, which gave you time to look at a very tired interior, seats were old and lacked support. Leg room was zero and there was no IFE or video screens. The crew gave a manual safety demo and had to control people who wanted to change seats. The flight itself was OK, there was a basic drinks service and a simple meal of kebab meat and rice, there was no vegetation options that I could see off. The crew enforced a strict liquor policy from take off which worked well. Landing was OK and we where loaded into a bus from a remote parking space. Transit through Visa control and baggage collection was fast by Uzbek standards.",Detractor
" London to Istanbul. The departing gate and boarding experience was good, people boarded quickly and the sequence worked well. The cabin of this new 737 was clean and bright, for a economy seat the legroom was ok with a standard seat pitch of 34 or so inches. A cheesy safety video was shown before takeoff featuring lego figures. A little too cheesy after been shown twice, once in Turkish and once in English. Drinks were served after take off in a punctual fashion and was soon followed by a superb in flight meal of lamb kebab and rice, a good looking vegetarian Dahl was available too. Drinks included average wines and rice beer, along with soft drinks and Turkish coffee. The cabin crew where good and well turned out, including a chef working in the galley for business class passengers. The rest of the flight was fine. This plane did not feature IFE, other than some magzines. We were disembarked at a remote stand and spent 20 minutes on a bus trundling across a dark airfield to a packed transfer hall.

" I was flying from Alexandria to Atyrau through Istanbul on Jan 15, 2019. The luggage was tags were printed fine all the way to Atyrau but the Turkish Airlines Supervisor asked the agent to check it only yo Istanbul. He was rude and obnoxious. He claimed that this was because I have two different ticket numbers which is very common anywhere else on earth. He said the same to someone else who was going to London but he received a phone call from superiors to make this passenger luggage go all the way to London. When I complained, he threatened to float my flight. He was shouting at everyone and when when his colleagues offered to intervene, he shut them down.

 Mumbai to Los Angeles via Istanbul. The estimated departure of TK9 (BOM-IST) was 6:55 am which actually departed at 7:55 am it was delayed because of some connecting flight and other reasons. My experience in both flights form BOM-IST and IST-LAX was way too different. BOM-IST review: Communication: The communication done by the pilot with passengers was awful they spoke something in Turkish and mumbled some English. All I understood was word THANK YOU. The quality of speakers used for the announcement was very cheap. The flight crew had a very different attitude in this flight they didn't communicate well with passengers and was just doing work like robots. Not listening to queries and moving on with next passengers. They didn't even greet their incoming passengers. Food quality was OKish. No menu card was provided. Overall the Flight was clean with old interfaces. My front seat was torn apart with some internals clearly seen. IST-LAX review: The communication was very clear in English the speakers were fine. The cabin crew was friendly and accommodating understood passengers well and heard all my queries. Helped me with my bags. Greeted us while coming in and going out. Food: Food was awful. When given meal preference was an Asian vegetarian meal please for god sake dont serve ITALIAN PASTA. Menu card was provided. Flight: This flight was cleaner with newer interfaces and good seats. The flight arrived 1 hr late. Overall Review of Turkish Airlines: Istanbul airport security lady was extremely rude. She can't even understand basic English. Passengers are in hurry and tired and in that mindset even such small things make a big impact on passengers. My Mumbai to Istanbul flight was awful and Istanbul to Los Angeles was good. They do really discriminate passengers from different regions. Providing different services to different passengers.I have traveled quite a lot but never gotsuch treatment.,Detractor

" Kilaminjaro to Chicago via Istanbul. My problems began the day before the flight, I had booked a Turkish Airlines award business class ticket using United Mileageplus miles months earlier, but the day before noticed I couldn't select my seat and part of my flights were missing from the itinerary. I called Turkish Airlines to confirm everything was but for some reason I couldn't select my seat, so to arrive to the airport early. I arrive the next day to the airport 3 hours early in Kiliminjaro airport in Tanzania and it turns out there is a massive problem with my ticket. A Turkish airlines agent later said it was ""it was award ticket and NO REC on your onward boarding pass"""" which I have no idea what it means but the agent was smashing away at the keyboard for hours trying to get me on the flight to the point they had to hold the flight to Istanbul. At the very last minute I was finally I was able to board and the Turkish airlines agent said I shouldn't have any more problems, but once I get to Istanbul I need to get my next boarding pass and that my bag would arrive just fine to Chicago (both of these turned out to be false) Already having a bad day,I was informed that for the duration of the flight I would only receive economy service and meals despite booking a business class ticket. Once I arrived to Istanbul, more problems began as the transfer desks agents were extremely unhelpful just ping ponging me from one desk to the other with no agent willing to print my boarding pass or ticket. As it got closed to boarding time I told a transfer desk agent I'm not leaving until they print me my pass which I paid for and I was bound to miss my flight! In the end a desk agent in Istanbul wrote me ticket by hand 30 minutes before the flight was set to take off and told me to run! This ticket got me past security and it seemed everything was ok until I got to the gate and once again they denied me boarding, while they grabbed my passport and the agents again smashing on a computer keys trying to get me boarded. Then they tried to claim that my ticket was only economy until I showed them the receipt, at this point they were once again, holding the next plane up for me. At the very last second they finally let me board the flight to Chicago. Once arriving to Chicago I was once again greeted with more bad news. My bag had not made it so I asked them to ship the bag to Mexico City (where I live). They said I would need to pick it up at the airport ""the next day."" Well turns out the next day was a whopping 5 days later. When the bag arrived it was completely destroyed. The nightmare doesn't end there. I figured they would be quick to provide compensation over such an incident, especially over an expensive long distance business class ticket but was I wrong. Once I began the process I sent them all relevant details including pictures of my damaged bag, and receipts totalling about $500 for various purchases I had to make for the 5 days I didn't have my bag. Then they said that they couldn't pay me anything for my damaged bag because they needed a ""repair invoice"" when they originally said a financial request will suffice in lieu. At that point I had already thrown my damaged baggage away.",Detractor

Cheap stuff. For an around 6 hour flight, no menu cards were provided. The crew serving never bothered to ask if passengers needed anything. One had to look around what others were eating and ask for it. The worst part was the next flight, from Istanbul to Frankfurt. It was again A330-200. And everything on this flight was perfect.

As a result, we had to buy another ticket on Turkish Airlines for 18th December 2018 at the airport which cost us TRY 21519 and this was through no fault of our own.

The fact that I booked extra legroom seat and a plane was changed without any notification (resulting in regular seat) only adds to an unpleasant experience. This was not a low-cost flight, but services appeared so. Food and on-board services won't fix these problems.",Detractor
" Istanbul to Abuja. Turkish Airlines switched my seats selected through online check in, so that my family was separated. There was no need for this that was ever explained to me, leading me to conclude it was carelessness and incompetence when I did my baggage drop. They changed my seats during baggage drop. Then, they messed up and put an infant in an emergency row seat. So then I had an infant put beside me along with his father, whereas before that I had an empty seat beside me. No apology from the staff. Terrible organization and service. Will not fly them again.",Detractor
" Brussels to Istanbul via Beirut. We have been failed by this horrible airline in so many ways. To start, we have booked our Christmas tickets on July 1st to secure a place for a fair price. The night before the flight. We go online to check in and discover that our connection flight from Istanbul to Beirut has been cancelled and we were automatically put on the previous connection flight that leaves before we arrive from Brussels. The system allowed the check-in and did not see anything wrong in the combination of flights. We call the customer service to make a change of flight three times and in all times the agent was unhelpful, unready for a conversation, and insisted that if we wanted to make it to Beirut, the only option would be leaving on the 23rd of December to arrive on the 24th, knowing that our initial booking was departure and arrival on December 21st. The only other option given was to fly on the 25th or get reimbursed with the ticket price paid in July to be able to buy a new ticket on another airline the day of the flight, which of course you understand how ridicule this is. So being scared to miss the opportunity to see my family this Christmas, we took the 23rd December option. After that, I researched more thoroughly the options and discovered that they were other options that made us get in time for our connection flight on the 21st, with available seats, that the agent had not only not offered, but also assured there were none. I confirmed with another Turkish airlines agent the availability of taking this flight I found, me, the client, who did what they were supposed to do if they were competent. However, now that I had agreed on the change of ticket for the 23rd, to be able to make my new change, policies applied all of the sudden, when they were completely at fault since the beginning. To make the change we had to pay a 100â‚¬ per person plus airport taxes plus the difference in price for the tickets which changed from 360â‚¬ per person to 680â‚¬ per person, which is completely scandalous since so far, all problems come from a failed system that never notified us about a change in flights, an agent who didn't do his job, and a customer service that is completely indifferent. To try to rectify the situation, I have stayed awake from the 20th night till 8am the next day, supposedly drafting a claim with the claim center without any proof of that, having the agent give me repetitively robotic textbook answers and telling me to wait. After staying awake, we never heard back from our urgent request. Missed our solution option with the plane leaving. I stayed on the phone trying to take the next available solution. Our file is ""still in process"" with no solution, missing all our option to get there before the 24th. This company behaves worse than a low-cost airline. Insults the customer and their intelligence. Hires people who neither have the proper English nor the empathy to deal with a client. Is frustrating and shameful. I am missing important family moments I have planned for months ahead because of this airline, its system, its employees. As for recommendations if you want to go to Beirut. Pegasus, a low cost, is much more efficient and respectful. Middle East airlines was definitely a good experience, I had a problem once with Aegean airlines, but they solved it on the spot not leaving for me room to complain.",Detractor
"  Paris to Dar es Salaam via Istanbul. Turkish Airlines is at best unreliable. The nightmare started in August but let me say all in until I travelled in December I changed the ticket 3 times. Every time 'schedule changes'. Then when I travelled, they lost my bag. When they found it, there was a missing item! I wasn't alone missing a luggage at the airport. Turkish airlines is just very unprofessional. I bought their ticket because of competitive prices, but if I calculate the ticket price and the time and money to call them (because of their issues), I should just have bought a ticket from a superior company like Emirates or Qatar. Spare yourself from ruining your vacations and avoid these unprofessional people!",Detractor
" Vienna to San Francisco via Istanbul. Flight experience was ok and satisfying. Customer complaints handling a disaster. TK did not credit status miles as on the ticket. But no way to get an answer why. All online contacts tried. Autogenerated answers, refusal to accept messages in language of home page. Refusal of message because form not filled completely (no miles and smiles number, we cannot deal with your message). And last ""You may contact with related Airlines customer service for the transactions"". All from email accounts that would not accept answers. My take is clear: TK does knowingly produce wrong and misleading information on tickets, and laugh at customers asking for remedy for non provided services. Hence, neither me nor any company member I have to authorize will fly TK from now on.",Passive
" Istanbul to Los Angeles. Ground crew is just terribly unhappy. Rude and condescending. They are unhappy with their jobs and it shows. None of them actually care about their company which reflects on the leadership. Therefore the customer experience is bad all around. You get what you pay for and that's Turkish airlines for you. The incident that prompted this review is the fact that I dropped my glasses. I waited for all the passengers to leave and then started looking for them. As I was looking for them, their crew instead of helping asked me to leave the plane assuring me that they will look for it and bring it to baggage claim. When I reached baggage claim they said wait for a few minutes and we will let you know. Another 15 min go by and they found them, told me to pick them up at the check in counter at departures. So I walk up there and the lady at the desk is just unhappy. She tells me it'll be 45 min and they can't mail them to me, So I wait. One and half later someone shows up with glasses that are not mine. They said wait till we find more, two more pairs come up and still not mine. Another 45 min go by and nothing. So basically 500 dollar glasses down the drain. Bottom line, if you drop something don't leave the plane, they will try to push you out and then they wouldn't care. I would say go pay a little more and pick better service. It's not that I lost something, it's how the crew treated me after having dropped an item that I could have retrieved if they had let me look for it",Detractor
" Turkish Airlines needs to offer transfer service options (maybe even check in at pick up location) like Emirates does if it wants to remain competitive as the current arrangements for the new Istanbul Airport are greatly inadequate. The check-in kiosks are still not operating reliably. TGS staff were present to offer assistance. However I can not see TK moving all operations in less than a month without damaging their overall product and reputation as the new airport still lacks a proper lounge (the Turkish Airlines Corner arrangement although a improvement from a weeks ago still just a makeshift), restaurants, retail and other basic facilities. Boarding conducted in a orderly manner and on-time departure. The 2Ã—2 seating business class product on this fairly new 737-800 is as good as it gets with IFE and ample space. The breakfast offering was of good quality with a tasety Turkish cheese selection and cold cuts. The scrambled eggs main dish was average. Very good selection in the bread basket. Attentive crew and smooth landing on time arrival to Baku, which is probably the best airport in the region and a pleasure to fly in to. TK offering a very good onboard product with major shortcomings on the ground, IT and customer service side devaluing their product.",Promoter
" Turkish Airlines is the best domestic service and value within Europe. Turkish domestic flights across the board are quite cheap by EU and US standards, having paid $40 for a flight comparable to Boston-New York or London-Paris. Boarding was quite speedy and orderly, and what a treat to be on an enormous long-haul aircraft like the Boeing 777-300ER on such a short route, really feels special. Legroom and seat width are stellar by domestic or international standards, with a very neat and clean appearance. Inflight entertainment was not activated for this roughly hour-long journey, but a standard Turkish-style warm cheese sandwich was provided, the quality of which rivals $9 buy on board options in the USA. Cabin crew, of course, were professional and quick but not rushed. Arrival into Izmir was smooth, and we arrived at an actual gate, as opposed to needing to take a bus from a remote stand. Overall, this journey was well worth spending a few more bucks than the bus or flying Pegasus.",Promoter

Its better sleep in cooler, because you have blanket, clothes to add on! Even cheap ticket cost, I like to pay 100e more, for decent air carrier.",Detractor
"  Toronto to Cairo via Istanbul. Worst experience ever. On the way to Cairo there was a snow storm and all flights announced that they will be delayed. Turkish Airlines insisted that they will leave on time, instead we were all boarded and locked inside the plane, on the ground for 3.5 hours! Because of the delay, I missed my connection flight, which happens all the time. The issue was how they handled it. We were given no information on the plane on what to do now that we missed our flights. We just had to walk around and ask randomly. They said we have to stay in the country as there are no flights till tomorrow and that they will pay for the visa we purchased. They put us in a hotel and I contacted them 11 times and objected twice as they refused to pay me back for the visa purchased. They finally agreed to pay only 28 USD but what I actually paid was 70 USD. On the way back , they were also delayed for 3 hours and again I missed my connection flight and the exact same happened. Only this time they had no straight flights to Canada. So I had to fly to Heathrow and from there to Toronto. Workers are rude and they told me : well, if you think we are always late then just don't take Turkish Airlines. I hated every aspect of that trip, they need to work on their customer service. All I wanted from them was to give exact and clear information on what can be done to deal with them being late. Instead, they just let us wander around and wasted Everyone's time. Never again will I go with them even if the alternative is more expensive.",Detractor
" Ankara to Frankfurt on Turkish Airlines. Quick check in using the priority counter. Following passport control headed to the lounge which was too warm and had the very basic selection of food and beverages. This lounge is worlds away from TK's lounge in Istanbul and one of the worst I have ever visited. The WiFi did not work despite repeated attempts. Headed to the gate well in advance of boarding time and much to my disappointment we were bussed to the aircraft when there were several vacant air bridges. On board the hard product was decent and having chosen an emergency exit row I had plenty of legroom. The service was extremely slow and by the time I received my lunch it was already cold. Food was well below the standard I had come to expect from TK and I see this as a telltale sign of service deterioration. FA's went about executing their duties as if they were on autopilot. The IFE had a good selection and like my inbound journey, the audio jack did not work well causing frequent loss of audio. The flight departed and arrived on time. Despite being tagged as â€œPriorityâ€ my bag took considerable amount of time to come out and was delivered well after those that were not tagged as such. I have been using TK regularly in recent years and the decline in quality has been steady. The next time I travel to Turkey, I will most likely choose a different carrier.",Detractor
" Frankfurt to Ankara. Checked in well in advance as I was connecting from an overseas flight. The agent had difficulty locating my reservation despite having been presented with an electronic boarding pass and my passport. At the gate, boarded with the priority group given my status on Star Alliance. On board, the hard product looked good and with the exception of my audio jack the seat functions worked well. Following take off we were offered lunch with two options for main course. The food was tasty for economy class and the portions were OK. Several beverage choices including beer, wine and spirits were offered. The IFE had a glitch where every movie choice was directed to the wrong film each time. The seat was comfortable enough for economy. The flight pushed back and landed on time. I have taken multiple international and domestic flights with TK in recent years and as with my previous flights, this one had passengers standing up and walking to the front of the aircraft while taxiing. The FA's did not force them back to their seats and simply replayed the pre-recorded safety message. As a result, the plane taxied for about 10 minutes with several passengers standing in the aisle and opening overhead bins risking the safety of others around them. Whilst most of my on board experience has been pleasant with TK I am appalled to see that their FA's do not enforce the most basic safety rules and simply ignore violations. This is a very concerning display of TK's safety culture and raises questions about the rest of their operations.",Detractor
" Ankara to Amsterdam via Istanbul. After a mediocre Business class flight to Turkey with them, we decided to stay at Economy for our flight back. The IFE is pretty good and worked well for me. Food and drinks are also okay. However cabin service was way too slow for a very short ESB-IST flight which over-hastened the eat and drink joy for half of the plane. IST-AMS service was alright, although the food quality is drastically decreasing. Their ground service and staff have major setbacks everywhere, only getting worse. Also, the seat pitch for both flights were literally terrible - barely 30 inches each. Their economy seat pitch does not put them above the category of low-cost carriers. They used to be my favorite airline, not anymore. I no longer prefer them if I have another major airline option on any route.",Detractor

You receive an amenity kit on the long haul flight, which is a nice touch. There is live television and WiFi on board, but the Wifi was quite expensive. The live television worked perfect, I could watch a live soccer match! Downside is that the crew sometimes a bit tired looks and act. The layover in Istanbul is a bit chaotic. My bags arrived in Havana and also on the way back in Amsterdam. My conclusion is that Turkish Airlines offers a good product, when you compare it with the price. I would choose them again and can recommend them.",Promoter
"  Dublin to Phuket via Istanbul. Boarding queuing up everyone in the queue for a while they decided to call rows out we were nearly first going in and nearly last by the end not a good start, went down hill from there on.  Seats mixed up even though we asked for certain seats luckily some people swapped with us - we asked one one of the staff could they please sort the seats out, they didn't care. We had to do it ourself as we have 2 small daughters not sitting beside us. Nothing for kids no kids menu or kids toys or colouring books to keep them entertained for the flights. .The staff from Istanbul to Phuket were the worst most miserable people we have ever came across on a flight.

" Amsterdam to Ankara via Istanbul. Turkish Airlines is a difficult airline to review with varying ups and downs. Business cabin is pretty good with comfortable seating but without an all-aisle access layout that misses window seats for this. IFE screen size and selection is very good but there was a problem with my system which had to be rebooted for 3 times and I could only start a movie near the end of the flight, and I could not finish of course. Although not perfect, cabin service is good, but ground service is undeniably terrible. I barely could catch my transit flight after a very long, chaotic and totally unassisted sweaty rush from one side of Ataturk Airport to the other. Many airlines, mostly from Asia, set the bar to a very high level recently which clearly pushes Turkish into a way lower tier for such treats. I would not pay a dime extra for Business and straightly prefer Economy class with this airlines, especially for short and mid hauls.",Passive
" Istanbul to Beirut. My flight with Turkish airlines was my worst experience ever. We were a group of 6 people travelling together and it happened that we faced many problems due to the disorganization of the airport and the airline. To start with, we arrived about 2 hours and a half earlier than our flight to the airport. We had to wait like more than half an hour for the passport control due to the congestion, noting that not all counters were available. Then, the staff were shouting on us to remove our shoes and get in the scanner machine and all do not speak English so we had many difficulties to understand what they want. How come that an international airport has only Turkish speaking staff, and rude staff. Next, we went to check in with tax refund process, and here, in this airport happens what does not happen in any airport in the world: They need to check your baggage, you have to open and search for the items in the airport in order to have your invoices stamped. What a shame. We got delayed due to this process, but still we were safe and on time. Due to the disorganization and the non helpful staff who were shouting on us and telling us to move faster when scanning our items, we lost a cell phone. We were told we had to go to the lost and found office and everyone you ask in this airport tells you to go in wrong directions so we got lost. We lost lots of time and we arrived at the gate 15 mins earlier, after running miles and miles to reach our gate after 15 mins of running. The staff taking care of checking passports was still available in the gate but refused to check our passports since boarding had ended 2 mins ago. We had to buy new tickets, even though we were at the airport and we checked in on time. Concerning Turkish airlines, we were told that we had to pay only the fare rates which is not too much because we are transferring our tickets, and we were surprised to know that the fare rates were higher than a brand new ticket. So we bought new tickets for all of us. Also to mention that we were told by the transfer desk of Turkish airlines and by the sales office of Turkish airlines that our bags were unloaded and they will be transferred to our new ticket. However, our bags arrived to Beirut with the flight that we missed, and when we were complaining about our bags they did not help us and were insisting that the bags are still in Turkey, till we showed them the pictures of our bags with our parents in Beirut, who managed to take them from Beirut international airport. This was my worst flight ever, I didn't receive any help from anyone in the airport and anyone from the Turkish Airline staff, but I was always told wrong information and sent in wrong directions and even my bags were not organized to stay and arrive with my new flight. This flight and this airport is never to be recommended.",Detractor

My friends luggage got lost and they offered him nothing and didn't return any of his emails or calls whilst we were away!

"  I flew from Izmir to Montreal via Istanbul on Turkish Airlines. I hadn't flown Turkish in 4 years, and was a little worried because of some of the reviews I have read. I had nothing to worry about. The flight was excellent from Izmir to Istanbul on a B777, even time for a small sandwich and coffee on the 1 hour flight. As usual, not enough gates at Ataturk airport, and we were bussed to the domestic terminal. This should be a thing of the past when Turkish Airlines moves to the New Istanbul Airport in early January 2019. A quick walk over to the International terminal and then boarded my flight to Montreal on a A330-300. The flight crew was excellent and had a good grasp of english. They were friendly and helpful. The infotainment system on Turkish is excellent with a wide assortment of movies, tv shows, and I loved the live TV. Two very tasty meals, a good selection of drinks, and snacks available in the galley throughout the flight. The restrooms were kept clean throughout the flight as I could see the flight attendants checking them often and cleaning if needed. The return flights were the same, excellent staff, bathrooms kept clean, food was very tasty. The only downside was having to be bussed to the International Terminal at Ataturk and it was pouring rain, the stairs had no cover. One of my bags didn't make the transfer to Izmir in Istanbul, but I reported it to Turkish Ground Services in Izmir, and it was promptly delivered the next morning.

Once boarded, everything was smooth again. I love the new Turkish in-flight safety video. There were a couple of new movies that I watched on the IFE system. They still have random episodes of TV Series which is interesting. The food was better than usual, with ground beef stuffed eggplant, rice and tzatziki sauce. The second meal they served (Mac and Cheese) was alright as well. I usually like Turkish's food, but this time I was actually impressed as they somehow outdid themselves.

TK has a few check-in counters operational for limited international operations. Self check-in kiosks were not available yet. No fast track either for security or passport control. No lounge, just a makeshift arrangement with limited service. Quite a major step backwards to the current arrangement for B/C and TK FFs at Ataturk airport. The terminal also rather unremarkable compared to other major hubs around the globe. Boarding uneventful and not very organized in typical TGS fashion. On board TK is very good as usual. Excellent breakfast served with inspiring menu and attentive crew. The hard product also very good with 2x2 seating, IFE and fresh looking cabin on this relatively new 737-800.

"  Dublin to Cape Town via Istanbul. First time flying Turkish Airlines. Check in and boarding all very efficient. Hadn't even been on an aircraft with a 2-4-2 seating arrangement, but this is perfect for couples (was travelling with fiancÃ©e) as no need to disturb anyone else if needing out of our seats. Cabin crew were professional and efficient in meal and drinks services. Enjoyed the safety video, if a bit cheesy! Some downsides would be only adequate leg room for a 6'3"" man like myself, expensive on board WIFI ($9.99 for a hour) and cabin crew turning a blind eye to foolhardy impatient passengers who insisted on getting up and opening the overhead lockers while the plane was still taxiing!

Is this a joke? The whole policy is set out in a way that exploits the customer. Every single change costs hundreds of Â£Â£Â£. Even something as simple as changing title will now cost an additional Â£500 for a new ticket. How can you have a system so inefficient.

The Turkish lounge is vast but starting to look worn. I assume there is no desire to spend money ahead of the move to the new airport. Turkish remains my airline of choice.",Promoter
" Prague to Washington via Istanbul. Due to weather issue, most of passengers' luggage came a day after our flight landed. Everyone had to wait at least another one and a half-two hours or even more at the airport for this. That's okay this thing can happen. However, I talked to agents of Turkish Airlines about my luggage and their attitudes were terrible. I felt like I was the one who did wrong. They said I should've carried on the plane with me if I had something that important. I get it. I'm not saying it's not my fault at all. However, they should've not said that with that kind of attitude and treated me like I'm the one who made all this mess. I will not use this airline again. Very disappointed. Plus my seat was terrible. Don't know why, I wasn't able to push the seat back so had to fly 12 hours with the uncomfortable seat. I told one of the crew members about it but she didn't care so I just left it like that because I didn't want to make any trouble.",Detractor

 Edinburgh to Thessaloniki via Istanbul. Having read previous reviews I was a little worried as we were transferring through Istanbul with a very short time between flights.

All in all I was pleasantly surprised and I would travel with them again.,Promoter
" Lvov to Johannesburg via Istanbul. The first leg was flown by a A321. Check-in was smooth and efficient. The plane seemed to be pretty old, with an old school PTV - there is PTV, but it's not touchscreen nor anything on demand, you could only choose from the few existing channels. Since it's a flight less than 2 hours so it's not a big problem. A excellent light meal was served. I had a long layout in Istanbul so I left the airport for a while. Istanbul airport was a bit crowded, that's why the new airport is opening soon. The next flight, IST-JNB, is on a A333. The food was also good - probably the best food I've ever had in economy, but there's only one option if you didn't book special meal, so it might be a problem with some people. The seat pitch wasn't very good for a long haul flight but still acceptable. Amenities were good. Overall, I was impressed and would definitely like to travel with TK next time.",Promoter

After reading the reviews I understand that I am not the only one, so yes all the bad reviews are accurate don't waste your time with this airline pay a little bit more and get better service. They might have good deals for their flights but trust me you will pay. Specially for a long flight and you don't want to bother with their rudeness not only in the cabin but specially with their horrible check in counter staff can't care less. Also if you don't speak Turkish you are totally screwed. I flown to Asia before for 17 hours plus.

" We have just returned from our honeymoon to Mauritius of which we flew from London to Mauritius via Istanbul. When we checked into the flight (hours before departure) at London Heathrow, we mentioned that we were on our honeymoon to request some good seats or potential recognition of this monuments trip which is typically offered by other airlines. What followed was both underwhelming, and, quite frankly, offensive. On the 9 hour outbound flight between Istanbul and Mauritius, we were told at check-in that we would be allocated an entire Central row as the flight was not full, so we were individually allocated seats 15D and 15G (as the plane had 4 seats in the central row). Instead of being allocated the row as promised by the check-in attendant, seats 15E and 15F were allocated to two other passengers meaning that not only was this trivial attempt at recognition of our honeymoon trip not honoured, but we had to sit apart for the entire 9 hour journey to Mauritius! We were also told that we could not change seats even by the cabin crew when I spoke with them. A similar lack of empathy for our honeymoon was demonstrated by Turkish Airlines on our return journey also. In summary, if you are planning for a special trip (E.g. A honeymoon), I would strongly recommend choosing another airline as Turkish Airlines knowingly separated us for our outbound trip. Thank you for ruining our honeymoon journey.",Detractor

Naturally I had to go home as soon as possible, we had to cancel our trip. My son, who had lost his grandmother had to deal with the customer service employee who was unempathetic and dismissive. We wanted to change our return tickets which was from Hong Kong to Istanbul on Sunday and asked them to change it to Beijing to Istanbul on Wednesday. We were told by the Turkish Airlines representative we had to pay the price of a new ticket because our ticket was no-change, but we could get the refund after we present them with the death certificate of my late mother. We had to take this option as we had to be there on time for my mothers funeral. When I went to the Turkish Airlines office in Turkey after 10 days, they told me I cannot get a refund because I already used my ticket. I told them this is what the customer service told me, and the reply is ""There is nothing we can do"". But it was the Turkish Airlines representative who persuaded us not to cancel our flights and change them instead. Turkish Airlines deliberately gave us false information on this subject and lied to us for the price of two tickets! A company that sees profit in death of a loved one, is not a company I am willing to work with ever again unless I absolutely have to.",Passive

" Istanbul to Vienna. Most arrogant airline I have ever seen. Asking people to be at the gate 1 hour prior to boarding, which then usually starts 10-20 minutes prior to departure. Sometimes only at the time of departure. No information from gate staff, never, whatsoever. Never apologizes for delay, simply never. Seat pre-booking doesnt work. E-boarding pass can not be issued for flights starting outside Turkey usually, so you need to pick up at the check in counter anyway and do the queue (we have 2018).

" London to Addis Ababa via Istanbul. Why you fly business you expect a flat bed. Alas, on neither my London to Istanbul flight or Istanbul flight did I get it. Not great. Then with a flight leaving at 10.35am - they decide to serve breakfast (about 11.30). Most of us have got up at 6 am to get this flight - what about serving lunch instead? However, this is all minor stuff - what really annoyed me is for the second leg of my return flight (Istanbul to London) they seated me and my partner apart. This is despite the fact that we booked our tickets ages ago! Forgetting common sense, you would have through it pretty basic - wherever possible, seat people who book together, together. It's not rocket science! Despite a call from Addis to Istanbul (which annoyingly cost me over Â£20) to their call centre - there is nothing they can do about this! Question - so if the plane doesn't even do flat seats, and then they don't even seat you together - why fly Turkish Business?",Detractor
" Istanbul to Neveshir. This is a follow-up to my review first posted on 23rd Sept 2018. Well as it turns out, first impressions didn't quite last. Any frequent traveler would have experienced a delay in baggage arrival before, and this had to happen to us on this leg of the trip as well. Simple procedure right? Not with Turkish. While even other budget airlines can provide a proper and decent PIR (Property Irregularity Report), they couldn't. We went to the lost & found offices of 3 airports in turkey - Istanbul, Kayseri and Nevsehir, all of them got us to ""contact a different department"", bla bla bla, basically shrugging off responsibility and bringing us all over the world. When the baggage finally arrived at our hotel, it was an 18 hour delay. That's normal. What wasn't normal was that there were no forms to sign to acknowledge receipt of the baggage! The handling company said that ""we are a third party engaged by the airline"" and there was nothing to sign! While outsourcing of such responsibilities are normal, all other courier companies have let me sign a document at the point of collection to acknowledge receipt as well as to document the time of baggage arrival. So the story continues. When we finally managed to get our hands on a PIR, it was a computer generated one with no letterhead, no company stamp and no signature. A 9-year old could have reproduced the same document using MS word. Most importantly, it did not even state the eventual time of baggage arrival. How is any insurance company going to process a claim if a PIR does not state the time of baggage arrival? So now we are going around the world, from one department to another to yet another again, just to get our hands on a proper PIR. Case is not yet closed.",Detractor

Even though it was barely a 2 hour flight, it made the experience a lot more comfortable. Check in counters were smooth and efficient and did their job well. Seat pitch presented a decent amount of legroom for a narrowbody plane. Breakfast served was delicious too, and with metal cutlery no less! First time on Turkish and I'm impressed. Only downside are the long queues while transiting in Istanbul but I hope that would be sorted out after the new airport opens next month.",Promoter
" Manchester to Ercan via Istanbul. Check in at Manchester was fast and efficient in business class, the reason for that would become apparent later. Plane was due to depart at 1100 but when we went to the gate as advised, the inbound passengers were not being allowed to deplane as the next gate along was loading for departure and presumably the staff were worried that the passengers might get confused. Eventually, we boarded and found we had the business class cabin to ourselves. Plane left 45 minutes late and the service during the flight was, as to be expected, superb. Food was good and tasty and we were able to sleep on this section. The cabin crew were very good. Because of the delay, we were short of time in Istanbul and were ushered straight to our next flight bypassing security. The flight from Istanbul to Ercan was aboard a A321 with the 2+2 seating layout. Boarding for this flight was chaotic as is normal for this airport. The flight was only 1 hour 20 minutes so it was not too bad, but premium economy would be a better description of the business class cabin. The seats were not particularly comfortable and the seat adjust buttons did not seem to work. The meal on this flight was superb.

" Our flight from Venice to Nairobi provided a two-hour stopover in Istanbul.

After having gone through 3 Turkish desk (Ataturk airport is not really small ...) we arrive at the correct one where in an absolutely rude manner they warn us that we would have to wait 24 hours for the next plane.

" I flew with Turkish Airlines on the 2nd of September from Dhaka-Istanbul-London. Don't get me wrong, the service was good. Food was decent, and entertainment was also pretty good. However the one thing that Turkish Airlines is really poor on is transit flight. The airport staff are slow, very ruthless and have no courtesy at all. You may say this is the airport's fault, but this was mainly seen from Turkish Airlines staff. The staff on my flight were a bit rude, and when you asked for something to drink, you would need to ask repeatedly as they wouldn't bring you a drink. Anyways, our flight was delayed from Istanbul.

We landed at London, only to find out that half of the plane's luggage did not arrive. All the transit flight luggage were missing and consequently delayed.

" Istanbul to Prague on Turkish Airlines. Following a smooth check-in processed by a helpful and pleasant agent we made our way to the lounge. The lounge was crowded but there was ample space compared to the cramped, noisy and hot main terminal. Istanbul airport is a nightmare unless you have access to the Turkish Airlines lounge. After a few beverages and snacks we made our way to the gate. Boarding started without an announcement and despite a clearly marked priority lane, it was a free for all with people forming multiple lines converging at the same spot. When I questioned the gate agent about the lack of announcements and the chaotic boarding, she simply shrugged her shoulders and said we were being bussed to the aircraft and in her mind it did not matter. On board the hard product was very good with real business class seats unlike the other European carriers which simply leave empty the middle seat of a 3x3 configuration in economy. After take off, we were served a tasty lunch with three different choices of main course. Beverage offering was decent and included champagne but the red wine was disappointing. The service by FA's was good but it seemed quite inefficient with the two serving the rather small business section running back and forth multiple times to deliver a simple drink request. The seats were comfortable and the IFE had a good selection. The flight pushed back late but arrived on time. The landing was a little unnerving when the aircraft touched down very hard and there was absolutely no explanation from the flight deck. Overall it was a good experience especially on board and in the lounge however, the Turkish Ground Services which is a contracted service, is major downside of this airline.

There was certainly no Turkish Delight on Turkish Airlines yesterday when passengers originating from London on the TK 1986 were left stranded in Istanbul because Turkish Airlines decided to off-load them because an overbooking problem on the onward flight. It's the first time ever in my 30 year career in the travel industry that I've ever been exposed to such unprofesssional service. Most airlines protect international passengers on feeder flights. Even though the flight arrived late, there was still a 30 minute transfer window and we all arrrived at the departure gate before boarding commenced, only to be told that we were all off-loaded. Disgrace, unprofessional service resulting in a 3 hour wait to get accommodated at 3 am in the morning. I'm amazed at how Turkish Airlines pretends to be a global player promoting Istanbul as a global travel hub, when it can't even deal with the basics. A truly nighmare experience. Looking forward to seeing how they resolve my ongoing problems! Travellers beware when booking international connections with Turkish Airlines - the cheaper fares could truly deliver a cheap and nasty experience you'll remember for a long time!",Detractor
" Malaga to Mumbai via Istanbul. Terrible customer service. My surnames were interchanged in the reservation (first in the place of the second and viceversa). They didn't allow me to change it even though I presented all the documents (ID, passport, reservation) to prove that I was the holder of the ticket. I couldn't rectify the data neither online, nor at the Turkish desk, nor on the phone and not even paying a change fee. The only solution they offered was to buy a full new ticket. I am a member of their miles and smiles program. As you can imagine I was not smiling.",Detractor
" Billund to Bangkok via Istanbul. Beside the very short connection in Istanbul that caused me had to run for the next flight, it was a quite good experience. It started with a friendly checkin staff that moved us to the emergency exit row so I had plenty of legroom for my 190cm. Service onboard was good with nice meal for a 3h flight, and crew was a very friendly. The only issue was that they was that they didn't provide gate info for the next flight from Istanbul and our 55 minutes layover was only 40min because of delay on first flight, so we had to run for the most remote gate. Flight from Istanbul to Bangkok was older B777 with 3-3-3 config, with legroom thais equal to Emirates B777 but wider seats. IFE not at the same level as Emirates and old screen. Friendly crew and nice meal. Seat selection is free on Turkish website under manage booking, thats a plus compared to that it has become expensive on Emirates on the 3 cheapest booking classes by Emirates.",Passive
" A disappointing start to our family holiday of a lifetime! Shocking customer service. No communication. Rude, aggressive and miserable staff. Disgusting airport in Istanbul, the list could go on. We were left for over an hour on our flight from Gatwick â€“ Istanbul, the captain came on the radio once to say we were delayed, obviously! No communication whatsoever. Cabin crew were rude and unhelpful. The plane then started moving, followed by taking off yet no checks to see if passengers were sat down or even with their seatbelts on. The plane just took off, not even an announcement was made. We missed our connecting flight to the Seychelles in Istanbul where 9 of us including a 4 year old had to wait at the airport for 17 hours. They were unaccommodating, rude and their customer service ability was non-existent and shocking. They said we could stay in a hotel if we paid for the hotel, taxi and visa. We were left at the transfer desk for 4 hours where we were just repeatedly told wait. They couldn't tell us anything or help us in any way. When they finally did sort our boarding passes out they had missed one of us off. After 4 hours they then said we could have a food voucher and a rest area, this was gone 4 hours of asking and waiting. When arriving at the rest area the lady working said we couldn't go in because we had the wrong passport. She found it funny when we pointed out to her that we had a 4 year old asleep in a trolley. She was laughing with her colleague which was infuriating and highly unprofessional. The toilets were disgusting. Another delayed flight made us miss yet another connecting flight to Dubai this time, this resulted in another 9 hours at Dubai airport. It took us 72 hours to get to the Seychelles where we missed 2 days of our holiday. We didn't think we would have the same carry on returning, unfortunately we did! Another 5 hour delay for what reason it was unknown. Going back to that desk at Istanbul with again rude and unhelpful staff was soul destroying. They then put half of our group in Business class half in economy. An absolute shambles. Never fly with this airline, they were horrendous in every aspect.",Detractor

Went to Turkish Airlines transfer desk to complain and informed me that they will compensate me with a food voucher to use in the food court!Aside from all of this Istanbul airport is the worst ever, cramped with people everywhere, toilets are horrible and rude staff.

" Detroit to Vienna via Istanbul. This is a complaint about the flight from Istanbul to Vienna (8/22/2018). I booked my flight since March 2018 from USA and have chose my seats in advance. I checked in at Detroit airport then again at Boston airport and received my boarding pass with the seat numbers that I have chose. During my actual flight from Istanbul to Vienna I was told that my seat is not available (6F) and was told to sit at 6D instead.. I went inside the plane, and I saw the entire seats occupied at (6). I notified the flight attendant, she said ok go back to the end of the plane. I refused to do so! She called the manager , and she told me that those people will not not leave their seats and that's I have only two options, either to leave the flight immediately and wait for the next flight or to go and accept seat 20C. The flight attendants were rude with me even during the inflight service. I don't think I will travel with this company again.",Detractor
" New York to Istanbul. Check-in staff at JFK airport were incredibly rude and unhelpful. I had very little time to board as standby and they held me up for ages over checking my carry-on because a group of them rudely pointed out to me there was no way it qualified as a carry on. (It had on Delta, however). Extremely unprofessional as a group of them stood behind the counter talking and laughing about me while I was paying to check my now extra bag. They were so cold and unable to empathize, that for that experience alone I would never willfully fly Turkish Airlines again. On the flight I pressed the call button twice because I never had time to grab water and the small glass they give you a couple times isn't enough for an 11 hour flight. My light was turned off both times and I was ignored each time. I felt sick the entire flight because I needed water desperately. Cabin crew were not very friendly and seemed quite stressed out. When passengers were up and confused about the direction of where to go they were curtly told â€œyou can't pass through hereâ€ and then ignored. No smile, nothing. Such a terribly disappointing experience. Oh and the bathrooms were out of toilet paper for a long time.",Detractor
" The plane was a fairly new A330-300 (TC-JOF, first flew in 2015). Boarding a Turkish flight used to be a challenge, but not this time. They divided us into business, economy row 27 which worked really well. Standard Turkish Airlines economy cabin, the seat itself not very comfortable, okay legroom. Not better or worse than any other economy seat on a wide-body plane. I usually love the food on Turkish Airlines, both quality and quantity-wise. However this time, the food wasn't as good as it used to be, especially the rice. (It hasn't been that long since I last flew Turkish). Quantity-wise it was fine, we got served dinner, snacks and a breakfast. The crew, on the other hand, was outstanding. Way better than any other TK flight I've taken. They were really nice and helpful, and actually wanted to talk to people! There were plenty of new films on the IFE system. I usually don't watch any films on the IFE, but I watched 4 films this time! We departed on time and actually landed early (I think they do it in case they need to fly around IST before landing). I got the in-flight Wi-Fi for 15$ and it worked fine.",Promoter
" Karachi to New York JFK via Istanbul. It was my first time experiencing with Turkish Airline. I bought 3 tickets and for most part this airline is rather cheaper than its competitors such as Emirates and Qatar. However, you do pay a price with horrible customer service and in flight food menu. Their customers service representatives provide nearly no accurate information. Staff won't be very polite and if you lose baggage you are pretty much on your own.

" Istanbul to Dubai. My flight was at 12:30am, and I was off to the airport by 8pm. Upon check in they told me the flight has been delayed by 30mins. Seeing as to how the domestic flight on Turkish I took (Kayseri to Istanbul was delayed a good 1.5hr just the day before, leaving my Friend stranded in Istanbul for a day due to a missed connection), I was dismayed. I asked the reception check in counter the reasons for a delay flight, and she shrugged it off and said she didn't know. I said well of all people she should have the best idea, it's ridiculous. Anyway with plenty of time to spare, and the crowded Istanbul airport boarding gate screening not having a gate number displayed yet, I spent a good 3 hours at various cafes and restaurants, periodically checking the board for my flight gate details. The thing was, my flight was not displayed. I realised much later that I had referred to it's revised flight departure time instead of its original departure time, making it confusing this really infuriated me at the airport. When it was very close to boarding time and i still couldn't detect my gate number, I queued at the Turkish Airline counter queue (which by now is full of passengers on several delayed flight), only to be told I had missed my flight! By then it was 30 mins before departure time and the gate was a good 20mins away. I ran like mad to gate 709, and there was no one left. I was hissing mad, this was not even my fault, a delayed flight with a horrible screen layout that couldn't even tell me 1 hour beforehand my appropriate gate details. And now Turkish airlines is refusing to refund this ticket or cancel the no show fee. I was stranded in Istanbul for another day and had to shell money out for another flight home. Horrific and worst airline experience ever. Throughout the ordeal all Turkish Airline ground staff were rude, short tempered and condescending. They never offered to help or apologise in short putting all blame on their passengers. I will never ever fly them again - hell they are not even the cheapest, just spend that few extra hundred to be on Emirates or other more reputable airline. They don't deserve to be in the skies and in business.",Detractor
" Singapore to Tel Aviv via Istanbul. For some reason the flight to Istanbul was delayed in about 25 minutes so instead of 75 minutes I only had 50 minutes for the connection. Once landed crew called all passengers to Tel Aviv to hurry up (a delay that was caused because of you), now obviously I was in a hurry and thought it's good that they are aware of the problem and since operating both flights probably leave the gate open a few more minutes. I got to the gate and they just closed it, the ground crew was still there and had last passengers on the jet bridge. Frustrating as it was seeing the plane just standing there for about half hour and the only thing separating me from getting back to my mother's funeral on time was a door. I tried explaining your employees about my special circumstances and hoped for some sympathy and possibly help. What actually happened was the complete opposite! I was mistreated and responded with apathy. I know and understand all airlines follow the same protocol but this was even worse than speaking to heartless robots. I asked customer service to please help me out and give me lounge access or even just a wi-fi that works so I can inform my family and friends I'm not going to be on time for the funeral or possibly find an earlier flight. The answer I got is: ""Lounge is only for business passengers"" so I'm not allowed to go there and I can use one of the restaurant's free wi-fi (obviously didn't work). So had to wait 5 hours for the next flight feeling like nobody cares and really trying to help me. It was not just one of your employees, I spoke to about 8 different people trying to explain my situation and they all kept sending me back and forth until I realized they are just trying to get rid of me. I would not fly with Turkish Airlines if known they are not able to get me in time for the funeral. I never post this kind of things, but I got such a disrespectful service! and think people should know they are the worst!",Detractor

" Washington to Minsk via Istanbul. I am a Deaf passenger. I called IST Hotel Desk office and Turkish Airlines Customer Relations prior to my departure to Istanbul for stopover and Turkish Airlines staff confirmed by phone that they will provide hotel accommodation or tour with breakfast for my long layover - stopover 20 hours after my arrival at IST on August 10, 2018 on way before connecting flight to Minsk, Belarus. Turkish Airlines Customer Relations asked me do not worry and promised that Turkish Airlines will take care of the hotel accommodation very well. They assured that there IST hotel desk will arrange to ensure hotel accommodation will be provided. When I arrived at IST and they refused dumped me away from standard service/accommodation and IST airport staff at hotel desk said that they will not provide me a hotel or tour with breakfast for my long layover 20 hours at Istanbul. I realized that Turkish Airlines is not honest did not follow ethics practice and fooled me against their advertising about stopover program with hotel and tour. I am concerned with Turkish Airlines's lack of integrity and assurance. I slept on floor mat during long layover 20 hours at IST airport. From my understanding, Turkish Airlines website posted all information online that economy class passengers will have a hotel accommodation or tour with breakfast during long layover. They treated me poorly because I am deaf passenger and passenger with disability. I do not appreciate Turkish Airlines' fraud with hotel accommodation or tour with breakfast that were not provided actually. I lost trust in Turkish Airlines. I feel regretting to purchase a ticket and choose to fly with Turkish Airlines. I spent wasted $30 visa for nothing at IST and I did not see Istanbul during stopover - long layover 20 hours.

" Bucharest to Dubai via Istanbul and back. The flight from Bucharest to Istanbul was ok, only 55 minutes time, but they provided snacks and drinks which is wonderful considering the flight time. Istanbul to Dubai on Boeing 777-300er, new plane and excelent cabin crew, they served dinner and beverages. The flight was on time. On the return leg, Dubai to Istanbul, the aircraft was Airbus A330-300, with a 2-4-2 configuration, which was better for us. The plane was a bit older than the previous one, but the entertaining system was ok, plenty of choices to watch. Cabin crew were wonderful, you can tell that they are hard working and also very professional. The only inconvenient is Ataturk airport because it is too crowded, there are a lot of flights departing and landing at the same time and you have to spend a lot of time in the aircraft untill take off and also after landing which causes delays. There weren't any problems with the luggage, but I think that the ground staff that handles the luggage should be more careful as the suitcases came a little bit damaged after the flights. I saw that they are throwing them quite hard when handling. All in all, I would recommend Turkish Airlines.",Promoter

Now, it seems that the company has gone down. I just had the worst flying experience I have ever had (and I travel over 100k miles a year). Flight Aug 31st Kinshasa-Istanbul was delayed 12h, were forced to sleep at the airport because the company kept lying about the time the aircraft was supposed to land instead of getting us into a hotel. When entering the aircraft, they had booked 2, sometimes 3 people on the same seat, which created chaos among a group of already on-edge passengers. During the flight (an almost 8hr flight), all we had to eat was a mini sandwich, no meal. Obviously missed the connection in Istanbul, was re-booked on another flight in a middle seat just to realized at arrival that our luggage were lost in transition. There are 3 flights a day from Istanbul to Brussels, yet it took them 2 days to send our luggage.

I had to call them for the third time today just to hear that the guy has not even left the storage facility yet.

This was my first trip, using miles, to fly in Business Class. The crew was attentive, well-groomed and projected a nice, professional image. The airplane has true Business Class, with 2x2 seating (versus 3x3 with mid seat vacant). However, I was extremely disappointed by the food offerings. No menu, a surprise, and the crew rolled a cart down the aisle showing unwrapped entrees. I selected the fish and sad to say it felt like I was eating a 5TL fish sandwich on the Eminonou dock.

I am sad to say it wasn't, the seat is fine pretty run of the mill business class, does what it says on the tin and had a decent sleep. Where Turkish airlines fails is in its customer service onboard along with the business class menu. Firstly the service on board, there wasn't any real interaction from the crew with their customers, menus' were given out and I was hurried to complete the breakfast menu for later in the flight, welcome drinks were not served until 20 mins after boarding, and champagne had to be requested. The main meal was served, and although it looked pretty it was pretty bland, I chose the chicken, it was dry and tasteless, I have had economy meals in the past and this spread was very much that but served on china. Way below what I have experienced on other carriers. The breakfast meal was just as bad, mainly all choices are based on eggs. Customer service on board, i had the feeling that the crew looking after its business class passengers were lacking in training to work in this part of the cabin, this was apparent from the lack of interaction, the crew spent all the time they could behind the curtain in the galley talking, never walking the cabin to see how their guests are.",Detractor

I had a especially poor experience with one agent who was very condescending and didn't even try to search for answers. I left for a 14-day Safari on July 5th, and upon asking this agent how it would work for the reimbursement for the clothes I purchased, she basically gave me a lesson on how I should buy cheap things. Now, I'm stuck in Africa for 20 days with no bags, no clothes, and Turkish has not even offered me any type of compensation. I was travelling on Business Class and that's how they treat their Business Class flyers.",Detractor

"  Istanbul to Manila. Flying business class for me firstly means I will have a seat which lays flat and more personal space on my long haul travels, along with good food, drink and that certain feeling of being made important, so flying Turkish Airlines for the first time i wondered how they would rate against other carriers? Upon boarding my seat was pointed out to me, I had been settled for 15 minutes before any cabin crew made contact, when I was offered a pre flight drink, orange, lemon mint or water. I requested champagne, and waited another 5 minutes for this to arrive, albeit a very small measure. Flight under way and I was given a handful of menus, for dinner, drinks, wine list and a pre breakfast menu, again I choose champagne as my choice of drink, again I was presented with a small measure. Meal served and what a total disappointment - it looked good if it was colour and presentation you were looking for, and to be honest it was no more than an economy meal served on china. I had to ask for bread as this wasn't offered. Taste wise it was bland, and small in portion and I am unsure as to what purpose a tacky so called candle added to the experience. The toilets had me wondering, there were two in business class yet both were completely different designs, again both resembled what i would expect in economy. Seat was good, pretty run of the mill, IFE, dreadful choice of films & TV, no blockbuster films one would expect. I wanted Turkish Arlines to be good, sorry to say they are not, they are way behind other carriers on the Manila route, way behind other carriers on long haul routes, its certainly a case of running before they can walk.",Detractor
" Paris to Seoul via Istanbul. I lost my baggage and it took three days to get my baggage back. I know it could be happened for anyone to lost baggage, but I am very disappointed from this experience. The thing is, you can't imagine how their customer services are terrible. It's the worst. I called to their customer service center several times in a day to get the updates. They gave me all different information every time and that made me so confused. I tried to contact to the Korean office first, they don't know anything and have no rights to do something about this case and I spoke with four different people from English c/s division since I lost. No one tried to take responsibility, they told me",Detractor
" Algiers to Manchester via Istanbul. I have the same experience word by word as below my review. I missed my connection flight. My first Turkish Airlines plane was late, and the second plane has gone 10 minutes before dest. time. The screen has shown ""go to gate"". But the plane was nowhere. Everybody was so rude at the airport, helpless and their attitude was awful. Finally I had to buy a ticket for the next flight for 342 pounds, because they told me, the plane us full, I can travel only on business class, where actually was a very poor service. Customer service a joke, it was the worst ever.",Detractor
" Zagreb to Singapore via Istanbul. All it takes is just one confident ground crew staff member who empathizes with the emotions of a passenger in distress over mistaking the flight-time 20:05 as the check-in time for 22:05. After a two-week holiday, my husband and I arrived at the airport to check into Flight TK1056. To my horror, I discovered that the gate was closed! And the flight was schedule to take off in 15 minutes! However, we were blessed by the presence of a ground-staff member. I regret not having asked for her name but thankfully, I had taken a snapshot of her while waiting to board the plane and I have attached her picture to this note of thanks. I only realised my mistake when I wanted to check in my luggage at 20:00. I asked the Zagreb airport information staff for help. She calmly and gently directed me to Turkish Airline staff who made a few calls for quick checks, and sprung into action. She got a ground-staff to re-open a counter and made a very quick check-in. She then opened up a channel all through the security checks, immigration process and all the way up to the boarding gate. In ten minutes or less, we were at the boarding gates. What I really appreciate most about her was her knowledge and understanding of the processes involved. She explained to us along the way, that flights from Istanbul to Zagreb had been delayed because Istanbul had experienced very bad weather that afternoon and almost all flights from Istanbul were delayed. So even though I had divine help in that my flight was delayed, I may not have been able to get on board the flight if not for this particular lady who went out on a limb and call in favours through all the channels of security and luggage processing to get our luggage into the cargo-belly of the plane and to rush us to the gate in time for our flight. Thank you, Turkish Airline and Zagreb Airport. On a separate issue, I also would like to add that Turkish airline is also very mindful of the needs of its passengers. I appreciate the night pack that was given during my red eye flight from Singapore to Istanbul and from Istanbul to Singapore. The night pack contains the most useful things for a more comfortable flight.",Promoter
" Zurich to Delhi via Istanbul. I landed Istanbul at 18:40 and after security checks and all took 25 minutes. My next flight was at 20:20. I was confused to go to which gate to take my next flight. I asked few people to find a way. I got to know i have to go to gate no 504. So moved to gate number 504. I reached there at 19:57. The guy who was at boarding counter told me that gates are closed. I told him how is it possible as I have the boarding pass and still there are 23 minutes left. Then he asked me to go to the transfer desk and assure me they will help me in this matter. I rush without debating to that guy and when I reached there the guy laughed at me and asked me to wait for 10 minutes. So that the 20:20 time can be passed. Then he came and ask me to buy new tickets. Instead of helping you mislead a customer and ask him to ran here and there. And the cost for the ticket is too high. When I paid the entire money and have nothing left out I asked them I have no money left for anything to eat. They told me they will provide food every 5 hour - once i got the new ticket and after 14 hour I reached them and asked for food and they denied even for tea. Next day when I boarded the flight, flight delayed for 1:30 hour and we waited without our fault.",Detractor
" Los Angeles to Tirana via Istanbul. I traveled to Albania on April 28th to visit my sister. Once I got there they did not have my suitcase and when I request information they said â€œthey cannot locate itâ€. I arrive with no suitcase and no personal stuff. I went to Airport twice still Turkish had no idea where is my suitcase, so I bought some clothes and hygiene stuff. I kept my receipt. Monday I went back to airport because by phone I could not get respond. Monday by noon we waited there no suitcase. I went back to hotel and at 10pm my hotel customer service called and said my luggage is here. Suitcase was damaged but it was ok with me and I was happy to be able to give all the gift I bought to my sister. After I came back I send a receipt of my purchased items, Turkish send me $41 check as reimbursement. I did file complaint with BBB and they just told me with several request respond from Turkish they never responded to me or BBB. Horrible customer service.

" New York to Istanbul. Our flight to Istanbul (TK2) was at 7:05PM. The crew served dinner only at 10:30PM, NY time. My last meal was around 2.30PM. I was without food for 8 hours and because of my stomach problems, I started cold sweats, and had to take my medications to calm my stomach. I did have food with me, but because I stowed my bag in the overhead bin, I needed a flight attendant to help me take it because I am really short, and could not reach for it. I pressed the flight attendant button, but no one came. In the meantime, my friend who is in business class was saying that they were being fed non stop since they boarded until around past 10PM. Is it possible that all the flight attendant were there in the business class and our dinner was being deferred? I have flown countless times over the past 2 decades, and this is the first time I have been in a plane which did not serve food after the fasten seat belt sign turns off, considering that we only have 10 hours of flight, and another meal will be served before we land. The attention of the flight attendants to the economy class passengers is really poor. During the round trip flight, I was looking for someone to compliment for looking after me, even for just one bit of help, but no one i asked for help ever met my low expectations. This airline has a lot to learn from South east Asian airlines. Another problem. I asked my travel agency to get me a bulkhead seat. My travel agency said that the Turkish airline confirmed that I had a bulkhead seat both ways. Unfortunately, on both travels, my seat on both legs were behind the bulkhead seats. There seems to be a problem with the seat plan they are looking at, which is likely inconsistent with the real seats of the plane. I probably will not take this airline again.",Detractor
" Oporto to Bangkok via Istanbul. Flying to Bangkok to see my father before his operation was going smoothly until I arrived in Istanbul. The flight was originally delayed by 1 hour 50 minutes and kept increasing until we took off almost 5 hours behind schedule. The ground staff had no answer to my questions as to why the flight was late other than it happens often with the flights. Food was served but by the time I reached the front of the line it was finished and I was told 'sorry'. When the flight eventually took off, I was in a seat that was broken and wouldn't recline and the air conditioning was not working properly. I barely slept the entire trip due to stressing about not reaching the hospital on time, and we landed over 3 hours 10 minutes late, with a further 35 minutes before the doors even opened. I am so disappointed as the entire trip from Istanbul onwards was stressful, uncomfortable and there was a total lack of care. The return leg was much better, but I had to make it with a heavy heart. The cabin crew are friendly enough and the food is great, but will I ever fly with them again? I doubt it very much.",Detractor
" Singapore to Belgrade via Istanbul. I've used this airline several times, and each time it's been a pretty bad experience, mostly due to the service which ranges from average to terrible. On my most recent flight, my baggage (and that of many other passengers) arrived completely wet. Everything inside was wet and dirty which caused a great inconvenience for my whole trip. I was transferring through Istanbul and I guess it was raining there, but it was clear that the baggage had been treated inappropriately and carelessly.

" The aircraft was modern with excellent inflight entertainment options (latest movies were available). Food was tasty, and beverage options were great. Even during meals sandwiches and cookies were available. The toilet always has hand cream as well which was useful for our drying skin during the 11+ hour flight. The staff were friendly, and Turkish Airlines always gives out 'care packages' on long haul flights which contains chapstick, slippers, cream, socks, eye cover, earplugs, toothpaste and toothbrush. The airline's magazine is a good read. My flight was delayed by almost 4 hours so I did not reach my connection, had to spend the night in Istanbul. Turkish Airlines provided hotel, shuttle, dinner as they rescheduled me for the next day. On top of this, when I later contacted them about compensation, they fairly acknowledged the lengthy delay in getting me to my final destination and provided compensation as per current flight regulations. The Istanbul Ataturk airport also has plenty of shopping and eating options, smoking area. Overall my experience has been very positive with Turkish Airlines, despite the above mentioned hiccup which they fairly rectified. I would and definitely will fly with them again.",Promoter
" Toulouse to Singapore via Istanbul. Worst airline ever. Before boarding the plane, I chose to have my seats near the exits as I was 6 months pregnant. However, when I boarded the plane, I was told by the guy sitting next to me that I was not supposed to be seated beside him as he told the air steward that he wanted my seat for him and his son. I sat down anyway, as I was not told of it. 5 mins later, the air steward told me to change my seats to accommodate the father and son, and I was moved all the way to the back of the plane. Best part, I have requested for special meals to be served, however, they did not update my special meal request even when they were the one who forced me to have my seats changed. So Turkish is hinting me that you can paid for 2 seats and request for 3? Mind you, it was the seats in the first few rows. Tried sending in a few emails, however, their replies are generic and they takes years to reply.",Detractor
" Miami to Bucharest return via Istanbul. One adult and two children were travelling. Check-in at Turkish counter in Miami was very smooth and quick. The boarding process was done by letters and was very without issues. Onboard I was impressed with the cleanliness of the aircraft and how new it was (no more than 3-5 years old). The Audio-Video Entertainment system was amazing and I would say probably the best I've ever seen with new movies, old movies, blockbusters, etc. The food and beverage selection was great. The kids received goodie bags and everyone received sleepers, toothpaste/toothbrush and sleep mask. The flight attendants were very attentive and smiling. The second leg, IST-OTP was great as well. Flight was operated with an A330-200 which I found odd for such a short leg. Very clean plane, relatively new and same great entertainment system. Flight time was 45 minutes but food was served as well. Return flights were great as well. OTP-IST flown on a B737-700 which did not have personal video screens but food was served and service was great. IST-MIA flown on the same B777-300ER and same great, attentive service. Turkish are still allowing two free checked bags for economy passengers. I would say Turkish service is on par or even slightly better than Lufthansa but at a much better price. WI-FI is available for a price but didn't use it. Charging ports present for each seat. Will definitely fly again.",Promoter

" Mogadishu to Amsterdam via Istanbul./ I flew several times with THY, mostly because of their connections in Middle East and Africa. I hardly experienced planes on time, but delays were acceptable. Therefore I had never before to deal with their customer service. And that one is horrible, as I experienced. THY is not an Eurepean Airline, and therefore they do not have to commit to the European regulation with regard to delays. Although they state on their website passenger rights, which are almost a copy-paste of these regulations, they seems to be there to give you the impression that they take this seriously. My flight has delay due to an incoming aircraft which was late, and I missed my connecting flight. I had to stay over in Istanbul and needed to acquire a visa. Sounds easy. The delay is over three hours and they will reimburse the delay and the cost for the visa. In practice it is not easy to contact them, but finally I managed to get a customer service ticket. After 10 days a lot of regrets and a calculation that it was not their fault. They managed the calculation in such a way that the cause of the delay was only one minute less then the reimbursement threshold. Obviously the calculation was manipulated. For visa cost they advised to issue a new ticket with prove of cost made. I issued that request and asked for underlying documentation to support their calculation. After a while THY sent a voucher for the cost and did not respond on the question of proof. The voucher can be used only at the nearest sales office, and is valid for one year. Not surprisingly the link provided didn't work. The voucher can only be used by me. It is not likely I will fly with THY again, and therefore the voucher is worthless.

Only two minuses were baggage delivery at IST - the monitors are not updated regularly or are too small for such a big number of arrivals so our baggage was already out and we still did not see information about the belt and the staff at the SAW airport.

" Houston to Munich via Istanbul. Do not fly with Turkish Airlines, especially if you fly coach. The online booking system failed repeatedly from the day I booked three seats from Houston to Germany via Istanbul. I booked 8 months in advance. The flight times changed three times, no more than 10 minutes on any leg. I learned that if you have reserved seats and don't call the airline to say you agree with the changes, your seats are not reserved anymore. I was able to reserve three bulkhead seats for the 12 hour leg, but found that our seats were given to a family with a baby and we were moved to the row behind them, which would have been fine except that my son, who is 5'11"" tall could not sit with his knees facing forward because the seats were too close together. When the seats were in the recline position, my daughter who is 5'4"" tall, could not put her legs in the forward position! On our return trip, I tried for two days to reserve and pay over $210 for exit row seats and the Turkish Airlines web site could not process the payment. I tried this option using the iphone app and got farther along in the process, but it ultimately failed, as well. Each time the process failed, I would log out, then log back in and my account would show that our seats were reserved, but not I did not receive a confirmation and there were no pending charges on my credit card. After a few hours I finally decided to call the Turkish Airlines desk in Houston, but because of the time difference, it was closed on Sunday and would be closed on Memorial Day Monday. I then called the Turkish Airlines phone number, +90 212 444 08 492, and the customer service rep stated that two of the seats in exit row were reserved, but were not paid for and she suggested I pay for them online. I explained I was unable to pay for them online and wanted to pay for them through her. She explained that in order for her to do that, she would have to release the seats and they might get reserved by someone else. Since that was the only way I could pay for the seats, I approved releasing the seats - and within seconds the representative said the seats were gone.

" On a recent â€˜round-trip' experience, Denpasar - Budapest, I found myself in multiple disappointing (borderline traumatic) situations with Turkish Airlines. When checking in on my return flight in Budapest in May, 2018, I was told that my return ticket had been cancelled. As a result, I was forced to pay an additional $1,600 to purchase a new one-way ticket on the same flight. Below is a description of what had happened. In April, on the third leg of my flight from Denpasar to Budapest, I missed the flight in Istanbul due to confusion at the gate - poor communication and gate location (ie. heavy traffic surrounding this specific gate, the sitting area hosted multiple flights, unclear instructions and lack of announcements, etc). I had been sitting at the gate for an hour when they started boarding, but was only alerted when priority boarding started --- no more announcements or callouts were made thereafter. When the line began to peter out I started to get a bit concerned, but because there were still so many people sitting around me, which I had presumed they were waiting for the same plane, and no final announcements or staff had called out, I didn't move forward. However, at that time I did ask the people around me what flight they were waiting for, but they just shook their heads and said they did not speak English. At this point I was growing quite concerned and so I ran to the closest Turkish Airlines staff I could find, at a nearby counter. When I showed him my ticket, he began shouting (actually) at me and said that the gate was now closed and I had to go downstairs to the transfers desk. This was only a minute or two after the gate had been closed. I ran downstairs, showed them my ticket and asked what could be done. They said that I had to purchase a new ticket - no alternative was given. To do so, they ordered me to purchase a visa and exit through customs. When outside, I first rushed to ticketing at Turkish Airlines where an employee stated that I had to purchase a new ticket, but that he could not do anything for me and to go see the Turkish Airlines check-in desk. I then proceeded to the check-in desk at Turkish Airlines and they said that I had to purchase a new ticket. At no time I was told that this would render my return flight invalid, and no other information was given. I tried the help-phone for Turkish Airlines as well, but there was no dial tone and no-one was in the area to provide assistance. I finally had to purchase a one way ticket from Istanbul to Budapest for 200 Euros for a flight later that day. To add insult to injury, the Turkish Airlines staff was appalling - I was yelled at and belittled on numerous occasions. I've read other reviews and some have said that Turkish Airlines employees are inhumane, and to be honest, I agree - note: this is specific to the Istanbul Airport staff. My original ticket was over $1,400, and this whole ordeal has cost me an additional $2000. I reached out to Turkish Airlines and although they responded in a timely fashion, they were unhelpful and clearly had not read my story. Furthermore, the avenue of communication they use - feedback forms only, make it very difficult to communicate with them. I suppose that is what they want!",Detractor
 Our flight TK0775 Muscat to Istanbul was delayed about 1h 10 minutes and we missed our connected flight to Brussels. We were transferred to the next flight to Brussels TK1943 from 12:45 but due to mechanical problems only leaved Istanbul around 16:00. Our complain was answered by thy customer service within one week apologising for the inconvenience and offering a fair financial compensation. Refund has been done by Brussels sales department correctly. Delays are uncomfortable but probably inevitable with the crowded airspace and we can only appreciate the understanding and correct way our claim was handled.,Promoter
" Amsterdam to Seoul via Istanbul. I'm a Turkish Airlines Elite Plus (Platinum) member for the past 5 years. Turkish Airlines used to be great compared to most airlines with great service and amazing food. Unfortunately things have changed for the worse and in the past year or two their level has dropped down quite dramatically and I am now starting to look to change and stop flying with Turkish Airlines. Business class food used to be amazing, it used to rival Qatar Airways and some first class food in other airlines. Food level has dropped to the ground and is average minus compared to many other airlines. I have spoken to quite a few cabin chiefs and they all confirm that many passengers are complaining about the deterioration in their business class food and that management is aware of this problem. Quite sad. Business class seats are relatively aged compared to the better airlines. While other airlines have moved forward, Turkish has stayed behind. There is no privacy, and the configuration is an outdated 2-3-2 (B777) - I assume this won't be changing as it very expensive to change seat configuration. It seems like prices are constantly going up and while Turkish used to compete with the likes of Swiss or Lufthansa, prices these days are typically higher on Turkish Airlines. Service on board is mostly good with the onboard staff mostly very friendly and caring. Airplane age can be a hit or a miss with some very old and some reasonably new. In flight entertainment is typically pretty good.",Passive
" Boston to Toronto and then Toronto to Istanbul to Kathmandu, all booked as a single ticket via Turkish airlines. As soon as I arrived to my connecting flight with AQir Canada for check in, they told me I could not board the flight because I did not have a visa. I told them I did not intend to stay in Canada but just transit and usually the transit visa is given at the airport or online. However, the staff told me that as a Nepal citizen I could only get the visa if I go to the consulate in New York and do the necessary paperwork. Worried I decided to contact the Turkish airlines customer service. I called about 20 times with no avail. The call kept going to an automatic response. Really worried I decided to go to terminal E to meet the Turkish airlines staff in person. To my surprise, no one was there. I contacted the help desk and they told me that the Turkish airlines staff will be there only after 7 pm but my flight was to leave at 5 pm. Desperately looking for options, I went around the airport talking to every staff I came across, explaining my situation and they all told me only the (non-existent) Turkish staff could help me. Fast forward to 7 pm, (already forced to meet miss my actual flight) I finally meet the ticketing staff of Turkish airlines. I explained her my situation and tell her how I am a student planning to go home and I have already brought a connecting domestic flight back in Nepal to go from Kathmandu to home and that if I did not make this flight I would lose that ticket too. Then all she does is to tell me that I should have known that Canada requires a visa and that it is my fault. Stunned at her response, I tried to reason with her about how it is unreasonable to expect the customer to know this beforehand and that it is the airlines responsibility to let the customer know of such peculiar cases. After discussing for several minutes, she tells me that there is another flight leaving directly from Boston to Istanbul and that there is only one seat left and it will cost me USD 691 to transfer to this flight. Also she told me that if I had called the customer service immediately after this happened and changed the flight, I would not have had to pay the fine. (which is odd because my customer service call was never answered). I felt betrayed and sad at how the people who are supposed to help you make your life miserable. Although the hospitality of the staff in the plane was good, I felt deeply unsatisfied because of what I had to go through. This is easily the worst travel experience of my life yet.",Detractor
" The ground staff were very nice and polite. However, the flight was slightly delayed and for 35 wheelchair passengers there were only 5 people to push them, slowing the boarding process even more at Pearson. The lines were chaos during boarding at Pearson. People did not even stay in systematic lines and they were just ""hogging"" to board like a crowd and the ground staff didn't do anything about it. But thankfully they could announce star alliance gold and business passengers first. At least I could get a lot of space to put my bag. The inflight service was excellent. Excellent selection of movies for a 10 hour flight to Istanbul, delicious and well-presented food, clean bathrooms and prompt staff. When my inflight entertainment system froze during the flight, a flight crew promptly responded and fixed it. Same with when I asked for tea mid-flight. However, the wifi was really bad, it didn't work at all. The cabin crew were very friendly. The same applies with the connecting inflight service till Mumbai. However, the boarding was a lot better at Istanbul, as we could thankfully board from the aerobridge than the bus.

I was flying from Dusseldorf to Mumbai, they cancelled the first leg of my ticket from Dusseldorf to Istanbul without my consent or without informing me. I spent 9 hours and heaven knows how much money in calling up their customer service before the day of the journey in getting this sorted and getting the ticket re-issued. The in-flight services were very poor, poor in-flight entertainment, cabin crew was rude and food was awful (on one of my 4 flights they served only meal which was non-veg and insisted that one has to pre-book ""special meals""). Any international flight has and should have at least two choices of meals - veg and non-veg. I am surprised how fast this airline has deteriorated after being a great one for a few years.

" Los Angeles to Tehran via Istanbul. Unfortunately this airline is getting worse and worse by the day. They used to be good in service and food. They served us cold and tasteless food although they have 1-2 chefs walking around. Their seats are narrow, cramped and very uncomfortable. If the passenger in front of you recline his/her seat, you can't use the tray in front of you. The space is too cramped. The bathrooms are filthy after a few hours and it is not really the flight attendants job to clean the bathrooms while serving the food with the same gloves. The flights from Istanbul to Tehran in both directions were terrible. The flight attendants were condescending to the fellow passengers. It wasn't just this trip. It is also the only airline flying to US has the longest immigration checkpoints before boarding the plane. 3 people checks your passport and 1 checks your carry-on. Everyone gets checked.",Detractor
 Istanbul to Lisbon. My family and I arrived 3 hours before the flight in order to check in and deliver our luggage. The assistant at the desk told us we couldn't get seats and his only explanation was â€˜this flight is horrible' and refused to give any further explanation. He gave us â€˜standby' boarding passes. At the boarding gate we were put aside and made wait for everyone else to get on board. There were 7 people in our situation and among them a pregnant lady that was treated with absolutely no respect! Since there was no one giving up the flight we had to stay and fly on the next day because we were sold tickets that didn't exist. We had bought this reservation for more than a month before the flight and suddenly they tell us there is no place for us? A Company has to make sure everyone is seated and flies at the time and date they reserved. Overbooking generates a lot of serious consequences.,Detractor

They end up giving me a middle seat, very narrow cramped seat between two athletic gentlemen that I could not move for 14 hours.

" I recently flew Turkish Airlines (to/from South Africa via Istanbul), and upon boarding my return flight Johannesburg to Houston via Istanbul and due to their gate security not recognizing my paperwork, I was denied entry onto my flight. Okay, so besides legalities as far as letting me on board even though USCIS confirmed my correct paperwork and Turkish Airlines refused to let me speak to a supervisor. I was treated horrifically, both by their ground staff and corporate office. No one knew who the hell to speak to as far as how their own offices, gates, officers etc worked. I was told I would be taken to the Turkish Airlines Lounge where I would have a computer and phone I could use and gather my thoughts and help, no. I was taken from one gate to the next for several hours, then taken in by security and held there for the next several hours. I was then told I had to go to the denied office and I would be assisted there, to which no assistance was available. They literally said when I asked if they knew who I could contact, â€œthere is a phone and computer, google your help.â€ I arrived at 5am, and left the airport that evening at 10:45pm after no help from Turkish Airlines. When I asked instead of being held here in Turkey if they would fly me back to South Africa they said no. I tried to ask about booking a flight to Germany where my other citizenship is, and they told me they would not let me because my end destination was in the United States. I then worked on trying to get accommodation close by, after being in the airport for a day and half, coffee shop for a day/night as I had no where to go and then finally find accommodation. Finally when gathering my paperwork, Turkish airlines then refused to even honor the ticket they denied me entrance on, so I had to find an extra $600, post $575 I had paid to get an interview with the Embassy, and accommodation costs, as a part-time student, they simply emailed me with the audacity of speaking to me like an incompetent person.

" Dubai to Hanover via Istanbul. I had a very short connection to begin with (70 minutes). When we reached Istanbul, the plane taxied away and a bus brought us to the terminal.

Next the international transfer security check was overwhelmed with passengers. I tried talking to the staff to let me go first but they said stay where you are in the lane - all passengers say that same things to go first. As a result I missed my connection. I went to the transfer desk for Turkish Airline. The lady said he will get me fixed on the next flight that leaves in three hours. She said I should wait while she gets a new boarding pass.

After 3 hours - a gentleman from Turkish Airways told me that it was my fault that I missed the connection. 1 hour was more than enough to get the connection.

" Taipei via Istanbul to Bremen with Turkish Airlines. It was probably the worst flight experience I had. The flight was supposed to leave late at night and the staff kept delaying it due to a technical reason in half an hour steps until about 4 am (6 hours late). I talked to a woman who flew the same route to Bremen and got upgraded to business class. Due to the delay I missed my connection in Istanbul and had to deal with the rudest customer service who wanted to give me a flight the next day (which was already my birthday that I tried to get home for in time) after lining up with several other passengers even though the airline knew for 15 hours that I would not be able to make my connecting flight. Only after arguing and looking up different options myself they booked me on a different flight to Bremen via Frankfurt. The rest of the waiting time in Istanbul i just felt terrible because no one should be mistreated by such customer service after the airline messed up on several ends already. But it gets worse! After finally arriving at Bremen airport with a total delay of 10 hours the airline confirmed that their customer service can be even worse. I wrote a feedback about my whole trip and how bad their staff handled the situation and asked why some passengers get a business class upgrade and some don't. I also applied to the passenger rights posted on their website where in my case they offered 600â‚¬ compensation. I cannot tell the emails in detail but it went on for 3 months and they just kept trying to find excuses. First of all they claimed that the delay has been beyond their control. At the gate it said the delay was due to technical reason (I even sent a picture as proof) which is not beyond an airlines control. About the rude customer service and delay policy they didn't really say anything besides offering to pay for my coffee in Istanbul. This confirmed to me that they just don't care about their customers. And finally, they said there has been no passenger upgraded on the flight. These are just some parts of the argument I had with Turkish airlines over the last three months. They don't stick to their promises and they have no interest in providing you a good travel experience. They don't even stick to their compensation policy posted on their website. Things can go wrong, that's just how it is. But how Turkish Airlines handles a situation like this really shows what you get with this airline. I thought never again but had one more flight with them from Bremen to Cairo via Istanbul in April. The flight got cancelled after boarding the plane and I arrived in Istanbul 9 hours late. Then planned sightseeing tour couldn't be done anymore and the hotel was booked for nothing. As I already expected, I had to deal with Turkish Airlines ground staff in Istanbul again.

My check-in was processed by an agent who was abrupt and surly who conversed with a colleague throughout the check-in process. At the gate we were told there was a 30 minute delay although none of the monitors showed it. As with most departures in China boarding was chaotic with priority lanes being used by all passengers. The flight took off 2.5 hours late despite the gate agents insistence that the delay was only for 30 minutes. On board the crew were friendly and professional. The seat was OK in upright position but uncomfortable in lie flat position due to worn out cushion. Food was tasty but the wine list is in need of a refresh as they have been serving the same selection for 2 years. IFE has a good selection but I opted for sleep given the very late departure time. Lavatories were in decent shape but the sink could have used a bit more attention. Due to late departure, the flight landed late resulting in many missed connections. Although the delay was not really the airline's fault as Beijing was having a late winter snowfall, the communications around it were totally misleading. For instance the captain referred to de-icing being completed in 5 minutes' time when no de-icing equipment were in sight. Overall it was a mediocre to OK flight.",Passive

" Boston to Tehran via Istanbul. I had one of my worst experience (if not the worst) with Turkish Airlines. I would be a couple pages if I write exactly how many mistakes their agents made and how I got ripped off because of their mistakes! When I first checked in my bag the agent couldn't find my second flight so didn't issue me the boarding pass for that flight and told me I should get boarding pass when I arrive in Istanbul. She first said I should claim my bag in Istanbul and then changed it and said I should claim it in my final destination. In Istanbul, I was told by an agent to wait in a line for boarding pass and when I reached front desk the person there said she couldn't find my ticket! Again, after I showed my online booking she said that because my flight is from the other airport I should go there and get my boarding pass! I then rushed to the other airport which is around 1-2 hours drive far (because I waited around 3 hours in that line to get my boarding pass!!) only to find out that my bag was left at the previous airport that I arrived! So I missed my flight, had to pay to reschedule fee, and had to go back to the previous airport to claim my bag. I told them that I don't want to reschedule with them and she said if I don't I basically forfeit my return flight! So, I had to pay a fee that was about 10 times higher than a single other flight that I could book at the same time with another airline! Back in the first airline, also I had so hard time to find my bag! Noone at this airlines knows what they are doing apparently. It's totally crazy. When I claimed my bag it was obvious that they made a mistake. They ripped off a part of it and wrote the destination by hand (took pictures of that as well to file a complaint). Not to mention that I got ripped off also by the airport taxi for 20 times of what I should have paid them (as I was in a hurry and didn't know the exchange rate and wanted not to miss my other flight although I had already missed it as my bag was not there). This is one of the worst and incompetent airlines that I traveled with. The only scenario that I can think of that you will have a pleasant flight is if nothing and absolutely nothing wrong or just a bit uncommon happens. Nobody knows what they are doing and it's surprising. Even when I wanted to find my bag at the previous airport when I went there, I talked to at least 5 Turkish Airlines agent about it and everyone was sending me to a different direction and was saying a different thing.

" New York to Tel Aviv via Istanbul was on time, as were 4 segments of my itinerary. Cabin staff solicitous ,helpful and polite. Catering out of JFK was particularly good, the onboard ""chefs"" a nice touch even if they really aren't preparing much fresh food. We were seated on the side, 2 abreast, which was good as the center section of 3 across does not look appealing. The seats are relatively open, not affording much privacy, but the amount of storage is more than very sufficient, and the seat comfort when in the flat position, including the ""bedpad"", comforter and pillow more than adequate. The lounge in Istanbul was quite good, being on two levels with many interesting and well prepared food stations. We were also given two private sleeping rooms in the lounge for our 5 hour transit, a very nice touch.

" Mauritius to Dublin via Istanbul. I have flown Turkish Airlines a few times now in business. The business seats are side by side lie flats and not the more modern individual spaces found on most long-haul airlines. So, privacy is an issue. The chef in my opinion not a professionally trained chef but more a steward. The idea is a not a bad one as it gives the impression of a more dedicated service. However, the food is quite poor, and the drinks offered not a large selection. The staff were all very pleasant to me. Arriving at IST the business lounge, supposedly the best in the world, was closing. I arrived at 12.10 and the girl told me they were closed. I wrote to Turkish and after a large exchange of emails I gave up. They insisted it was open. I was there, it was closed!! Their website is a mess, their mobile site a disaster and their customer service appalling. They destroyed my new bag. I got the replacement quote and they offered me half. Why should they ask me to pay half towards a bag they wrecked? This has changed my attitude towards Turkish and they are not my chosen airline any longer.",Detractor

" Berlin to Kuala Lumpur via Istanbul. Check in at TXL was smooth. We were bussed to a A330 for the first leg to IST. The IFE screens were not working for half of the seats in the main cabin. Also not during the safety instructions and I was shocked to see that the cabin crew did not ensure passengers were given a demonstration instead or checked if seat belts were fastened and specific rows were cleared of hand luggage. The crew could also learn a bit more English and be a bit friendlier overall. IST-KUL was on a Boeing 777 and certainly more comfortable. The crew was more present, is TK a hit or miss? The IFE is great (when it works) and they certainly serve excellent food! IST is a nightmare but that's another review.",Promoter
" Mumbai to Houston via Istanbul. My bag was misplaced/lost by Turkish Airlines and it took more than one month to get my bag. The airline was not even interested in contacting me or updating me. I repeatedly explained to them that more than anything else, my important medications which I needed to take on a daily basis were in the bag. Fortunately, some of the medications, which my husband had in his possession, were couriered to me from New York. To cut a long story short, finally after my bag reached its destination, instead of the airline delivering the bag, I had to collect it from La Guardia airport. Turkish Airlines boasts of being the best airline in Europe but I do not agree to this. I am sure there are more passengers who must have faced similar problems that I went through.",Passive
" Don't be fooled by good food and new aircraft. Only when you face a problem you can see the quality of services. And I (Business class traveller and Elite Gold member) have a very long list of stories of very poor services. 1) 8 days today and I am without my only checked in bag during my flight to Houston and Turkish Airlines simply not doing anything except sending a message every few days saying they are investigating. I have no clothes for 8 days and Turkish Airlines are refusing even to compensate me for the lost bag. 2) When we changed our travel date due to a medical emergency supported by a letter from the hospital, Turkish Airlines charged me and my wife 1200 extra dollars per ticket and refused to waive any fees due to the medical emergency like all other reputable airlines. 3) On a number of occasions I missed my connections due to late arrival to Istanbul (on Turkish Airlines) and Turkish Airlines refused to take any resposibility for missing my meetings by flying me on a different airlines flight. This is happening to business class travellers, imagine if you fly economy. Very poor Airline.",Detractor
" Moscow to Manila via Istanbul. Good flight from Moscow to Istanbul. Comfortable seats with reasonable recline. Flight left and landed on time. Cabin staff functioned well with announcements in Turkish, Russian and English. A good lunch was served with appropriate sized portions. IFE had a fair selection of films available. Istanbul to Manila a fair flight. Dinner was served at the beginning of the flight and chef did not present any alternatives when the main course that I wanted was not available so I slept and woke up relatively early. I had an early breakfast (this was quite adequate, although I would have liked a little more given no dinner the previous night). No further food was offered. I think that the airline would be better off allowing passengers going straight to sleep and then having breakfast and lunch as the two meals on this long flight. Overall the quality of the service from Istanbul to Manila was a little lower than previous long haul flights in business class.",Promoter
 Istanbul to Tel Aviv return. Ground staff very helpful in boarding the flight. Both flights left and arrived on time. The planes were clean and modern and the flights uneventful.

On the return flight the check in worked well. I was given priority because I was transferring to Business Class for the second leg.

" Houston to Dubai via Istanbul. My nightmare started when I missed my connecting flight from Istanbul going to Dubai. I was sent from one person to another there after and subsequently had a buy a visa ($30) at the airport in other to get to their ticket counter. At the ticket counter, the guy at the booth told me I had to pay $600 penalty for missing my flight and then another $2000 for a new ticket because I bought my ticket from an agent. There was no talking to him after that as he dismissed me when I told him there was no way I could pay him $2600. With the help of a very kind gentleman at the airport, I purchased another ticket to Dubai with Air Arabia. I had to leave Ataturk airport via taxi ($60) to another airport called Sabiha to catch the flight to get to Sharjah International and then subsequently to Dubai. When I went online to check, I was told my return was valid and secured and I even called the customer service line twice and was informed that I was checked in for my return. I was able to check in online and even change my seat for the return flight. I arrived at DXB airport at 4am February 22nd morning, waited for the check in counter to open at 5:20am to check in, only to be told by the agent at the desk that I could not fly out with them. He told me that since I broke the sequence and did not pay the $2600 in Turkey, my ticket was no longer valid. He also told me that they had neither a customer service counter nor a ticket counter in Dubai so my only option was to call the same customer service that previously assured me that I was confirmed to fly back to Houston with their airline. I had to be back in Houston so I had no choice but to purchase another ticket with Emirates. I had to take a shuttle to terminal 3, bought a one way business class ticket for $5440 just to make it back to Houston. Telling a passenger to pay $2600 for missing a connection is unconscionable. The staff are rude and inhumane, Ataturk airport is chaotic and Turkish Airlines does not care about its passengers regardless of if you're flying business class or economy.",Detractor
" Houston to Istanbul. Very poor staff interaction, in both the aircraft and Istanbul airport, it's quite unenjoyable to be in such hostile environment.

I believe they used to be the best airlines in Europe, now I am confident to say they are the worst in Europe.",Detractor
 London to Istanbul. I am a frequent flyer who always travels with excess baggage up to 10 times a year internationally. As a result of the ultra punitive charges for excess baggage on the low cost carriers like Ryanair and EasyJet I prefer to travel with the normal carriers and was very keen to try Turkish Airlines as they have a good reputation and being a gold Emirates flyer I wanted to check the experience. How sad that they have such a horrific extra baggage policy. After battling to find anything on there site after booking my ticket I presumed that I would pay per piece and saw that there looked to be an $80 price on some flights. As I had already paid and unable to navigate there confusing baggage policy on line and unable to pay on line either I made my way to the airport. My ticket cost me approx Â£120 I went with 1 extra bag weighing exactly 23kg. I know how strict airlines are about this. I was horrified to be charged approx Â£230 for my extra bag. Â£110 more than my ticket and resulted in an increase in my costs by over 200%. I could have bought 2 extra tickets. How can this be justified? I immediately realized why there extra luggage policy on there website is difficult to navigate. Extra profits. Ryanair and Easyjet get such a bad rap for these sort of charges and they are open and upfront about them. To get stung with these at the airport and have them being double the cost of a ticket is truly blackmailing your customers. I learnt my lesson and will never travel this airline. Companies that force unjustified charges on unsuspecting customers should be held to account. Why is it so much? How can one bag cost double a ticket price? Shame on them.,Detractor

" Istanbul to Guangzhou. One of the nicer things about Turkish Airlines is the free possibility to reserve a flight for a couple of days before booking it. We did, because we had our 3 month old daughter with us and desperately wanted her to be able to sleep in a baby bassinet and were ready to book any airline that could offer that. After reserving the flight we contacted Turkish Airlines helpdesk on Twitter (@TK_HelpDesk) to ask if they could reserve a bassinet for us and confirmed the ticket and paid after we were assured that would not be a problem. All fell apart 40 days later when we actually got on the plane and there were no bassinet seats available and the plane looked like it was fully booked. The crew asked a couple of people of they would want to change, but all refused. Later we learned they paid extra for the seats with the bassinets. A 10 hour night flight turned into a sleepless horror story trying to keep the baby balanced on our laps for hours. The space was so limited we had no possibility to eat a thing and without any possibility for air to flow things got really sweaty. After recovery at home we contacted the complaints department and quickly learned that they were only there for empty apologies. Turkish Airlines apparently decided to start selling the seats with the bassinets and decided not to bother with any of its previous commitments, just deleted them all without message or warning. Kind of baffled I inquired a few times again but somehow this multi-billion company kept insisting that breaching the contract with their customers was business as usual for them. Can't really do anything else then to warn as many people as possible not to trust this airline.",Detractor
" Manchester to Kuala Lumpur via Istanbul. The first time I flew with Turkish Airlines and it was a disappointment. My flight from Manchester to Istanbul was delayed for an hour as some of the passengers could not follow simple instructions ie. seating at their assigned seats. This caused ruckus as some of them insisted on sitting on other people's seats which I found utterly ridiculous. The staff handled this poorly and kept shouting at everyone. The seat has narrow legroom and was uncomfortable. Even though it was a 4 hour flight to Istanbul, the plane was small and does not offer much space. There is only 2 toilets for economy class passengers and with people lining up to use the bathroom and staff trying to serve meals with the trolley, it was not a nice experiencel. The staff's English proficiency has room for improvement as I could not understand much from the announcements made and at one point I was given tomato juice after asking for mango juice. The in-flight meals and entertainment are satisfactory. I was lucky as even though the first flight was delayed for an hour, I managed to continue with the second flight to Kuala Lumpur. I however was not happy about the transit as the gate for my connecting flight was really far and then I had to ride the bus which took almost half an hour to reach the plane and was left to wait in the bus with the doors open (which was not a good idea as it was cold and windy early that morning) for another 15-20 mins before we were allowed to enter the plane. In conclusion, this was really a bad experience.",Detractor

" Tel Aviv to New York via Istanbul. Awful service on the Ground We had a family vacation, using Turkish airlines from Tel Aviv to JFK and then connecting with Copa. I won't comment on the flight or the service in the air, they were both great. But I was surprised at the ineptitude and lack of communication abilities of the ground crew, both in the Istanbul Lounge, and in the JFK transfer desk. My wife had the beginning of a cold on the plane and the eair pain was almost unbearable. Went to the Concierge at the Lounge to get some Ear Medicine, and they couldn't understand us. They sent us to the reception. Reception called the airport pharmacy, but couldn't manage to let them know what we needed. We waited for an hour for a pharmacist to show, and the liunge didn't care either way. They even complained that we should be grateful they were doing us a favor. Very dissapointed. But at JFK, it was even worse! We arrived after an 11 hour flight and had 6 hours to connect to Panama. We picked up our 8 large bags and 3 carryons, we go to the airline interline bag counter. The clueless agent they had, told us that they couldn't accept the bags. That Turkish only had an alliance with JetBlue and with United, not with Copa. We told her that our bags had been ticketed from Tel Aviv to Copa with a Turkish airlines bag locator, and she still ignored it. She insisted there was no alliance between Turkish and Copa. We explained they were both Star Alliance, and it was like she didn't know what that meant. A supervisor didn't want to come down to the desk, and said we had to go to Copa. The agent wouldn't even call the Copa desk to see if they were open. After 20 minutes arguing, we had to get 3 baggage carts, take the Airtrain to terminal 4, to find out the Copa counter wouldn't open for 3 more hors. We had to wait with the bags for 3 hours, having a bite to eat at a dinner. All because of Turkish Airlines incompetence, because obviously when we explained to the Copa supervisor what happened, they said Turkish should've accepted the bags.

Connecting in Istanbul was OK, very crowded and gate logistics not very efficient, but understandable due to the small terminal from where we were shuttled to the plane with a bus. We did not check our bags and the staff were vocal on giving priority to overhead compartment for larger bags which suited us perfectly, this is something other airlines should think of.

" Stockholm to Istanbul. Fast and friendly check-in agent. Time for a visit to the modest SAS Lounge (being Star Gold status) where there was a selection of light bites and drinks perfectly adequate for a pre-flight snack. Orderly boarding with priority boarding well handled. Inside the aircraft I first noticed the small size of the individual seat-back screens. But obviously airlines can't just throw them all away when bigger and better ones come along. Hot meal served in flight - with a choice of two entrees and various drinks. Delay landing in Istanbul due to congestion - hopefully a thing of the past when the new airport opens. Bus to the terminal. Long queue for the Biz class immigration desk. To the right of it is a channel serving a continual line of Turkish Airlines crew. I don't understand why the crew dont use the two adjacent but always empty Beogs electronic immigration gates, hence freeing up a second line for the high revenue fare paying passengers.

" At half the price for a return trip from Heathrow to Cape Town with other airlines, Turkish Airlines' business class offering was too tempting to pass by, even if there was the inconvenience of transiting via Istanbul Take-off for LHR to IST was delayed by an hour, which was a concern given that we had just 1 hr 40 minutes between the scheduled landing and take-off for the IST-CPT leg. Having the full flat-bed experience for a short-haul flight was a real luxury and Turkish Airlines win hands down for providing this. Food on board was adequate and of the standard that BA now provide in Club Europe. Wheeling a trolley around loaded with foil-topped main courses didn't seem the best way of using the sky chef on board. Landing at IST was delayed by congestion and we'd almost given up on making the next flight. Getting to the terminal was helped by the airline providing a separate bus for business class. Details of gates for transit passengers was helpfully provided on board. IST is unbelievably chaotic, even at 1:00 am, but staff were around to direct passengers, and it was then just a matter of a frantic dash to the gate. Amazingly, we arrived just in time for boarding, but there was then another wait for the bus to fill to take us to a far stand. The food service on the IST-CPT leg was astonishingly good, and the role of sky chef was much more in evidence, with individual plating up of all the courses and a trolley circulated with desserts. A breakfast menu was also offered just after boarding, which allowed us to choose as much or as little as we wanted. Even the scrambled eggs were good!

Fully flat bed seats were comfortable but food service was disorganized. Very pleasant staff was running back and forth with individual dishes and glasses in very inefficient fashion. The major problem for us occurred in the Istanbul business class lounge.

After complaining to manager, we were offered an accommodation in an outside hotel (we would need to procure visa and arrange transportation). Before our departure from Canada I inquired by phone if we can reserve the sleeping space because of our long wait and was told that is on first come first served and no mention of the rule. Would we know that there was the stupid rule we would have reserved a hotel room within the airport. On our arrival in Istanbul it was of course fully booked.

I'd booked an overnight connexion in Istanbul because the fare was $100 less than the other carriers. My hotel was $50, so it was still a savings. However, I checked TIMATIC for visa requirements on a star alliance site and it said no visa required, but I had to pay $30 at the airport to leave to go to my hotel. So, it turned out to be a false economy. Check-in service at both AMS and IST were top-notch: I had a connexion at JFK to Jet blue to Albuquerque and was very happy that TK interlined my bag to them. US carriers have stopped doing that an American Airlines doesn't even transfer bags to their own flights anymore (if booked on a separate record, which is how you issue two tickets since it has become a self-service world).

I was bit disappointed with the special meal as they have been serving the same food for more than a year now. Starter was great so was the main course. I am surprised to see that they have cut down on dessert. I had some desserts and they were delicious. The cabin was very quiet and could catch some sleep. Pre landing hot meal was also delicious. The best part of the whole flight was the crew who worked very hard to ensure each passenger was happy. In short TK has excellent product, catering is very healthy and plenty to choose from.

The in flight entertainment did not work in row 5, it was a full flight, so to be without for 12 hours was a nightmare, staff just shrugged shoulders. Case arrived broken in Munich - Delsey Hard Case, that was wrapped so did not see until unpacking. So would I use again, well 70% as price was keen.",Passive
" Ä°stanbul to Antalya. Check-in and boarding smooth. Plane was clean and seats were comfortable. Staff was polite enough. About 20 minutes after the take off, they served a sandwich and a cup of drink that you chose from given options. Though I think food should sold with a separate option instead of being included to every ticket, it was delicious so no complaints there. Overall everything was good. I had bad experiences with Turkish Airlines but this time I am satisfied.",Promoter
" My family and I flew from Washington via Islamabad and return from Karachi - Istanbul - Washington in December on Turkish Airlines and couldn't have been more pleased. The flights were on time, inflight catering was excellent, the leg space in economy has slightly improved, the English proficiency of the crew has greatly improved, and the inflight entertainment has vastly improved and is easy to use. The service of the crew was excellent. My mother in law who was traveling with us can only consume liquids and requested if she could could get some milk to drink. Instead the crew brought her soup from business class and then came back a little bit later with some more. Truly above and beyond service on their part. The only thing though is the USB ports did not fully work in all of the seats which was annoying, and I wish they did not do away with the delicious Turkish food which used to be served. But all in all Turkish Airlines is worth every penny, and I do not regret choosing them back in 2007 as my international airline of choice.",Promoter
" Munich to Tehran via Istanbul SAW. I had a suitcase and a carry on. As the carry on exceeded the 8 kilos permitted cabin weight, I paid the extra fee and checked in the carry on as well. However, when landed in Tehran, I realized that the carry on's tagging number was not even issued at the boarding desk and my carry on was lost. I filled in the application form at lost and found office in Tehran and have called the Turkish airlines at Munich airport several times so far, but after 10 days still haven't received any answer. As I do not even have a baggage tag number for my carry on, I cannot even claim for compensation. What I am wondering is, even if the check-in clerk forgets to hand over the baggage tag, why can't they try to check what was the number of the checked in carry-on as all the information are recorded and kept in the system. I am extremely disappointed as this has kind of ruined my holiday.",Detractor

Not only did I have to keep asking for utensils and missing food items on my tray but when I asked for a drink he gave e me a tiny cup and poured it half way with a coca-cola beverage.

I was not given a seat for free, I paid for it.",Detractor
" It was my first time flying Turkish Airlines from Geneva to Jakarta via Istanbul. I picked them because the schedule was convenient, and they were a bit cheaper than Emirates. The first leg was fine, nothing special, but not much to comment or criticize. The service was acceptable, and the food actually pretty good. Transit in Istanbul: disembarked in the rain, had to take the bus from a remote parking spot, same thing outbound, got a bit wet both times. Ataturk is not a great airport to say the least, and is one of the reasons I would not pick Turkish Airlines for first choice: facilities below average, security is a bit of a jungle, the gate was way too far from the lounge, the boarding was a single line (everyone mixed), too many people cramped in the bus. I was tired, had come out of a sleepless night, and going for a second one, so all this extra stress and exercise was not welcome at all. I had bought a business class ticket, just to prevent being too tired! The second leg was less impressive than the first one, the cabin service was below average for business, the staff were trying, but were missing something. I slept through dinner, but the arrival snack was disappointing (scrambled eggs at 4.00 pm! Or a Turkish pastry that the staff don't even bother explaining what it is, so I passed. I had a hard time having a tea served the way I wanted, so I gave up on it. The seat was acceptable, and the entertainment system good (some other airlines have more choices, but it was good enough for me), I liked the controlller than can be used as a screen, and the headsets. I could have taken Emirates for $500 more.",Passive

Since our flight was delayed by an hour or so, we couldn't get a ramp, so we waited for the buses to come so that they can bring passengers to the Terminal. I was traveling with a wheelchair, was sitting in the middle of the plane. After all the passengers got off the plane, they starts the wheelchair passengers. First they moved us all to the front of the plane then said that we're getting off the back door. We waited another 30 mins to get off.",Detractor

" Medina to Lahore via Istanbul. Turkish Airlines service is one of the poorest. I and my wife were made to sit at the airport during a 14 hours stopover at IST on 4th December. To add insult to injury, 2 of 3 baggage pieces remain missing to date. Our transit time at IST was around 14 hrs. When approached the service counter at Istanbul they gave us only one snack (one slice of pizza for each passenger) voucher. I asked her where to stay for full day transit. She said anywhere at the airport and went back to her mobile phone chat. In between, she was chatting with a male colleague and didn't seem to have time to pay attention to customer. She worked more like a machine than a human in only giving vouchers with out speaking to customers. Upon complaint they tried to cover its inefficiency and poor service by saying that â€œNo request can be traced at their hotel desk on ISTâ€. How will there be a record if TK staff misleads the customers away. Nobody (TK ticket sales office at Lahore airport) had informed us the time of ticketing to request a hotel in advance during transit at IST. TK said that we didn't request a hotel.",Detractor

In Istanbul 3 different employees of Turkish tried to convince me that that was the correct one and no change could be done, despite the fact earlier flights were available. Customer service was unwelcoming, poor and inefficient. Istanbul airport is small, dirty and congested. They sell lower cost tickets, just because you have to wait for up to 10 hours in the airport. Be prepared to be misstreated. It seems that rudness is a part of Turkish Airline culture.",Detractor
" Turkish Airlines in the last few years have been a formidable competitor to European long haul carriers. And quite rightly so. Not only are their prices extremely competitive, book early and you could be in for a bargain. This was my first long haul flight with them, and it will not be my last. They operate on A330 with 2x2x2 and Boeing 777 with a 2x3x2 layout. While the seating configuration was as expected, it's the service that made all the difference. Once on board, they have a rather novel safety video, which is both informative and amusing. The 'onboard chef' is a nice added touch, although it's not like he's going to prepare the meal in front of you. The flight attendants were extremely polite and friendly, regularly checking up on you if you needed anything. The dining was great. With a mini 'candlelight' to compliment the food table, to a delicious selection of appetisers and sweet trolley, the service was excellent without being rushed. The amenity kits were rather basic. The IFE was good on the outbound A330 and 777. With some nice wine, cognac and coffee later, the bed was prepared for me and tucked myself in for a good 3 hours sleep. The outbound flight to Hanoi was near perfection. The flight from Hanoi to Istanbul was a slight disappointment. I first noticed the A330 had the old livery on it. When entering, the cabin looked older, there was no storage space, other than overhead. The seats looked old and felt uncomfortable. The IFE, with the small handset was so difficult to use, even the cabin stall were trying to help others with it. The flight announcements were crackled and weren't clear. The toilet I used, although clean was old - the flush button was held together with duct tape! The flight from Istanbul to London on the 777 was a delight. This was a long haul business class experience on a short haul flight. The service and cabin staff were excellent, even on the old A330!",Promoter
" Having been on a few European flights so called 'Business Class', I was looking forward to the much praised Turkish Airlines Business Class flying from London to Istanbul. Turkish use widebody on most flights to Istanbul, and I was aware that this narrow body aircraft which I was flying in was not going to be as spacious. But the moment I stepped into the aircraft, I was welcomed with a warm smile and directed to my seat. This was a true Business Class seat (unlike the notorious tight 2x2 with empty middle seat deployed by other European airlines). The wide seat was extremely comfortable, with ample leg room, reading lamp and fold out IFE monitor. No sooner had I settled down, I was offered a selection of soft drinks followed by hot towel. 20 minutes into the flight I chose a traditional Turkish breakfast which included a selection of delicious appetizers, accompanied by Champagne (with refills). The flight attendants were efficient, chatty without being intrusive, and looked like they actually enjoyed serving the passengers. I fiddled about a little with the IFE, watched about half a movie, downing my coffee. Although not a great choice of films and programmes, it was perfectly adequate for a short journey. I enjoyed this flight very much and full marks to Turkish Airlines offering a good business class product on a short haul flight. If they decided to add WiFi on all aircraft, it might really annoy the competition.",Promoter

Seating slightly cramped in Economy but fine for 2Â½ hr flights and all seats equipped with IFE. TK seems to have kept their high quality in catering (Do & Co): full hot meals provided with drinks, very tasty meals. The cabin crews were hard working on both flights and the lady purser on TK1761 was a real star: very warm, friendly and extremely patient with the same unruly passengers who jumped up to the aisle every time the seat belt sign went on in heavy turbulence.

" Flew business class, TK35 Istanbul to Montreal on Dec 08 2017. I must emphasize the amazing lounge in Istanbul. No wonder it was voted the best business class lounge in the world by Skytrax. We were a bit deceived though, not to be able to have a suite to relax, since our layover was 30 minutes above the 7 hours permitted as per regulations! At least we were able to use the showers after 2.5 hours on a waiting list. Best shower facilities we have ever seen in an airport business class lounge! Onboard, before take-off they offer a selection of newspapers and magazines but nothing in French! Isn't Turkish Airlines aware that Montreal is the second largest French metropolis in the world, after Paris? Just as an example, Lufthansa flies to Montreal out of Frankfurt and Munich, their safety announcements are in German, French with English subtitles. Being respectful about these issues goes a long way. Nevertheless, the crew were professional and quite nice. The business class cabin is quite impressive! Lot's of leg room, very comfortable seats, very large screens, quality headphones. I was able to sleep for 5 hours, which is out of the ordinary on board an aircraft for me. The food was ok, very well presented. We like these candlelight dinners which no other airlines offers to our knowledge. The negative side to this trip though is that we constantly had to beg for a glass of wine. We had just flown on Thai and Singapore and right after you sit down before take-off, they come to offer Champagne, water and juice. Not so with Turkish, they only offer a selection of 4 types of lemonade. When they take your meal order they ask if you want a glass of wine with your main course. No cocktail whatsoever before the meal is offered. If you dare ask for a glass of wine it is secretly poured behind a counter in front of the cabin. Normally with other airlines, they come to your seat and show you the bottle before they pour into your glass. You even have to tell them at some point to stop, because they offer constantly. Not so on Turkish!",Promoter
" Kayseri to Istanbul. I cannot recommend this airline. After being unable to fly to Turkey due to recent US Visa restrictions, I called the company. Was told to call back two weeks later which I did and then I was told to call back again. I did. Then I was told that I must get a refund at a Turkish Airlines sales office, there are only 2 in the entire US. I complained and was told to call back. Now I am told that I can get a ""refund"" after cancellation and ""no-show"" fees are applied. This amounted to $32 euros on a $600 ticket. Apparently, they are only granting full refunds if you depart from the US. This is an absolute sham and seems set up to make the system frustrating to navigate so they can mitigate their losses.

" Dubai to Toronto via Istanbul. My wife encountered a problem in Istanbul that involved an airport transit visa through Canada. It took about 8 hours of our time at 5 different airport locations to eventually buy new tickets to get back the next day. Our original tickets say: â€œReissue With 200 USD penalty. What I didn't see was the fine print at the bottom: â€œTurkish Airlines reserves the right to change rules regarding ticket changes and refunds.â€. They mean it. As bad as our personal experience was, the real reason we are so appalled is that we were there long enough to see this is the norm for them. In our single day there, we saw at least 100 other travelers going through similar things. The only solution ever offered is to purchase another ticket. We witnessed several people weeping. Many losing control and shouting. Their own personnel were screaming at customers (in a separate office area though, it was all yucks and laughing). We were lucky because we had the means to purchase new tickets. Others clearly didn't. I don't know what happened to some of them. One moment was very symbolic of the entire experience. Another vanquished traveler was paying $843 for a new ticket with cash. He handed an employee $845 but she of course had no change. Instead of the $5, he gave her two $1 bills. I had one in my pocket so gave it to her as well. She held my $1 bill up and pointed to the corner which had a very small piece torn off, no ink was missing, and sneered â€œI can't accept thisâ€. She did this simply because she could. We were powerless. She knew it and reveled in it. I usually only add reviews if they're positive. I understand people and businesses can have a bad day. Turkish Airlines is different. This is truly a horrible company with mean spirited employees.",Detractor

" My first flights (Jakarta to Antalya via Istanbul). On the homebound flight from Antalya to Jakarta via Istanbul my TK 2425 (30 Nov 2017) was delayed without any announcement. On boarding I asked the ground crew if I would still be able to catch my Istanbul-Jakarta flight (TK56), and the ground crew replied that ""no problem"". The plane landed late and I missed my flight to Jakarta. Yes, Turkish airline did give me a hotel, yes, Turkish airline did give me a ticket rebooking, yes Turkish airline did give me breakfast-lunch-dinner. However, I did not receive my luggage and hence I did not have any change of clothes. Upon seeing the queue at the Turkish Airlines hotel transfer I was in a dilemma of either waiting another 2 hours before getting my luggage at 4am or go sleep at the hotel and not have my luggage. In my luggage was also my laptop charger and mobile charger which I would have needed to inform work, arrangements that I will be delayed by one day. But more scarily was my box of medicines that I needed. I was appalled by the ground crew at Antalya airport who lied to my face, and the ground crew at the hotel transfer who did not sympathize that I needed my luggage and only offered strict options. I was very dissapointed that Turkish airline did not provide me a letter of delay to help me justify my situation at my home country, and no laundry service hence I was not in fresh clothes for more than 48hrs!

" Being a loyal customer of this airline, I was once again dissapointed with Turkish Airlines completely messing up my flight. Outbound flight TK1856 from Barcelona to Istanbul left about 40 minutes delayed, and for that reason we were denied boarding for our connecting flight to Moscow, which resulted in spending an entire night at the airline's lounge. I would like to particularly stress the utter rudeness of the airline staff at the airport, who are completely uninterested in helping you out, pretending not to speak English and watching videos on their smartphones, giggling and discussing it with each other. While at the lounge, you are not allowed to use a shower since the previous flight was less than 8 hours long. So please know, if you miss your flight due to the airline's fault, you are on your own and no one really cares about your problem. That's a fact. The same situation happened to me in April, while returning from Miami to Moscow via Istanbul. The airline representative failed to change the dates for my wife and my infant child, changing it only for me, therefore, I ended up paying for the completely new tickets. Overpaid around 2000 USD. And, once again, the flight left late from Miami and, therefore, we missed the connecting flight and spent the night at the airport. We were not offered any hotel and we were also denied access to the lounge due to the mess up with the airline. The airline's feedback form is awful, and up to this day my issues with them had not been resolved. Even visiting the airline's office in Moscow does not help, everything is managed through the website. Overall, I am very disappointed with the airline and especially with their customer care. It's a shame, since their planes and prices are very nice, the headache in dealing with the problems afterwards is just too much to fly with them again.",Detractor

Prior to boarding, used the lounge which was operating at a lower pace than usual and the food choices were not as plentiful as they are during regular hours. Boarding was by zones but it was a total disappointment when I found out we were being bussed to the plane which made the use of zones completely redundant. On board, the aircraft looked newish with 2x2x2 configuration in business class. The FA's were pleasant, friendly and professional in the conduct of their duties although they did not intervene when the passenger behind me stood up while the aircraft was taxiing. We were served breakfast then lunch prior to landing but the service was a tad on the slow side. I completed 8 return journeys across the Atlantic with Turkish in the last 12 months and their menu and wine selection have been the same each time and I believe a change is long overdue.

Their airplanes are clean, the services offered (entertainment, catering) above average and their crew on the longer, second leg of my trip was fine as well. Unfortunately my new bag didn't arrive in Singapore. It's missing to this very day. The airport luggage handlers in Singapore created a lost baggage report form for me. They called me for four days, every day, to update me that my bag is not yet located. Then they stopped. Turkish Airline's website claims ""Within the first 5 days, the search for lost baggage is the responsibility of the airport Lost and Found Office. If your baggage is not found within the first 5 days, please visit the baggage irregularity report and follow-up page and make a claim with the required documents."". So I did that. I went to their website and made the claim. The website feels like it's 1990 again, limits text fields to something like 255 (not sure anymore) characters and disables copy and paste. It's as bad a website as I've ever seen one and will send you an English confirmation mail that links you to their Turkish website. I filed claims, stated my case, provided invoices and brands/prices for the things I am missing . Within minutes I received a reply. Unfortunately it didn't state a thing, was quite possibly a canned message and had vague content like ""On the other hand, if our research brings any negative result, then",Detractor
"  Atlanta to Nairobi via Istanbul. My experience begun with trying to book a reservation on the company portal on 4th November currently having a choice of 2 systems. Between dodging the prompt on whether you want to use â€œold versionâ€ or â€œnew versionâ€ I struggled to reserve a round trip from Atlanta to Nairobi 19th November 7, 2017 return 27th December 2017 only to discover minutes later when going to print off ticket that it was wrong! The information was captured inaccurately, I just had one way ticket that was outbound with my return date on it. Confident that this is an easy fix after years of travelling with other gulf region airlines, I immediately reach out to the Sales Office in Atlanta which rings endlessly without any answers. Very surprised but again in good faith reached out to the call center number provided. This was a nightmare, the first agent could barely speak English and any attempt to get the name was met with callous response of â€“ why are you calling. Speaking very slowly and clearly as it was obvious there was minimal comprehension, agent also confirming he could not understand leaving me very confused I patiently informed of the situation explaining that I was looking for a round trip ticket but believed there was a technical issue as screens kept switching between 2 versions on the portal. Eventually I was transferred to another department which I was informed would resolve the issue and unprofessionally transferred. I had to go through the same process. On the 6th when calling in for a status, as I tried to review the issue to the first agent, she told me she doesn't have to talk to me if I was calling for a status and I had to persist that she could not treat customers that way. This was the first time ever to attempt to use Turkish Airline and it is quite a rude shock. Eventually I was transferred to another department to an incoherent agent who sarcastically informed me that I could call back to speak to a more articulate agent. Not believing a corporation like this does not have people who could comprehend the issue, I made another attempt to call back and request to speak with a manager and explain that I needed a resolution with my primary goal is to get the correct ticket that I reserved as I still intended to take the trip. I persevered the same call process all over again and this time found an agent, more coherent and a little patient only for him to tell me they had emailed me a response and that my request was denied. When I sought for clarification or a manager he informed me that there are no managers there and he read a script out. This is very disturbing, there's no professional etiquette to this cycle of events even more so, my issue has not been addressed. It seems to be more about the money than customer satisfaction. My trip is about 50 hours away but I have the wrong ticket and no resolve. I have never experienced such a service in my many years of travel. I am hoping management will actually resolve the issue and not just respond without addressing the concern. I shudder at the thought of what lays ahead in the flight if this is the type of service they have before you even travel.",Detractor
"  Very good experience in total! Extremely good seats from Copenhagen to Istanbul. When entering the plane we saw that it was 2+2 seats with good space and an IFE even if it was only a 2.50 hr flight. Was served a simple meal which was enough. Had a layover of 3.15 hr in Istanbul and went to the lounge. From all reviews the lounge was highlighted as something positive. I would say the lounge needs a refresh. Worn seats, crowded, closed food places, etc.. Not at all what I had in my mind. You could of course drink unlimited liquor. Istanbul to Antananarivo was the best Business travel ever. Very responsive personnel and called you by name. The IFE had a good selection but the Denom headset was not noice cancelling! The boarding was chaotic. No organisation whatsoever. Would I travel with them again - Yes!",Promoter

The lights were turned off very late although it is a night flight. The same problem happened when breakfast was served and many pax did the same after they finished their breakfast.",Passive
"  Istanbul to London. My comment is really on the ground experience rather than the flight itself. There is no transport from the lounge to the gate for lesser abled people. All they offer is booking a wheelchair. How are you supposed to push somebody in a wheelchair while also carrying two handbags, a trolley and a guitar. Other airports/airlines have buggies at their disposal. Considering that some gates are 15 minutes walk, this is pretty poor. When flying from an apron gate (7xx e.g. 700), there are no business class buses for business class travelers and you're expected to stand in the bus for 20 minutes or so while it fills up until people step onto each others toes and everybody is squashed in. When questioning the ground staff on why there is no business class bus unlike like we were told at check-in, they said 'economics' and that business class buses are only available for incoming and domestic flights - very poor show. My overall rating of 6 explained: - on-board service & food: 8 - on-board cleanliness of toilets: 5 (floor's often wet) - lounge services & food: 8 - male lounge staff: 5 (often loud or shouting across the room) - female lounge staff: 9 - ground services (bus/transport): 0",Passive
"  Toronto to Tehran via Istanbul. This flight and airport was the worst travel experience we had. The flight from Toronto to Istanbul departed the Pearson Airport with one hour delay. There was very unusual turbulence, almost through more than half the flight time from Toronto to Istanbul and we couldn't sleep. After arriving at Istanbul airport, we had about 6 hours layover time. We decided to spent this time in the town. On our way back to airport due to getting caught in traffic jam, we reached the boarding gate after closing the gate while the airplane still was stopped at the gate. The staff didn't let us to get onboard and we missed our flight from Istanbul. After missing our flight we were told to go to the Care Point counter. This was the first office which we were referred to. They didn't provide us with any help and told us to go to the ticket sale office. Finding the right ticket sale office was like a marathon for us. There were several counters for ticket sale with Turkish Airline logo. After talking to two ticket sale office, we finally were directed to the main Turkish Airlines ticket sale office where we were told that they are not able to help us and we have to pay the full price for the business class for the flights in the next day. After that, they asked us to talk to the supervisor where we observed the worst treatment that a customer may experience. He even didn't let us to explain our story and didn't listen to us. He just asked us to contact customer care centre by phone. After about 15 minutes talk with customer care centre over the phone, they also told us that they are not able to help us. Finally after being passed to several offices and people by Turkish Airlines staff without getting any help, we decided to buy new tickets to Isfahan, Iran instead of Tehran for the next day from an agency at the airport. The new tickets were sold to us at full price without any discount for the missed flight. I showed the new tickets to the same supervisor to transfer our luggage to the new destination and also complained about his behavior with us. After all of these unpleasant stories, we went to the Turkish Airlines Hotel Desk, where they told us that because our tickets are new and not transit tickets, they cannot help us with accommodations in Istanbul, and we were forced to book a hotel from an agency at the airport.",Detractor

"  Istanbul to Washington. Turkish Airlines is still good. The catering on board is suffering from bean counter recommendations. Gone are the days when Business Class food on board Turkish Airlines was exceptional. Now it is ordinary. It is sad to see such short sighted measures being implemented which may have a long lasting impact on the airline's reputation. The flight was on time but the airplane was old. It was clean but the age showed. The most outstanding aspect of the flight was the crew. They were helpful, pleasant, attentive, and friendly. One crew member kept bringing me tea (without my asking) while I worked for about six hours. She always had a pleasant smile throughout the trip. I wrote this review to ensure that the crew's effort did not go unnoticed.",Promoter
"  London to Manila return via Istanbul. Check in was very quick we checked in 3 large suitcases with our 80kgs combined allowance we also had two carry on trolley cases a rucksack and suit holder asked if we could check in the rucksack to save dragging it around with us even though we were on the check in limit, yes sir no problem. Spent time in the business class lounge to wait for boarding. Arrived at the boarding gate checked through boarded the plane first. Flight London to Istanbul was 4 hours approx, seat was very comfortable flight attendants very good and spoke perfect English. There was a chef who came round and took our order for our meal. The food was excellent. IFE was good but not great could do with upgrading but acceptable. We arrived in Istanbul on time and were bussed to the terminal business class passengers were off the plane first and had there own bus. we had about two hours. so spent time in the Turkish Airlines Lounge then headed to our gate to board our plane for Manila. this is the only fault I found with this trip. There was no business class priority boarding just everybody trying to to get through the check in and only one member of staff checking tickets and passports absolutely ridiculous it was mayhem finally got through the check in and were last to board a waiting bus (I would not have liked to be first on the bus) to take us to the aircraft. We were welcomed on board by the flight attendants and given a pre flight drink and our suit holder was hung up for us. The seats were comfortable and spacious and turned into a flatbed with the ottoman at the foot and for once I actually slept during the flight which is a rarity for me. The IFE was the same as mentioned before Our section of the business cabin had 28 seats which less than half were occupied. Flight attendants were very attentive spoke perfect English. The chef came round asked to fill out a menu card for our breakfast at the end of our flight and also took our order for our meal again it was a fantastic meal the best we have had in the air. We were a little late taking off from Istanbul for our 12 hour flight but still arrived at Manila 1 hour early. We were first off the plane through immigration got to the carousel to pick our luggage our 4 bags because of the priority tags were in the first 10 bags we were out of Manila airport 25 minutes after getting off the plane.

"  Houston to Odessa via Istanbul. October 25th 2017 my mother supposed to fly Houston to Istanbul. It was cancelled for some technical reason. She was already in the airport, when the flight got delayed and cancelled later on. She spent 8 hours in the airport, from 7pm till 3am, was inside the plane for 1,5 hour and then got kicked out with everyone else. No one offered any complementary food, water wasn't given. Somehow at 3:30 am they provided the hotel, but she had to share it with the other 2 passengers not related to each other. The transport wasn't provided, so she had to pay for taxi from her own. By 11 am the hotel told them to check out. She left hotel and took taxi back to the airport. Only business class was take care of. We spent another 5 hours in the airport waiting for some news. At 5 pm they opened check in for another flight. After all this long upsetting time the new flight got delayed again! For another 1,5 hours.

  Montreal to Istanbul on Turkish Airlines. Quick check-in and boarding. The hard product is comfortable but lacks privacy due to 2x2x2 configuration of the business class cabin which means no direct aisle access for all seats. The FA's were pleasant and professional although their English was not very good. Food quality was average and below their historical standards. Toilets were kept reasonably clean and tidy throughout the journey. IFE had many choices but list of films needed an update with very few recent releases. Flight left on time and arrived a full hour ahead of schedule. The disembarkation via buses remains a total nuisance and mystery as there were plenty of vacant air bridges. Overall a decent experience but the business class product is inferior to the Gulf and Southeast Asian carriers.,Passive

Overseas seats are not private and small. The land facilities were crowded, disorganized, and fairly dirty. A very low-end business class with fairly poor treatment.",Detractor
"  This is the first time I have flown Turkish Airlines and I had high expectations after seeing their commercials on TV and reading about them on various internet sites. I was flying business class from New York JFK to Bangkok via Istanbul (3 hour lay-over). My first leg was on a B777-300ER. The flight was 1 hour late departing JFK due to late arrival of the aircraft. The business class, flat bed configuration was 2x3x2, so even if you were seated in an aisle, you got disturbed by the other person wanting aisle access. I see this as a major draw-back on long flights (9 hours) when you are trying to sleep and someone is crawling over you multiple times to use the bathrooms. My second leg from Istanbul to Bangkok (also 9 hours) was on a A330 with a 2x2x2 business class configuration. On this plane you definitely want the middle seats as each person has direct aisle access. With that being said, the flat beds on both flights were spacious, comfortable and functional with lots of storage. The in-flight entertainment system was very good with an extensive and up-to-date selection of movies, TV shows, live sports etc. The food service was very good with the onboard chefs serving you. I did not use the WiFi, but it seemed it was difficult to connect to as many of the passengers in business class both flights were asking the flight attendants for assistance. The cabin staff were well trained, professional and attentive. Overall I would give them 4 stars, mostly due to the dual business class seat configuration when most of the Asian and Middle East carriers have individual pods and the one hour late departure from JFK.",Promoter

On board, the hard product looked in decent shape with comfortable seating in both upright and lie-flat positions. My request to be relocated to another seat was honoured allowing me to travel with a vacant neighbouring seat. Catering was once again below the standard I had previously experienced on this carrier and definitely below business class catering on the Asian and Middle Eastern carriers. There is clear evidence they are cutting corners with catering which is unfortunate as it used to be their main differentiator. The FA's were attentive and promptly responded to requests. The biggest issue in flight was the cabin temperature which was uncomfortably hot and took a long time to regulate after many passengers complained. Also the toilets could have used more attention which I had to point out on two occasions. The IFE was OK and had a decent selection of movies and a great music library. The free wifi worked well throughout the journey. We were late departing but arrived on schedule. Upon landing, we disembarked via the stairs as we did the last time I traveled on this route.

"  Amsterdam to Mauritius, with a stopover in Istanbul. That part of the journey went well, without any problems, good service. The return trip was badly organized. On September 30th, flight TK161 (Mauritius-Istanbul) was scheduled for 20.05. First we received the announcement that the flight was delayed until 21:30. At 20:30 we had to go to another gate and then we heard that the flight was canceled. We had to go to another gate, were listed, had to pick up the luggage, went thru the passport check and after 1 hour we were transported by bus to hotels. Our hotel: Palms Hotel, Quatre Bornes, Mauritius, a 45-minute drive. Room was reasonable but did not seemed to be used recently, because all the lamps were still disconnected and we had no hot water. Dinner consisted of rice, red pepper potatoes, lettuce and a meat sauce. We have been able to rest for 3 hours because sleep was not possible due to the noise of a disco / nightclub. We were told that breakfast was served at 4pm at night, at the reception. But there was nobody, we had to switch on the lights ourselves. At 04:50 a few crackers, butter, slices of sausage, pineapple and yogurt were placed on a table. No coffee, tea, water, etc. Another group was lucky because they were transferred to a luxury hotel, where they could sleep and have a real breakfast. At 5:00pm the buses went to the airport. At 6:00 pm check-in, including luggage, but the staff was very chaotic, there was no supervision. We were promised that they were already arranging the transition stopover in Istanbul. At 8:30 the plane left for Istanbul where we arrived more than 9 hours later. Some people who also had a transfer flight, received a boarding pass at the exit of the gate, but most had to go to the Transfer Desk very quickly. There we were totally hopeless when we saw a queue of 80, perhaps 100 people. A hard-working employee selected 20 persons. Fortunately, we belonged to that group (entirely random) that was brought to a Business Transfer Desk after a 2nd quick 10 minute walk. At first, they wanted or could not handle anything for us. Eventually they gave the Amsterdam people of that group, new boarding passes, TK1955 Istanbul-Amsterdam from 19:30. We were lucky because we arrived at 22:05 in Amsterdam. When we got there, we missed 1 of our 2 suitcases. And we were not the only victims, because the entire handling and registration cost us 2 hours extra time. Sunday night at 2:00 we were at home, at last. Monday afternoon we were told that the suitcase was found and was kept behind in Istanbul. End well, all right, we would like to say, but not in this case, definitely not. We still do not know what the reason for the flight cancellation was. We wondered ourselves, again and again why everything went so extremely wrong. A technical defect can happen and that they do not want to take any risks, we all understand that. However, during our hotel stay and flight to Istanbul, Turkish Airlines had 22 hours to arrange a connecting flight + boarding passes for all, but nothing seemed to be arranged. Why were we dragged from one place to another, had to watch desperate and exhausted how their employees had heated discussions and everything was so organized badly?",Detractor
"  Cluj-Napoca to Singapore via Istanbul and it was one of the best flight experiences so far. You can freely book your seat in advance (unlike on some airlines where you have to pay for your seat if reserving in advance or they'll seat you miles apart). We flew on an A320 for the short 1 hour flight to IST. The service was great, and my choice on their website for a lactose free meal was met, which was a nice surprise, taking into account the length of the flight. If you have more than a 6 hour layover in Istanbul (which we did), free tours of Istanbul are offered at various times. We took the 6 hour tour, and the tour itself, although a little rushed, was way better than sitting around in the airport. A free meal and entry tickets to attractions are included in the tour. The Boeing 777 to Singapore was impeccable. In flight entertainment is offered in each headrest with various movies, TV shows, live TV and selections of music. The food is very good and the staff is very kind and helpful. Seats are comfortable and although the pitch could be better, most people around me, including myself could find a position to sleep through most of the 10 hour flight.

I then met a staff member and he called someone in Istanbul to see if it was possible. After a few phone calls, he asked for my credit card details and was able to upgrade the rest of my family to business class. The reason this is so impressive is that he had to go against the inbuilt systems to delight a customer.

"  London to Mombasa via Istanbul, after being told and having my ticket verified by a lady agent at the international transit desk just before passport control that i qualify for a free transit hotel for a layover as my transit time was 18hours. I also met the other requirements such as being in transit from a Turkish Airlines flight to another Turkish Airline flight that was international as well as the connection flight being the only option hence being forced by the Turkish Airlines schedule structure thus requiring a layover as there was no shorter connection from Istanbul with Turkish Airlines on the same day. After having arrived at the hotel desk with people who just got of the flight I was told that the hotels were full and there was nothing he could do about it apart from offering me a voucher to compensate for the hotel for a bus trip around Istanbul at 7am - bearing in mind that its was 2am and I had no sleep. Long story short he claimed to be the supervisor and a colleague beside him the manager, he gave me a counter number for the Turkish Airlines customer service number to which I called and was told I met the requirements but they wouldn't provide, forcing me to give up. I not only wasted $30 for the visa required to get through passport control but my time. They also use a trick to bypass the free transit hotel: If they are aware of long delays (more than 10 hours) they just break down 1 big delay into multiple short delays. If they adds flights to their schedule between the time of booking and date of travel they will not offer the hotel.",Detractor

The plane was really poor and crew visibly uninterested to try resetting entertainment system or finding a suitable seat for me. They did not care. Very disappointing.",Detractor
"  Cologne to Shiraz via Istanbul. My first plane was delayed in Cologne so I couldn't catch my next flight so Turkish Airlines offered a ticket for my final destination which was due in 18 hours. In such situations you can either go to a hotel and rest or take a city tour. The hotel was supposedly 5 star, I would not say that my residence was bad, but I prefer to be home on time.",Passive
"  London to Kuala Lumpur via Istanbul. Really impressed with the hard products and 9 abreast seats in B777 economy. Even more impressed with the live television services, though limited channels. I would not have imagined watching a UEFA Champions League / World Cup qualifier game whilst travelling intercontinental. Food is good relative to other airlines. Was relieved that my check-in luggage made it through to Kuala Lumpur, after there was a 50 minutes delay from my departure at Heathrow. At Istanbul, I was off the plane and straightaway dashed to my connection gate. Made it into the connection to Kuala Lumpur, but was resigned that my luggage wouldn't make it and may come in on the following flight. Thankfully, it reached KUL together with me. One reservation about the hardproduct is seat pitch, especially on the A330. I'm 6 foot 1, and really feel the tightness. Not much improvement on the B777, but perhaps bearable for a 9 hours flight.",Passive
"  London to Riyadh via Istanbul. I booked a seat by the window on the right-hand side. The flight left at 01:20 so I expected to be able to sleep. On going through the gate security the staff scribbled out the seat number and wrote the same row (31, I believe, the second to last row) but wrote seat E. I asked why and they said the plane had been changed but it was the same size as the first leg and I was supposed to be in the exact same seat - 31F. I tried to engage them further but they just waved me off. The flight attendants on board said the flight was overbooked which was a lie. The person next to me, who had taken my seat, was a woman with a crying baby. I said nothing to her as that would be rude, and I'm not as rude as Turkish Airlines' staff. This is by no means the first time it has happened, but only seems to be leaving or entering Saudi Arabia. Sometimes I appreciate a woman doesn't want to be seated next to a male stranger, but this woman was still next to me, and had the side of the plane to lean on - exactly why I chose to book the seat in advance, instead of just turning up knowing the staff will steal someone else's. One good point was she had a huge, blow up cushion between her and the aircraft window which I will look for and use when I fly in future, with a different airline of course.",Detractor
"  Hong Kong - Istanbul - Copenhagen on B777-300 and A321, respectively. Flew 5+6 September 2017. Both flights on time. I arrived very early due to few connections to HKG from my departure town Danang by Vietnam with a LCC carrier, Jetstar. Thus I had to leave transit and pick luggage after immigration. However, I could not check in early in HKG so I had to take the Airport Express train and backtrack myself some 40 km downtown for city check in which is possible 8 hours prior to departure while in Airport only 4 hours are granted. The city check-in took 2 minutes when finally there, but to access the Kowloon station in question (for city check-in) took me >1 hour. By checking in there I got rid of my luggage and the BP issued granted me lounge access upon returning to HKG airport. I tried all three Star-alliance lounges and found Silverkris having the best food, drinks, and staff, while the Thai and United lounges had stunning panorama view towards the tarmac making up for modest food and drink supplies (and no champagne) and very few staff. Onboard the FAs are friendly and caring. However, all appear to be of only one (Turkish?) nationality. This is a pity as they obvious have received limited, internal training - which results in a less perfect flight experience as the FA's, in general, have lower skills and possess limited, modest exposure. The wandering cook onboard is superfluous in my view and makes a clown out of himself. IFE good. Headphones were of superb quality (â€œDevonâ€). Chairs turned into spacious flat beds. Full set of bedsheets provided. Toilets clean throughout. Food was very good with options. Two full meal rounds served on this 12 hour flight - plus dine on demand was apparently possible (hot snacks). Drinks fine with G.H. Mumms champagne. Transit in Istanbul is normally a hassle but this time it went smooth and no queues. CIP lounge is a breeze â€“ I had nice shower and a delicious breakfast. The last sector IST-CPH was on an A321-200 with true business class seats (2 x 2 configuration) and good service including offering champagne in mini-bottles. Only 6 seats were occupied (out of 20) on this morning flight. IFE also good.",Promoter

We were informed by the employee there, to get to another gate which was wrong walking again for a long distance and then finally got at the transfer desk, where after a long waiting que we were informed for our overnight stay in a hotel in Istanbul so as to get the flight of 7.00 am to Budapest.

"  Brussels to Istanbul. Business class has the typical recliners that are better than most airlines in narrow body aircraft. My check in experience in Brussels was horrible. The business class check in agent was unexperienced and arrogant. It literal took 20min to get my bags on the plane and then she started nagging about my handluggage hereby strictly enforcing an 8kg business class rule. I went to see the station manager, had to repack stuff whereafter she once sgain said it was too much. Another trip to station manager and with some dont do it again words he let me go. I had to run to get on my plane. One thing is for sure I wont do it again and will choose another airline. I recommend the airline not to use such personalities for customer service.",Passive
"  Buenos Aires to Barcelona via Istanbul. Seats are ok, but not the best. The good thing is that they are fully flat, the bad thing is that they do not all offer direct aisle access (and that there are 3 seats together in the middle row in business class). That said, I also have to say that the Buenos Aires - Istanbul flight is very long because of the stop in Sao Paulo, but flying business class in TK makes it seem shorter, the IFE is quite good and the food is great. I take this flight twice a year and even though the food service deteriorated a bit lately, it is still very good compared to other airlines (unfortunately on my last flights there was no more amuse bouche, no more many options of starters to pick from the trolley and no more final trolley with coffee and petit fours-the latter was now consolidated with the dessert trolley, also the champagne on board was downgraded from Taittinger to Mumm). As I said the meals service is still good but it could be a lot better if flight attendants would be more proactive at offering drinks and refills. They just do not do it, you need to call them every time you need a refill (it does not happen in many other airlines) and when you do they take forever and it is obvious are not willing to do it. Overall, I would recommend TK business class because the food is very good and the seats are confortable, but they need to improve the service on board. If they did, they would be quite perfect.",Passive
  Dammam to London via Istanbul. Paid for seat reservations on both flights and they were not honoured. When I asked the flight team I was told there was nothing that could be done.

Deeply unhappy. I will not be using them again.,Detractor

"  For my vacation to Turkey I decided to fly with Turkish Airlines instead of a charter airline like SmartWings. We boarded an A321-200 in Prague, seats were really nice with really good pitch and each seat has personal IFE which is geat for a 2 hours flight. The headphones were not very good, but thats ok. Problem was that for half of the flight the IFE wasn't working, but when it did it had plenty of movies, games, music etc. We received a warm sandwich and dessert on this flight which were tasty along with a good seletion of drinks, only problem was that only 1 drinks round was made. Second flight was on a Boeing 737-800 which was a bit older and only had screens above our heads, but it was a 55 minute flight (on the way back this flight was operated by A321-200 with IFE) and even on this short flight we received drinks and food (same sandwich just no dessert). Overall these were really nice flights and I would fly with Turkish again. The A321 was really nice and IFE for 2 hours flight is great, it is just the crew that could be little bit better.",Promoter
"  Johannesburg to Brussels via Istanbul. Our first holiday that we flew with Turkish Airlines and probably our last. However we are satisfied about the staff on board, it's the lack of customer care that makes the final result of this review. As we arrived home we found out that one of the locks of our suitcases was damaged in a way that this lock could not be used any more. No message of Customs was left. An inquiry at Samsonite showed that this part can not be repaired. So we are forced to buy a new suitcase because of this damage. Turkish Airlines is responsible to take care of our bagage and if some problem occurs, they should offer a solution. Challenge 1 is to find out how to claim damaged baggage. Found on the internet and made a claim the next day. Challenge 2 is to convince Turkish Airlines (Customer Care) about the real cause of the damage, since they decline a claim immediately. Challenge 3 is to convince them about the fact that the suitcase is not repairable. If it would be, we should send it to a national Samsonite repair center (costs!). But they confirmed that the lock is no longer available (only during the warranty time of 5 years). A copy of these emails were sent to TA, but the refuse to accept it and think about another solution. Challenge 4 is to convince TA that for me the only solution is that I have to buy a new suitcase, which I did, and to get a refund as compensation. I bought a new Samsonite, sent my invoice to them and asked them to solve this matter, but again they answered that only repairs will be paid. When you pay over 2500 Euros for your tickets, you have the right to expect customer service as it should be. Let's end positive about the airplane and staff. The airplane is new well cleaned and you there is a lot of entertainment to choose on your personal screen. Staf is really friendly and drinks and meals are alright. We just did not understand why on a night flight it took so long to get your meal after the take off. It would be nice to get it earlier and then get some more time to sleep.",Detractor

"  Jakarta to Sao Paulo return via Istanbul with Boeing 777-300ER in Business Class. I felt that the entertainment screen is quite small, it is adequate but would be great if we could enjoy larger screen size. Food options were satisfying and presentation was nice thanks to Do&Co catering. It would be great if they offer flexibility to their pax to be able to opt to dine whenever they wish (not only in a designated meal service time). This is particularly for the red-eye flight like Sao Paulo-Istanbul which depart at 3am and a meal was served just after take off. Cabin crew polite and courteous especially Indonesian-bound flight. Lounge at Istanbul was great with many food selections but much fewer when you departing late at night. One most point that need to be improved is the boarding arrangement at the Departure Gate especially for Business Class Passengers ! There was indeed a special Line for business class pax but mostly were blocked by the long economy pax queue that we had to struggle to find the dedicated line for business class pax.",Promoter

"  Flying Turkish Airlines is always a good if not great experience regardless of what class you are flying. But I have to say that what distinguishes TK from any other airline I have travelled with, and I do travel a lot for both work and leisure, is the customer service. It is absolutely exceptional. I have missed my flight with a different airline twice, because of the airport I flew out of and both times Turkish airlines saved my trip! Even though they were not responsible for the problems I had in the airports or with the airlines, because my connecting flights were through Turkish Airlines they were the people that got me on the next flight in a most convenient timeframe and manner. The first time I travelled with Turkish Airlines, the representative even booked a hotel for me, because I was a college student traveling to the US for the first time and I missed my flight with a different airline because of a long customs line in the airport. Not only that but they also rebooked my three connecting flights for the next day and provided all the information I would need to have a safe comfortable stay in a strange city.

"  Istanbul to Bangkok. After several positive flight experiences with Turkish Airlines, my last flight from Istanbul to Bangkok was very disappointing. The flight boarded, albeit somewhat chaotically, on time. Once all passengers were on board, we waited for about 1 hour before an announcement was made that the aircraft needed to be changed due to technical problems. That in itself was not a major problem, though somewhat of an inconvenience, however attention to safety was appreciated. Once we were back in the gate boarding area, there was only one ground agent who seemed to have no idea how to cope with the situation. No announcements were made. Once a new departure time was set for 2 hours later, we boarded a new aircraft. The cabin staff seem to have been affected by all of this, as our flight was now almost 3 hours delayed. After serving the meal they were nowhere to be seen for a long time, some left with empty meal trays for 1 hour before passengers had had enough and started clearing their own trays by bringing them to the galley. I made a comment about this inconvenience to the flight purser, who told me that he would have to ""write me up"" for making a complaint about the long wait time for clearing up after the meal service. I was disappointed by this attitude and treatment.",Passive
"  Flew Dalaman to Istanbul Ataturk. Found the Business Class check-in tucked away in the corner of a seething departure hall. Showing my Gold card, I was politely and promptly checked in. I was told where to find the CIP lounge. In there it felt more like a school playground with children running noisily around in circles. Obviously not the fault of Turkish Airlines. Slight delay in boarding as the aircraft came in late. No boarding announcements made (until I boarded at least) but people just moved forward. One lady called out something in barely audible Turkish language, but nothing in English. Before take-off they showed the safety briefing on drop-down screens. Those screens then remained down, just showing the Turkish Airlines logo, throughout the flight. In fact they were still down as we got off the plane in Istanbul. After take-off the Captain explained and apologised for the delay. We were served a warm cheese and tomato roll with soft and hot drinks. In fact identical to the snack when I flew from Istanbul a few days earlier. But it was welcome and tasty and perfectly adequate for 11.30 pm. Two very smiling and friendly flight attendants served us. As we flew in circles the Captain announced a change in runway meant a further 15 minutes delay. We finally landed - with the only occupant in the row in front of me in his seat fully reclined. After landing we were told we could use our electronic devices so I looked at the flight path we had flown. It was certainly convoluted!

She then directed us to the Turkish Airline counter but he told us that he cannot help us. We pointed out that we only have two small carry-on bags and all we need is a boarding pass (and we still had 50 minutes to departure). He refused with a smirk adding that that's not his problem.

Biggest negative was the very tight leg-room on the long-legs of this trip, especially since the person in front of me put their seat back as soon as we took off for the entire 10 hour trip. Big suggestion - get on the plane as soon as you can so you can store your carry-on in the overhead compartment, otherwise you are in big trouble for leg room. I felt claustrophobic on the Boston to Istanbul leg because of this issue.

"  Bangkok to London via Istanbul. First leg from Bangkok was an A330. Flight was delayed due to weather in BKK, unfortunately they only announced the delay after everyone had gone to the gate. Flight boarded about 45 min late and the crew were not quite ready when passengers boarded as they had arrived late and seemed a bit stressed about the delay which stuck with them for most of the flight. Despite the stress they were friendly and provided a good service. Welcome drinks were served but they ran out of TK's signature lemonade, which is a bit poor. That said the flight was otherwise great, dinner was served swiftly after take off and the food was a huge improvement on the outbound flight. The steak was one of the best I have had on a flight for years. After dinner beds were made and the lights were turned off. Breakfast was served about 2 hours before landing and this time the crew did remember to collect the breakfast orders so everything was served correctly. Despite the delay in take off we landed on time in IST. Transfer security were not quite awake when we showed up at 4 am in IST but we got through quickly and on to the excellent lounge at IST. While the lounge is excellent, by 6am is was extremely busy and seat were hard to come by. As personal electronic devices has to be gate checked for travel to the UK the gate process took about 15 minutes to get through but TK has done a fairly good job of streamlining the process, especially for business class passengers. Boarding was reasonably organised and boarding for the LHR flight was quickly completed. Flight this time was a Boeing 777 which left on time from IST. Again breakfast was quickly served. While the hot choice was limited is was tasty none the less. The cabin crew was far more relaxed on this flight and an absolute pleasure. Flight landed on time at LHR.

"  Beijing to Atlanta via Istanbul. The flight itself was very good. My issue is with the mediocre to bad service outside of the flight.

I made sure that I purchased the ticket with the correct code (B) since you can only upgrade on Y and B codes. Then I upgraded the ticket using my miles, but was then told that the upgrade would change the code to an I. Code I does means that I get no miles for the flight even though I paid full price for the ticket. I tried to contact Turkish Airlines through their website and received no reply. I tried to contact them through their social media sites and was told to be patient and I would receive a reply. Two weeks later I checked the status and found out that Turkish Airlines had canceled my ticket. I contacted my travel agent who found out that my upgrade had created a duplicate ticket in their system so they had just canceled everything, all without informing me.

And they do not weigh more than golf equipment or don't take up more space than a golf bag. I've never dealt with an airline that has such inconsistent rules regarding baggage, and made taking other goods overseas so difficult. Speaking to customer service they can't do anything either. Oh and they don't charge sports baggage fees as a single trip return, they charge for each destination where you stop / layover, both there and back, so you could pay up to 90 euros one way,and the same return.",Detractor

Lay flat beds, however you do have to get up to allow them to put the thin mattress down, but the choice is yours. Meals are good. They are better than many other airlines I have travelled on. The only suggestion would be that the breakfast could be improved slightly. Main course and dessert are really good for airline food. I did once have a hot chocolate and that will be something I never have again. Inflight entertainment offers a limited selection. They could be more up to date movies. Wifi is a good addition too. The whole situation about not being able to take a laptop onboard from Istanbul to London was a right hassle. Chaotic and wasn't controlled well. No signage. People didn't know where they were going, didn't know they had to queue or that they had to have their bags checked again before going to the gate. Check in counter is separate for business class passengers but this is where it ends. When you get to the gateyes they call you up first. But if you are running late, there isn't a clear lane in IST for you to board. Overall I will continue to fly Turkish Airlines as they offer a really good service for a really good price. I can let the attention they don't provide to the customers go, but it does need to be addressed. There also doesn't seem to be anything available to snack on in-between meals. I have flown with them a few times and nothing has been on show or shown in the menu.",Promoter
"  Flew London Heathrow to Bangkok via Istanbul. TK1980/TK0064. Decided to go with Turkish Airlines as they had a compelling offer for the holidays. Check-in at LHR was quick and efficient, priority security check provided and access to any of the Star Alliance lounges in Terminal 2 (LH, United, Singapore or Canadian or the Premium Plaza lounge which TK contracts). Boarding began a little late and started somewhat disorganised with conflicting announcements but once the gate agents got them selves sorted boarding was quick and efficient. Lunch was served on the short flight to IST, single tray with 3 options for main course. Not great but beats most airlines. Seat was fully flat and IFE was excellent although no WiFI on this flight. The cabin attendants were a bit robotic but very nice. Flight was on time in to IST and when straight to a gate. On disembarkation there was a choice for connecting flights or arrivals but it looked like they had cordoned off the connecting flight route. Turned out they wanted to see boarding passes to let you through, slightly confusing and not very intuitive. Next flight was also on time, this time there was WiFi on top of the excellent IFE and although the WiFi was slow it worked well through the flight. The cabin crew were fantastic with the attendants looking after our section coming around at the beginning of the flight to introduce herself and point out the cabin service director as well. Seats were comfortable and everything worked with the cabin clean and tidy upon boarding. Amenity kits were handed out shortly after boarding. The evening meal was served about 45 minutes after take off. The starter and desert were great but the mains were pathetic, labelled as â€œsalad and steakâ€ it took some searching of the salad to find the miniature piece of beef. Meals have clearly declined with TK. We were given cards to order breakfast but they were never collected and the breakfast handout was a bit random and the hot options were a bit strange but tasted ok none the less. Overall a good flight, worth recommending if the price point is right.",Promoter

"  Istanbul to Athens. Unfortunately the plane was delayed, otherwise it was a pleasant flight.

  Dublin to Istanbul. I enjoyed my flight. It left on time and check in and boarding went very smoothly. The meal was very tasty.

"  Istanbul to Montreal on Turkish Airlines. Check-in slower than normal for priority lane on account of extra layer of checks for flights bound for North America. Boarding by zone numbers and quite orderly. On board, the hard product was a little weathered with scuff marks and torn trim. The flight left the gate 35 minutes late and there was no reason provided other than ""operational issues"". Once airborne, a 5-course lunch was served along with a wide range of drink choices. The food was quite tasty and well presented. The FA's were warm, friendly and very attentive. A special mention goes out to the staff who looked after my side of the aisle with a permanent smile and cheery demeanour throughout the entire flight. The IFE had a good selection but was awkward to navigate at times. Tolilets needed attention and were not always clean / tidy. Flight landed 30 minutes late and for an unknown reason we disembarked via airside buses which is extremely rare for Montreal. Overall the experience was positive and the cabin crew were exceptional.",Promoter
"  Turkish Airlines flight from Montreal to Istanbul was delayed for 10 hours as per online information. Connecting passengers were taken to hotel room but after 10 hours when passengers arrived to airport from hotel, the plane was further delayed for 12 hours. Passengers could not go back to hotel, as hotel checked them out already. So passengers were left in hotel lobby for additional 12 hours. Wheelchair assisted passengers were left with little to no help provided.",Detractor

First meal was nice, second not very. Entertainment system was good. Flight had Wifi which is always a help. Plane was clean although the decor looked old, tired. Istanbul Airport is excellent with one of the best lounges I have ever been in. Enjoyed the flight, price was very good, will definitely fly with Turkish again!",Promoter
"  I was particularly looking forward to TK 1, my first trans-Atlantic business class experience. In most aspects, the flight was outstanding. Lamentably, the only negative occurred right at the start. Check-in went quickly, and the Gold Track security line was instantaneous. I did not have much time to experience the TK lounge because the TV monitors called passengers to the gate and hour and a half before departure. Gate 208 at IST was an absolute caldron. Of course, the security checks for USA departures are extensive, and as I had been informed, my ipad needed to be gate-checked. The problem was waiting and waiting in a huge crowd in a painfully hot gate area. By the time we boarded, I was drenched in perspiration. This is a problem that must be addressed, because a flight that begins uncomfortably in the extreme has to struggle to get back into pleasant territory. Nevertheless, once we boarded, the experience was exceptional. Seating on the 777-300 is 2x3x2. Every seat was occupied, but the seats themselves were full recline and provided adequate room. It almost goes without saying that the DO & CO food onboard was plentiful and delicious. TK provides a dining experience comparable to that of a fine restaurant. Cabin service was outstanding, and passengers who wanted to work or surf were provided with a laptop. The various quirks of the laptop took some time to decipher, but in the end, this provided several hours of amusement. There was a huge selection of movies, music, games, and TV shows. If Turkish Airlines can get control of the boarding experience, their business class service would be easily a 10.",Promoter
"  Madrid to Istanbul was about as seamless and enjoyable as a flight can get. Check-in was immediate and friendly, the Sala Cibeles at Barajas is an excellent lounge, departure and arrival were punctual, and onboard service was outstanding.

"  Toronto to Istanbul on Turkish Airlines. Having had my original flight out of Montreal cancelled and rerouted through Toronto with a 24-hour delay, I was bracing for the worst. Contrary to my expectations, everything from check-in through to landing was in perfect order. Flight pulled from the gate slightly behind schedule but landed early. On board, the hard product was starting to show its age with worn out seats and trim. The cabin crew were excellent with smiles all around and very attentive service throughout the journey. The food was not up to TK's usual standard and having flown them long distance multiple times in recent months, I have noticed the quality and quantity have deteriorated. The wines served were the same as what they had on board back in September of last year but plentiful nonetheless. The IFE had a good a selection although it could have benefitted from more recent releases. The seat was comfortable allowing me to get 6 hours of restful sleep. Toilets were kept clean throughout the journey. It was a pleasant experience on the balance and the cabin chief deserved special mention given how he handled my request to be moved to another seat.",Passive
"  Montreal to Istanbul on TK36. Arrived at the airport 2 hours prior to departure only to find out check-in had been suspended. Passengers were left waiting in the queues for quite sometime before the TK station manger popped up and told everyone the flight had been cancelled. What ensued can only be described as chaos with agents running around collecting contact information from passengers so that they could be notified of their rerouted itinerary. TK operates three flights per week on this route with the next flight scheduled to leave only on Friday. This resulted in a long and extremely slow moving queue in front of the ticketing counter as two agents tried to reprocess a plane load of people. The rest of the ground staff ran around looking like they knew what they were doing but accomplishing next to nothing. The station manager was nowhere to be found with many passengers demanding answers. As the flight is often the very last one of the day, there were no other options left to get the passengers out on the same day with many having to contend with at least a one-day delay. Flight disruptions are an unavoidable part of air travel but TK is not equipped to deal with them as evidenced by the lack of coordination and inefficiency. Their call centre was equally ineffective as they kept saying there was nothing they could do. If TK is well and truly aspiring to become one of the leading carriers, they need to significantly pick up their game in customer relations and response to unforeseen events.",Detractor
"  The flight from Istanbul to Ankara is relatively short but on an early morning with good weather, it's a beautiful flight with a great view from the window. The service on Turkish Airlines is great even on this extremely short trip. Beverages and a breakfast sandwich are served. The breakfast was a simple cheese and tomato sandwich which seems quite standard for turkish breakfast but not too appetizing for me. On the flight to Ankara there was no in-flight entertainment system but there was on the return flight to Istanbul.",Promoter
"  Turkish Airlines makes a real effort to give even their economy passengers a positive experience. Their meals are tasty and generous. They distribute printed menus and amenity kits. Their check in staff are friendly and efficient. My originating United Airlines flight from Tampa was cancelled at the last minute, and after much scrambling, I arrived at the Turkish counter at JFK only 50 minutes before scheduled departure to IST. The flight had just closed, but the Turkish staff took pity on me and checked me in anyway. Both flights (New York JFK to Istanbul and Istanbul to Madrid) departed and arrived punctually. Despite the fact that the on-line seat map showed that the Kennedy - Ataturk flight was essentially empty up until the day before, when we boarded there were only a handful of empty seats. Where did those 150 mystery passengers come from? The economy class seat pitch is quite tight, I would have paid extra for an exit row seat, but it had appeared that I was going to have the whole back of the plane to myself. On the IST-MAD flight, we had an empty middle seat, and this contributed to a much more comfortable experience. My flight back to Turkey and the USA next week will be in business class, so I am looking forward to the award-winning premium service.",Passive
"  We booked our flight from Riga to Dubai with 1 stop in Istanbul about 4 months before the flight. According to the rules we arrived 2 hours prior the departure. Completing all necessary procedures and passing boarding control we got on the airplane. Engines started, next thing happening was us unloading the plane 10 minutes after boarding. Airline announced that the flight is cancelled due to aircraft technical issues. Next 6 hours were spent in a queue waiting for the decision on how we will reach our destination. When we reached an airline representative all she could offer us was either to return a money for the trip or to take a next possible flight, which was in 1 week. Airline representative also didn`t offer any other option like booking another airline via another airport. Moreover, they didn`t offer any compensation.",Detractor
"  Kuala Lumpur to Venice via Istanbul. The flight from Kuala Lumpur was real packed. I was seated on 50G. It was rather hot during the flight. Meal was plenty and tasty. I also like your special menu and unique drink such as sour cheery drink and home made lemonade. They are fantastic! Most cabin crews on Kuala Lumpur - Istanbul sector were nice and polite except one male crew looked grumpy but he still did the job well. Nothing to complain from Istanbul to Venice. Toilet was clean and with proper amenities. We got nice blanket, pillow and nice pouch (Kuala Lumpur - Istanbul sector) full of flying amenities such as lip balm, socks, eye shade, toothbrush and ear plug which are nice. AVOD needs improvement on film and song selection. Need to provide some asian movies and songs including in Chinese/Mandarin. You have ones in Malay but not Bahasa Indonesia although you also serve Jakarta airport. Wifi is on and off. A bit frustrating indeed. Other than that, I have nothing to complain.",Passive

It is filled with toothbrush, socks, eye shade, ear plugs, lip balm and sandals. Great offer. Crews tried to do hard to make us happy but since the plane was very full, I feel the response was rather late. I pressed cabin button but they came so long but I understand that they were real busy. I guess the plane was close to 100% full. The plane looked new. Toilet was clean with its amenities. However, AVOD needs improvement. More Asian movies and songs please including Chinese Mandarin and Bahasa Indonesia (not only Malay). Wifi needs also improvement. Kudos Turkish!.",Promoter
"  London Heathrow to Sharm el Sheik via Istanbul. The flight itself was fine - not notably good or bad compared to many other airlines I have been on. My bag was delayed on the connection which was annoying but acceptable for a day, but less ideal when it became a second day with no explanation or contact from Turkish Airlines. But, their response to the issue was the worst and most customer unfriendly service I have ever had from any provider or any service, and has remained so for weeks. No ability to raise the issue by email, and online service down. No-one seeming to read anything submitted, in favour of moving it to another department as fast as possible and not just once, but time and time again. Asking for image of my passport (that they didn't need), over an online submission form that is insecure, in breach of their own privacy policy and all passably acceptable practice",Detractor
"  Amsterdam to Amman via Istanbul. This trip was a 4 day trip with checked-in luggage. In both Amsterdam and Amman as well in transit in Istanbul we could use priority facilities allowing us to skip the lines for security. Turkish Airlines uses the Aspire Lounge in the Non-Schengen area of Schiphol Airport which was crowded and poorly stocked with food and drink options. In Amman they use the Royal Jordanian lounge which is spacious and well stocked with food and drink. During the 2 layover in Istanbul we used the Turkish Airline lounge which is huge with a lot of amenities and food options and again a good WIFI network. We even found some time to toy around with the Golf simulator on the lower floor of the lounge. The flights were the typical medium haul service, all 4 flights left reasonably in time and arrived spot on time at destination. On the day flights between Amsterdam and Istanbul a lunch respectively breakfast were offered. All the food was tasty and nicely presented. During the night flights between Istanbul and Amman, prior to take-off we were offered diner respectively breakfast but in both cases we opted to sleep which was perfectly possible in the sleeper seats in he A340 and A330. On all 4 flights the cabin staff was well groomed, nice and attentive but always stayed at distance.",Promoter

"  Istanbul to Montreal on Turkish Airlines. TK uses a dedicated business class check in with extra passport formalities for flights bound for Canada, USA, UK and Israel. This process was slow and added time to the check in process. Flight boarded slightly late but in an orderly fashion. On board, the hard product looked in decent shape with ample storage space for small articles. The overhead bin space however was limited due to the bedding they keep on hand. Drinks and lunch were offered after take off and having traveled the same route 6 weeks prior I was surprised to see the same menu. Despite that the food and wines were tasty and the service was with a smile. IFE had a good selection but the navigation was awkward at times. The Denon noise cancelling headphones were great. For reasons I have yet to understand Turkish turns on the cabin lights 3 hours prior to landing to serve an afternoon snack. Many other airlines do the same but not that far in advance of touchdown. This limits the amount of sleep you can expect to get. The wifi worked only part of the flight. It was an all around good flight with a great cabin crew. The French announcements from the cockpit were a nice touch. Flight departed late but arrived 40 minutes ahead of schedule.",Promoter

"Montreal to Budapest via Istanbul. I had quite high expectations of Turkish Airlines but after four flights with them I evaluate them as mediocre. Perhaps I made a wrong meal selection, but Oriental Vegetarian meal was very unappealing. Other meals were equally dissatisfying. I appreciated steel cutlery instead of plastic. I was also disappointed to see that Turkish provides small vanity bags in an attempt to make the flight more comfortable. I would still recommend Turkish, because I booked with them and the price for a direct flight to Montreal was a good one.",Detractor

"  This almost 11 hour flight happened in a brand-new aircraft. On-board entertainment as well as the seats were just perfect. As we flew from Kuala Lumpur there were some specialities like the fact that you are not able to buy water or go to a restroom after passing the security check, but this has certainly nothing to do with the airline, just the preamble to explain my later impatience. After boarding, it took the crew about 3 hours to organize the supper, what might be on schedule but beverages came even later! Never saw a crew being so messy. Almost every member constantly dropped something: our food, their own food, once they managed to drop a pasta portion twice. I asked for two beverages but the lady forgot my second request instantly (never happened before). So the whole catering procedure was messy, slow and ineffective. For the second meal the crew forgot our veggie meals, forgot to mention that the meals they offered contained meat. They were not rude nor disagreeable, just made this hard day far harder than it should be. Would try to avoid Turkish Airline for long flights from now on. By the way, the short flight from Istanbul to Zurich (3 h) in an old aircraft was perfectly organized.",Passive
"  Flew Turkish Airlines from Istanbul to London Heathrow. Slightly delayed departure after long line that involved multiple security checks. 2-3-2 fully reclining J seats with the latest onboard entertainment and WiFi.

The beef main course although delicious, lacking in portion. The crew were smiling but not forthcoming with drink refills. The lavatories were kept clean and the new Molton Brown products add to a quality experience. Overall an average flight with the usual excellent hard product.",Promoter
"  Sarajevo to Panama City via Istanbul. The first leg SJJ-IST was in a Boeing 737 in Row 1 with what must have been the worst leg-room I've witnessed in Business on a 737. The bulkhead is in front of your face and the only position to sit is upright. Fortunately the business class section was not full so I moved to a seat in Row 2, which had the seat in front of you to put your feet under. The service was good, and the meal was very good for so short a flight. The Istanbul to Panama City segment was on a semi-antiquated A330-200 which is 4 rows in a 2-2-2 configuration. The seat is comfortable for sitting upright and to a certain extent it is comfortable for relaxing. It is dreadful for sleeping, because the seat is so configured that in the ""angled flat"" position you slide down. I resolved this by putting my briefcase in the space under the seat in front of mine, and the briefcase then elevated my feet sufficiently to provide support to be able to lay comfortably without struggling to avoid sliding down the incline. The food on this carrier is much better than most European carriers, and light-years ahead of US carriers. The flight crew are sufficiently attentive to function without being over-the-top. When they finish serving, they disappear, and if you want something you'll need to call them and ask for it, or get up and get it yourself- they won't come by and volunteer. But the price is much cheaper than competitors on this route, and that forgives a lot. Overall, for the price, I'm more than satisfied. But if I had to pay full going price of European carriers, I'd fly Lufthansa or Air France, with flat bed seats and a more professional operation. A note of warning - unlike most Turkish long-haul aircraft which offer excellent wifi, this aircraft has no wifi, so you'd better enjoy reading.",Promoter

Toilets were kept clean and are now getting stocked with new nice amenities (flowers, high-quality hand lotions and hand cream) which on other airlines you would find on business class only. Seat pitch on the A330 is quite poor compared to the Boeing 777. As an Elite member, I could use on-board Wifi at no charge and the connection was stable and very good considering the altitude.

"  Tbilisi to Amsterdam via Istanbul. Flew TK for the first time (return flight) and I found it a bit overrated. Service and reliability is no better than most EU majors, and overall the comfort and service looks from another time. The seats and interiors are really old, and very narrow on the A320 models (a kid won't even fit). Service is not really outstanding like you read in reviews, just basic and a bit cheap. Cabin staff can be quite stiff and really not friendly, which does not give the best sense of welcome claimed in their marketing.

In both cases, the first flight was late, giving us barely 30 mins to catch the next flight whose gate was really far away. The connecting flight was also Turkish Airlines, but still there was no support at the airport even though their first flight was late. While coming back from Mumbai, at Istanbul, there was an additional security check and the queue was long and our flight was in 15 mins! Nobody gave us any support there either and by some luck, one of the fellow passengers in the same situation was told by people waiting with us that we can go to priority security check if the flight is leaving soon. There was no sign for this or any indication from either Turkish Airlines or airport staff. We barely made it to the next flight 2 mins before gate closed even though the aircraft didn't take off for next 30 mins or more.

Never been screened before anywhere entering a country. May have to do with our origin. Return, a quick friendly check in at Milan but terrible long lines at security and passport control. No gate posted for the departure until 55 min before, so uneasy walking around not knowing which wing to proceed to. Long tarmac delay with no explanation from TK. In general their English annoucements are difficult to understand. A320 with a friendly crew, nice hot lunch and a nice bar service. This time a jetway in Istanbul, good shopping, but staff does not speak English. Is this an International airport? Then get personnel who can assist in English.

The devices are wrapped in bubble packs and a special receipt is given to the passenger. The wrapped devices are placed in sturdy containers before your very eyes. At the other end, Turkish Airlines have a stand right after you clear the passport control but before clearing the customs. They check your receipt and give you back your laptop. No muss no fuss. Under the circumstances the operation is pretty smooth. I thought travelers should know.",Promoter
"  Singapore-Istanbul-Lisbon (return) on TK in mid-March. Turkish Airlines pretty much exceeded my expectations on the outward leg of my journey, and the service was even better on the return. Check-in and boarding in Singapore went swiftly, on board the A333 to Istanbul the food, drinks service and entertainment was excellent (you'll receive a menu for the service). Also received the best amenities kit of any airline I've flown - not even Qatar gives out slippers and lip balm in theirs! No amenities kit on the Istanbul-Lisbon sector but it was more of the same: good entertainment, good food and drinks on board a clean B738. Cabin crew were very friendly on both sectors. Return sector was even better - the flight left the gate at Lisbon Airport on time. Good service once again with the regular drinks service, delicious meal of roasted meat and a very friendly bunch of flight attendants The entertainment system on board the A320 winglets was better than my outgoing flights, with a better touchscreen interface. Departure from Istanbul-Singapore also on-time, with a new A333 that had the newest entertainment system on board (it has live news from BBC and CNN). Good meal service once again with a relish pasta rigatoni, although I wish they didn't run out of meal choices on board. A slightly different brand of amenities kit was given out on this flight, but the contents were the same. On-time arrival in Singapore. The only thing that I didn't like was the seat and legroom on the Singapore-Istanbul sector, but overall Turkish Airlines put a smile on my face. I look forward to flying with them again.",Promoter
  Istanbul to Montreal on Turkish Airlines. Used the business class check in which was hassle free. The lounge in Istanbul offered a great array of drink and meal options but the shower facilities were falling apart and appeared in need of an upgrade. Boarding was on time and orderly and we left on time. On board the seating was comfortable and FA's were attentive. Turkish Airlines catering is on a serious decline with portions smaller and quality not what it used to be. My main course was two pieces of overcooked thin slices of beef. The meal before landing was also disappointing. The wine selection was OK and Tattinger was appreciated. Toilets were not kept clean and I had to point out to FA's on two occoasions the need for a touch up. The wifi was reliable. Thee IFE was decent but could have used more recent movie releases. Announcements from the cockpit were scarce with flight details provided only in the beginning. Flight arrived ahead of schedule.,Passive
"  Amsterdam to Manila, via Istanbul with about 1hr layover in Istanbul and 5hr on the return flight. The price was very good for this route. This was my first time flying with Turkish Airlines and it was just fairly good. IFE had a good selection of movies also to keep me entertained, and they give you amenity kit which is nice. The planes were fairly nice too, minus on the way back home, Istanbul to Amsterdam, the aircraft was old and had no IFE, was a bit disappointing. The meals are very good overall, I loved the Cafe De Paris Chicken. Staff were so so, when I stepped in the plane, the two male FA's who are supposed to welcome people suddenly started chatting, and not welcoming me, not sure what this was about. On another flight they forgot to give me bread with my meal, they serve the bread after the meal I saw them giving other people but they never gave me. I would fly with them again if they have the cheapest ticket to my destination, otherwise not.",Passive

"  I had to get from Amsterdam to Antalya, and in winter time Turkish Airlines seemed to be the only decent option with a daily service. The flight was via SAW, the other airport in Istanbul. AMS-SAW was uneventful and not memorable, except the aircraft was an old A320 with a worn and not very clean cabin. No entertainment system, food offer was decent, but rather below average for an almost 4hr flight, flight attendants busy about themselves. Everything has indicated that the flights from and to SAW is a very low priority for Turkish Airlines. The scheduled transfer time in SAW was 1 hour, however the crowd at the passport control was far too huge to manage this within the time indicated in the reservation. I approached employees of Turkish Airlines and informed them about possible problems with my connection to AYT, and they could not help but tell me that yes, indeed there is no way to pass through the passport control except waiting in the line, then another employee put me on a fast track line, and then another one kicked me out of there explaining that I was not entitled to it. Most of the Turkish Airlines transfer staff also could not speak any English, and those who could had a lot of problems with this. At the end, it took me over 1 hr 30 min to pass through passport control, and I was rebooked to the next flight departing from SAW at 00.10 am instead of initially planned 8.05 pm. On the transfer desk they also gave me a voucher for a meal in McDonalds, the voucher could be redeemed only for the cheapest burger menu worth c.a. EUR 4.5. Needless to say, that is below anything that can be expected from a major air carrier, and I went to another place to get my meal on my own. No free internet in SAW, and the procedure for getting the paid one is crazily complicated. The flight from SAW to AYT was uneventful too, a brand-new B737-800 with a great entertainment system and a good sandwich",Detractor

"  London Heathrow to Addis Ababa via Istanbul. This has been my first time with Turkish Airlines and it will be the last one. The flight was delayed on departure for unknown reasons. Then it was kept on hold, as the captain informed us to ""fog"". We landed one hour later than expected and the connection flight for Addis Ababa did not wait for us. During the flight I was asking for information about the departure gate of my connection and no one was able to provide such information. The customer service at the Ataturk Airport was terrible to use a nice expression, nobody could explain what to do and where to go, it took a while to dig the needed information, queuing here and there at desks. I got the information that I could be booked on the next available flight (24 hours later) and that I could get a free night in hotel (I am paying for my hotel in Addis). Past the passport control we had to queue for more than one hour to get to the ""hotel desk"" by Turkish Airlines where staff took our boarding passes and 40 minutes later appeared calling our names and then bringing to get a shuttle to a 5 stars hotel in the middle of nowhere. All this took 4 hours. Here I am now, no dinner, meetings in Addis Ababa rescheduled and one day wasted. Never again.",Detractor

Check in counter agent was rude, refused to maintain eye contact or answer questions regarding change of seats, continued to engage in conversation with the agent at the next counter and when pressed, replied that his English is poor. I had told him that is unacceptable and that he was rude. He had no response and essentially invited me to file a complaint. I did via on line with Turkish Airlines.

"  Moscow Vnukovo to Istanbul return in economy. Online service was a nightmare, the website is not loading properly, aircraft maps were screwed up, which made it impossible to order the seats you want. On the way to Istanbul the flight was delayed for around an hour with no explanation or apology. The aircraft are clean and modern but the seats are narrow and uncomfortable for a relatively short flight. Personal screens are great, but I found the quality of programming and translation to Russian is poor. Meal service was good, with a choice of alcohol, metal cutlery. The beef was delicious and wine was much better than average, though the presentation of the meal was messy. Cabin crew is generally friendly. The worst part was our return trip to Moscow. We have arrived to Istanbul Ataturk airport to check in 2 hours 40 minutes before the flight only to find out that the flight was overbooked, and we might not be able to fly today. Check-in staff was awful, rude and only acknowledged that she put us on standby when I noticed that our boarding passes didn't have a seat number. She would not offer any solution and just rudely told us to go to the gate, so that maybe someone will not arrive and we will board the plane . After we started arguing the Turkish Airlines representative came and started going about how overbooking flights is legal, and the situation is our problem. This is unbelievable. After some more arguing from our side she made some phone calls and told us the plane will be changed to a bigger one, and she printed our boarding passes. No apologies. The flight was uneventful, but the ground staff attitude to the passengers, and inability to solve problems created by Turkish Airlines in a calm and professional manner makes me want to never fly Turkish Airlines ever again.",Detractor

They have a generous luggage policy, on top of my 31 kg checked in suitcase I was also able to take my skis (around 4 kg with the bag) free of charge. In fact, they have a wide range of sport equipment which one can take for free, however I'm not sure whether you can take it on top of your 32 kg free luggage (or whatever you have if you fly business/first) or whether I just got lucky. I also took on both trips, KUL-VIE and return 3 big pieces of carry on luggage and nobody said anything (although I'm sure this is not their official policy).

"  Dushanbe to Istanbul. I will never fly Turkish Airlines again. I was scheduled to depart early on Saturday morning.

If that were not bad enough the next time they said they would be flying was 2 days later on Monday. But it is now Monday and they have had the better part of two days to deal with the snow and the weather is crystal clear in Dushanbe. But is the flight coming on time? No. It is delayed 5.5 hours, assuming it arrives at all. That has destroyed the rest of my itinerary. I am going to have to spend the night in Istanbul as a result in the best case scenario.

"  Bogota to Rome via Istanbul. We booked the tickets back in early October 2016 for the 5 of us, as part of our once-a-year-trip to Germany. The offers with LH for the direct flight BOG-FRA were not interesting at all. Being a Star Gold Card holder I preferred to travel with a Star Alliance partner, and knowing that TK started to serve BOG in May 2016, I looked for this option, but prices to any German destination were still rather high, so for pure curiosity I went searching the prices for other European destinations. Rome with a very attractive price was the hit, so we decided to fly TK via IST to Italy, staying one night in IST and one night in Rome, before heading on to FRA with a very cheap Alitalia ticket. Bogota to Istanbul has a stop-over in Panama City, and the same flight number back to BOG from IST. So when boarding the plane in BOG we found many passengers originating in Istanbul with Panama as their destination. So the plane was packed on the short flight to Panama, with many passenger leaving the plane in PTY, but not too many passengers boarding to fly to Istanbul. This meant that my wife and myself had a row of 2 seats for ourselves on the way over during this long 13h flight. The service offered by crew was faultless, the food was very good and nicely presented, I would say the best I had in Economy so far. The crew was attentive and willing to help in any case. During the long flight my wife flew into her birthday, and I asked if they can do anything for her. They smiled and promised to arrange a surprise. 20 minutes later they came along with the on-board chef, presenting a cake, nicely prepared with candles and cream saying happy birthday, champagne from Business Class for both of us, and singing happy birthday to her! The plane arrived on time in IST, and we went on the City tour Turkish Airlines offers to their international transfer passengers. This tour is free and takes you to the most important tourist sites in Istanbul, and includes a nice lunch. After the tour ended, the guide stayed in the city with those who were not in a hurry, like us, and took us around some more places. Next morning flight to Rome, with a nicely presented and filling breakfast, better than most Intra-European business class meals on other airlines. Trip back to Colombia in January the same quality on all flights, I was a bit concerned about our luggage due to some comments here about lost baggage, but all arrived safely in BOG. During the 6h layover at AtatÃ¼rk airport we used the Turkish Airlines lounge. A huge place, nicely decorated, with great F&B options, nice showers and some other gimmicks like electronic driving range, pool table, etc - a very good place to easily spend the time and get a nice rest before the very long flight back to BOG. That flight was totally packed, nevertheless the crew again offered a great service. I cannot complain about lack of friendliness and professionalism. Saying that, however, we were lucky enough to travel back to BOG a week after the snow chaos at AtatÃ¼rk airport. Things probably would have been different for us if we had travelled some days earlier. Overall we recommend Turkish Airlines.",Promoter

I could only say that this North America flight has gone downhill in last few years. The plane seemed aged, seats were not comfy, narrow for 10 hours flight. It could be my luck getting an older plane, and it could be different with newer planes for the same route. Check-in to the flight was a complete mess. Instead of calling with zones or Tier everyone invited to open counters, and it caused huge line ups and mess in the plane. Cabin staff was nice, courteous but not helpful. They lied about foods to people especially who were not a native speaker of Turkish. They passed, drinks and food items over passengers heads to their colleague if they were out on their carts. I felt extremely warm in my seat. Complained about it and the answer was this is the coldest they can get at this altitude for maximum air quality in the cabin.

"  Turkish Airlines is nice when everything goes right. However, if something goes wrong they are really terrible. Case in point, I recently flew from Houston to Dubai via Istanbul. Both flights were delayed by an hour. The onboard service was very good on both legs. Onboard the service is of a higher quality than that of US airlines. However, when we arrived into Dubai, all 3 of our bags were missing. Since both flights were delayed over an hour, there was plenty of time to transfer the bags. However, our bags didn't make it and apparently, neither did the bags of some other passengers who originated from Houston. Believe it or not, after a long flight from Houston to Istanbul, upon arrival you do not arrive at a jetway. You arrive at remote parking and have to take a bus to the terminal. This also has an impact on baggage and for this reason alone, I would not recommend Turkish. The resolution of the baggage has been awful. The only way to communicate with TK is via twitter. 2 of our bags have been found but one seems to be completely gone. In this age of barcode bagtags, I just do not see how this happens. I can't recommend anyone take Turkish Airlines based on my experience. They are horrible when anything goes awry.",Detractor

"  Rome to Khartoum via Istanbul. Turkish Airlines customer service extremely chaotic and disorganized, the worst flight experience I have ever had. I realize that the bad weather conditions (snow) was out of the airlines control on the night of 6th January in Istanbul, the service and the little information provided by TK was extremely poor and confusing. Soon after we landed in IST, we were informed that all flights were cancelled due to bad weather conditions. There was no clear information or guidance provided and the few (rude) TK staff members present at Ataturk airport seemed not interested / willing to assist passengers about what to do.

No Amenity bag or flat bed on Edinburgh to Istanbul 4hr 25 mins flight. A 3.5 hour delay on the second leg. The business class lounge staff at the front desk are rude and useless and won't give you information. Nice food and wine in the business class lounge but no comfortable day beds or seats that would allow you to recline in comfort. Istanbul to Cape Town rescheduled but at no point shown as boarding on info screens. At boarding we ended up lumped in with economy passengers again.

Reluctant service. Only 1 loo for business class and this behind the closely guarded and curtained staff section â€“ you were told to get back behind the curtain if you entered the cabin crew space.",Passive
"  Kuala Lumpur to Istanbul return. The food on the flight was some of the worst. I find the cabin staff can be quite surly. However, had a truly awful experience with their customer service during the return flight, Istanbul was hit by blizzards the afternoon of the evening return flight which caused chaos with cancellations of all flights from all Istanbul airports, unfortunate, not much one can do about the weather. What is deplorable is the experience I have had with their customer service. Given the situation as one can imagine the ticket sales/changes queue at the airport was astronomical with everyone trying to rearrange travel arrangements. Spoke with a THY staff member who said I could rearrange over the phone. Waiting for half an over on the phone reached a customer service representative who informed me that as the KL to Perth flight was with a partner airline and THY they could not complete the booking and I had to go in person to the THY ticket office. So I went to the other airport in Istanbul at 3am in a taxi in a blizzard. Upon arriving at the ticket sales office they said they emailed the partner airline but that we would have to wait for a confirmation response. No indication of time frames. We waited for an hour then a different staff member told us that there was no need for us to wait at the airport and that in fact there was no need for us to have come in person to the airport to do this and the call staff had misinformed us. After getting a few hours sleep I then spent half the day repeatedly calling Turkish Airlines chasing any updates. Eventually I was told that in fact we were on standby with the other airline which was strange as the other airlines website was showing tickets for sale. After tearing my hair out eventually I spoke directly with the original booking travel agent who changed the booking no problem wish I had done that sooner rather than wasting my time with THY. Unfortunately the same issue has happened again with the rebooked flight tonight being cancelled due to weather and I am now going through the entire process again. No one can or will give me a telephone number for the ticket sales office instead I am told that I have to get a taxi, drive an hour each way if I'm lucky in the snow and repeat the crazy process of telling the ticket sales office in person exactly what I've told the call centre for them to lodge the booking request with the other airline and then wait until who knows when for them to get back. I have repeatedly asked to speak to a more senior management staff at the call centre to resolve the issue to be told there is no one more senior. Considering the trip was bought as one continuous flight how on earth THY cannot resolve this from their end with the partner airline beggars belief and why on earth one has to physically go to the ticket office to do this seems illogical and hugely inconvenient.",Detractor

To my surprise, a very well organized boarding procedure by TGS at the gate with recorded announcements offering priority for passengers needing assistance and premium flyers. The A321 with the recliner business seats and the touchscreen IFE (including the handheld controller) offers good comfort for a flight that is shy of 4-hours. Pre departure drinks offered with a smile by the Flying Chef. The amenity pouch handed out also adequate considering the duration of the flight. The onboard catering of high quality.

"  Gatwick to Singapore via Istanbul, returning from Bangkok. The outward flight delayed by approximately 30mins due to a problem with a wheel. Most of this time was made up during the flight. Seats on narrow body jet quite comfortable with reasonable recline and seat width. In-flight catering very good for a short flight. Stop at Instanbul not so good mainly because of the long distances in a bus from and too planes. Flight to SIN good with flat bed seats. Cabin crew attentive, but with night flight most passengers selpt for much of the flight. Return from BKK to IST equally good. Flight from IST to LGW similar to outward flight but no vegetarian meal available despite having been ordered. I was surprised by the agrressive manner that this was met by the in-flight chef who appeared to claim it was my fault because I had not ordered a vegetarian meal. The senior cabin crew officer was more understanding and noted my concerns (I had been offered vegetarian food on three of the four legs). Later received an email to tell me that when my original booking had been changed, with the flight being changed by 5 mins, the request had not been updated. At least there was an apology. No entertainment system on this flight 'due to a malfunction'. It is small things such as this that separate the best airlines from the average.

I arrived to Antalya through Istanbul from Lebanon, I was grabbing my baggage and one of the staff approched me to tell me that one of my luggage was broken (something i didnt see), he apologized and proposed two options : money back or a new bag. I chose a new one. I had missed my business flight on my way back to Beirut for whatever reason, one of the staff a girl, was rude and said I have to pay again my ticket. But when I explained the situation to the supervisor on that day, he printed out a new business transfer ticket and replaced the missed one.

"  Los Angeles to Johannesburg return via Istanbul. We had a nightmarish time making our reservation with Turkish Airlines. After reservation was made and tickets were issued, airlines unexpectedly change our flight time, flight date and flight number, and this happened several times. It caused us having to change hotel and other reservations several times, and having to stay at some cities longer (or shorter). Turkish Airlines also did not notify us or the travel agent about the changes. We were lucky enough to find out only because we were making online seat selections They even moved flight #4 in our travel plan earlier than #3, meaning we would arrive in one city, only to find the next flight we were supposed to catch had already left a few days ago. As for the flights themselves, they were ok. Service was ok, a bit inconsistent on some flights. Some planes were older, others are newer. Cabins and bathrooms were clean, seats were comfortable. Food were enjoyable, although quality was a little inconsistent too. In Turkey airports, you do get special privileges for flying with Turkish Airlines Business Class, so that is something to consider if flying to Turkey.",Passive

I asked myself in Istanbul the guy at the gate and got as response that the announced times are merely scheduled times. Seats were okay but nothing special. Strange was the existance of a middle seat in business class on the 777, with zero privacy to the neighbor. Crew was friendly but do not expect refilling of drinks without asking. After dinner you get a bottle of water - if you need more until breakfast you pick it up yourself. Food was good, dessert excellent. Drink selection OK, but I had to beg for alcoholic drinks. Onboard entertainment was very good on the 777, not on the A321. Announcements were kept to a minimum. I would rate the experience below average.",Detractor
"  Bodrum to Istanbul. While the ground staff at the Domestic IST CIP terminal are great in reserving front rows or exit seats for their premium Miles&Smiles members, unfortunately, the TGS ground staff in BJV are the opposite. When I asked politely if I could have a window seat towards the front of the cabin I was handed a boarding card with a seat in the last row with a grin. I then asked if I could do a last minute mileage upgrade. Was first told that it was no problem, then the counter agent contacted her supervisor/colleague which first said that there was availability and that she could process my request but then strangely asked for my name, I could hear the whole conversation over the radio. I guess unless you are a local VIP your commercial value is of little importance. Then suddenly a barrage of invalid excuses followed. First she suggested that my fare class did not allow a last minute upgrade, when I pointed out that was untrue, it was unavailabllity bucket class C, which is also untrue according to M&S rules, finally she said there was a problem with their system, a TGS classic, I was handed out a seat in 6A and did not pursue the matter any further as a line began to form behind me. Not that of a big problem for a 50 minute flight but having had worse problems before, I was reminded once more how TK's ground services and customer service attitude on the ground, bar TK Do&Co, is a total mess.

"  In September 2016 I had a horrible experience with Turkish Airlines. My flight (TK-476) was on 17/09 from Ekaterinburg (Russia) to Barcelona via Istanbul. The time of departure was supposed to be at 7.30 - arriving time to Istanbul at 10.15 and the departure to BCN at 14.40 - so having 4.25 hours would be more than enough to change the plane in Istanbul. Unfortunately the Turkish Airlines delayed the flight in Russia for more than 3 hours. I can understand that there might be some technical problems or something but in that case the company is supposed to ""think"" of its passengers and be more client-oriented which I haven't noticed. The representatives didn't give any explanations regarding the reasons of delay, time of the flight, food, etc. When we finally arrived to Istanbul we still had enough time to catch the plane to BCN (we had 1 hour before the flight) and they could delay the plane for 15-20 min to let us in (I was not the only passenger - we were like 20 people who found themselves in this situation). The only thing they said was ""sorry, you have to wait for the next plane"" (additional 5 hours of waiting). They ignored us and our questions. After that I asked for food and I was given some sort of a coupon which was possible to use only in some places in food court. The cheapest ones, as I realized later. So the only thing I managed to have using this coupon was a bottle of water. Therefore sitting in Istanbul airport waiting for the plane for 5 hours I had to spend my money on normal food in a normal place. For the information: before that in Russia I was waiting for 3 hours and nobody informed me about breakfast so again I had to spend my money on food there. My advice to Turkish Airlines: teach your employees how to communicate with clients and to be more client-oriented.",Detractor

In Istanbul, a separate shuttle for business pax getting them to the terminal before the main crowd. Got a complimentary 5* hotel for my layover, yet had to wait for almost an hour before it was arranged (without any crowd at the desk). Another negative point for ground service - staff at Turkish Airlines lounge in Istanbul was unable to handle any reservation change, been told to go to transfer desk (which is in the arrivals area and would thus need to re-clear security to get back to departures). Istanbul to Buenos Aires a slightly worn Boeing 777, yet full recline seat. Great attentive staff, printed menu, food was great and plentiful - two full services, one light (sandwiches) plus an ample choice of self-service items. Despite a dedicated wine list being presented, had to explicitely request wine, crew never offered it. Free wifi for business passengers is a great plus as well, although the connection was faltering at some moments. Onboard experience was thus almost spotless, ground experience much less so - at Buenos Aires, first priority/business luggage was delivered more than 20 minutes after the delivery started.

Soft skills, understanding of Service and how tired a passenger can be is not the concern of employees. Star Alliance passengers also patronize this lounge which makes it super crowded. Boarding is another mess ground staff creates group to ease the boarding, however it doesnt help at all. Many economy class passengers use Business class lane and this is acceptable by staff.

My complaint is with their Customer service which is abysmal. I needed to delay my departure because my Father-in-law was very ill. They had no Customer Service in India. I called their HQ and even though I selected the English option, they continued to talk in Turkish. I then called the US office (might as well).

If you try to rebook a flight or do your online check-in on the old version the programme will send you into nirvana.

The wifi service is a joke and keeps disconnecting probably from the too large number of people trying to use the service. The planes used to Bogota were old A330s with the old style business class seats which meant no lie flat beds on a 15 hour flight. The crew (it happened to be the same crew on the flight out and back) spoke very little English and semed almost robotic in their behaviour.

The check in experience was relatively easy at Casablanca airport, with no option to fast track at passport control despite the level of Star Alliance membership. Lounge at Casablanca is always busy and offers sandwiches and some hot food sometimes. Flight itself was not a good experience. It is almost a 5 hour flight and the inflight entertainment did not work. The cabin crew were very indifferent and told me there was nothing they could do about it.

"  Istanbul to Almaty return both flights on an old 737-800 rather than normal 737-900 I have experienced on this route before. Outbound flight is an overnight flight and the meal is served early in the flight allowing passengers to sleep for the rest of the journey. Experience was OK apart from the comfort of the seat. Legroom was great as I was in an exit seat, but the seat is very hard which is very uncomfortable for a 5 hour journey. The return flight some days later was on an identical (maybe the same) aircraft. A hot breakfast (that was actually very cold) was served at the beginning of the 6 hour return flight followed by some drinks a few hours later. For such a long journey I would expect a light refreshment to be served towards the latter part of the flight and a hotter meal. On both flights most of the crew were very indifferent and non-caring towards passengers with the exception of some who appeared to be from Kazakhstan who seemed to be smiling and helpful. On descent into Ataturk Airport water started to stream out of the ceiling (perhaps from melting ice) of the plane onto me and the passenger in front of me. We were both seated in exit row seats by the window. It was not possible to get out of my seat at this time as we were so close to landing so I had to use pillows and blankets to cover myself from the water. Due to a bird strike incident with the plane in front of us we had to ascend sharply to make another landing approach. We flew for a further ten minutes before landing safely. Pilot communication during this incident was very acceptable which was pleasing. I advised the flight attendant on exiting about the water leak and my clothing she told me that this sometimes happens - very poor attitude towards customer. In future I'll probably consider another carrier for this route. I was surprised TK use such an older plane on such a long journey and the attitude of their cabin crew. Very disappointing.",Detractor

"  Zurich to Bogota via Istanbul. Turkish Airlines might be the best in Europe due to their good product between Istanbul and European cities but their hard product on long haul routes is very outdated and horrendous. Especially on the A330-200. The planes are old, dirty and the seats often broken. To top it off, the inflight enterntainment did not work on a 13 hour flight. An airline should be consistent and offer the same hard product in C-class across their entire fleet. Their flight attendants are brash and lack the professionalism of other airlines in Star Alliance. I find the food very over-rated, in fact almost everything is almost tacky, starting from the presentation of the menu to the dinner service with the fake candle. This airline lacks the ""finesse"" of its biggest European competitors. When I asked my seat neighbour, who hails from Eastern Europe and now lives in Panama, why he doesn't fly with other airlines, his answer was simply ""I like the price"".

"  Flew from Vienna to Kuala Lumpur via Istanbul. On the positive side, food is excellent, service is attentive and overnight on long distance is a good as it can get on a plane. Transit in Istanbul has been reported as problem by numerous passengers. This is due to outsourcing to TAS Turkish Airport Services which is not part of TK. TK has made efforts to make transit as pleasant as possible in IST, such as allowing transit passengers to access the departure level without going through security control again and providing the most fabluous lounge in the world. If you have a jetty for departure, boarding is a very orderly process. Problems arise when there is no jetty and passengers just scramble into a shuttle. Bagage transit has worked very well even on occasions of short connection. On the negative side TK has grown too fast and also outgrown the available facilities at Ataturk Airport.",Promoter
"Hannover to Dubai via Istanbul. Once again a quite good experience. All 4 flights in time, in two cases landing ahead of schedule. Check in took a bit long in Hannover, and I wonder why online check in is provided but no baggage drop counter. Aircraft all clean, crew was friendly and food for economy class was good. Enterntainment system ok, just the provided headphones are not very comfortable. Transfer in Istanbul on both ways efficient. Can recommend Turkish Airlines, not sure if they are Europes number one but for sure they are among the best.",Promoter
"  This is the first time we have flown with Turkish Airlines and it was superb. Check in was quick and easy as was the priority fast track and boarding. On board the first flight the crew were friendly, helpful and attentive. The seats wide and comfortable and the food and wines excellent. The lounge in Istanbul was large but with plenty of seating and a wide choice of freshly cooked food and snacks. Not that we ate having had a delicious lunch. We boarded the plane to Mauritius and were immediately impressed by the welcome, the cleanliness and the comfort of the cabin. Straight after take off the Chef (yes they have an on board chef) came round with the dinner menu. Pre dinner drinks were served with small bowls of nuts and olives to be followed by a variety of hot and cold canapÃ©s served from the trolley. Our tray tables were beautifully set and dinner was served with all the little extra chefs touches just like in a first class restaurant. After an truly wonderful meal the cabin crew asked could they make up our beds. A bed pack was produced with mattress pillows and duvet. Our seats then became fully flat beds and I had a restful night. Having already chosen our breakfast we were wakened to yet another lovely meal. Arrival was on time and our baggage arrived quickly We had the same experience on our return flights nothing was too much trouble for the excellent staff. Having travelled to Mauritius many times in British Airways business class and experienced the scruffy aircraft and the lack of service, travelling with Turkish Airlines was a breath of fresh air much more @like being-in first class. I cannot recommend Turkish Airlines highly enough and look forward to travelling with them again. Turkish Airlines deserves 5*.",Promoter
"  Bangkok to Venice via Istanbul. New planes on both legs with the latest hard product, excellent food as usual. Flight attendants on the Istanbul to Venice segment were among the best I have ever had on a flight: young, polite, very professional, smiling. Turkish Airlines remains my only choice of travel between Europe and Asia.",Promoter
"Service on board was excellent, perhaps in part due to the fact that the business cabin was at most half occupied. The flight from Chicago to Istanbul is a evening/night flight, so we were first served a dinner and then the flight attendants made up the lie-flat bed. One really has to commend Turkish for the excellent, restaurant quality food they serve on board. Also a good selection of beverages. Flight attendants provided excellent service. One negative which I experienced last year with Turkish as well. On landing in IST, we did not dock at a gate, but parked out on the tarmac, which means one has to walk down stairs and then take a bus to the terminal. This is really unacceptable for a major international flight.",Promoter
"  Dar es Salaam to London via Istanbul. I was on an overnight flight from Dar es Salaam departing at 03.25 to arrive at Attaturk Airport at 10.25 later that morning. The plane was an old model and the seats did not recline completely. Sleep was not easy. One of the stewardess's in the business section could barely speak English, was unable to make herself understood and spent a lot of time opening & shutting overhead compartments in the business section, making it difficult for me to sleep (I was in seat 2B). My problem arose at Attaturk Airport when, only having a 2 hour layover, I chose to go to the business class lounge to relax until the connecting flight to London. However, I fell asleep and woke 20 minutes before take off. What I hadn't realised was that the gate was a 25 minute walk from the lounge and though I ran I made it to the gate only to be told the gate had closed, that I would need to go to the information desk to get another ticket for an alternative flight to London. When asked for instructions to the information desk, I was given incorrect information as to how to get there. Every member of the ground staff I asked told me a different direction, and were most unhelpful. Eventually I was told I needed to go to the transfer department - again given incorrect directions. Finally when I spoke to a member of staff there, he told me I had to go to the ticket office as he could not issue a ticket for me. Again, I was given incorrect directions to the ticket office. Back to information, who told me I had to go through passport control. When I got there I was told I needed a visa. Why? After all I'm airside, I'm not leaving the airport - no one had the courtesy to tell me that the only place I could buy a new ticket was outside the transit area. Again, I was given incorrect directions to the visa desk. I purchased a visa that cost me Â£20, went through passport control and eventually managed to find the ticket office. Again, I was met by very surly ticket office sales staff who were most unhelpful and who tore up my boarding pass & suggested I would have to pay a further Â£1050 for a business class ticket or Â£435 for a single economy ticket. She suggested if I wanted to try to buy one cheaper, I could do so online. When asked what the Wi-Fi code was, I was told there wasn't any. Having no alternative but to buy the economy ticket, I was then told to go to the incorrect check in desk! Standing in line for ages, when I got to the desk, I was told I had to go to 'C' section. Finally I came across the one and only helpful staff member, who understood my predicament, was sympathetic and helped me through the process of locating my luggage (which had obviously been off loaded from the original aircraft I was supposed to be on) and assured me it would be on the flight I was now booked on. I was aware that I had a restricted ticket and would therefore forfeit the ticket for a no show, or cancellation etc, however, what I did not expect was the rudeness and unhelpfulness from Turkish Airlines ground staff. I certainly would never book with Turkish Airlines again. It was a nightmare.",Detractor
"  Birmingham to Cape Town via Istanbul and Durban. BHX to IST a comfortable B737-800 with fairly good leg space. Food was okay. Cabin crew weren't very enthusiastic. IFE was a bit difficult to work as touch screen wasn't very responsive. Choice of movies was okay. Was shocked to see many passengers get up to collect their cabin luggage while plane was still taxiing on arrival in Istanbul and cabin crew did nothing except tell them to sit down over the speaker. Istanbul to Cape Town via Durban a new A330-300, much better IFE although seat would not recline and very uncomfortable for a 12 hour flight to CPT, including a 1 hour layover in Durban. Fortunately we did not have to disembark in Durban. Food quality was the same as previous flight. Appreciated the amenities (toothbrush, socks.etc) given on this long haul flight as this is not always provided for on other airlines. Cabin crew friendlier on this sector. Flight was punctual on arrival in CPT. Return flight CPT-IST via Durban on an A330-300. More experienced crew and friendlier than previous flights. Same food quality and almost exactly same menu. IST to BHX on a B737-800. Boarding was disorganized and painfully slow which caused a slight delay in the flight. Lack of adequate airport facilities at Istanbul a contributing factor. Same breakfast served as on previous flight. Overall, not a great experience but considering it was cheapest ticket available I accept the outcome. Service and product quality nowhere near as advertised. Food menu was repetitive on all flight and cabin crew not always professional with not very fluent English.",Detractor
"  Johannesburg to Montreal via Istanbul. Check in at JNB was uneventful. Turkish Airlines uses the SAA lounge which is pretty ordinary but food choices are extensive. Boarding was delayed due to late arrival of the inbound aircraft but was conducted in an orderly manner. Onboard, the aircraft looked well kept and the FA's were friendly and spoke very good English. Food and wine quality were good but I would have liked to have a few South African wines. Dinner and drink service was very slow and it took us over three hours to get to desert once we were airborne. The aircraft on the JNB-IST leg did not have wifi and although the IFE had a large selection of movies, it was on the skinny side when it came to new releases. Flight landed on time and with almost every flight we were bussed to the terminal. Spent a few hours in the Istanbul lounge which is well and truly an amazing experience with a very large array of food and beverage offerings. Boarding on the second leg was absolutely chaotic and TK should be ashamed of putting their premium passengers through that ordeal. Once again we were bussed to the aircraft. The second A330 was brand new and the crew and their service were outstanding. I felt pampered throughout the 10 hour flight and was able to catch 3 hours of very comfortable rest in the lie flat seats. The WiFi on the second leg did not work despite the pursers countless efforts to get it up and running. The food on the second leg was superior to the first which likely was related to catering being done out of TK's hub in Istanbul. The flight landed on time but the luggage delivery was slow with priority bags coming out towards the end. Turkish offers a very good business class product on long-haul routes and I would not hesitate to use them again. They must however improve boarding and gate arrangements in IST which are deplorable.",Promoter
"Venice to Kuala Lumpur via Istanbul, first flight an overbooked A321 flight. As an Elite member, I was upgraded to Business class at the gate. I appreciate the 2-2 Business class configuration Turkish Airlines has on most of their A321s. It makes the difference compared to other European carriers. Meals were gorgeous as usual, champagne generously available. The chef on board was nice and attentive, otherwise service was a bit rushed. Istanbul to Kuala Lumpur on a new A330-300. Quite low load factor on this segment, I had the chance to take two emergency seats all for myself. Service in general very good, had a long chat with cabin crew at the back of the plane, they seemed nice and friendly. My suitcase arrived in Malaysia damaged but it was picked-up at my place, repaired and delivered back by Turkish Airlines itself in less than 24 hours.",Promoter

Sao Paulo to Bangkok via Istanbul with Turkish Airlines. In the last 3 weeks they have changed our flights 5 times with just an email notification. No change to connecting flights so if I didn't call there would be no connecting flight. Their customer service act like they are doing you a favour by changing flights. No response to a complaint made via the internet 2 weeks ago. I have used over 20 airlines and this company appears to be the Fawlty Towers of airlines. First and last time I book with them. It takes over one month to receive a refund if you don't want to change flight times every few days. I believe you have to call Turkey for this to hopefully happen.,Detractor
"  Heathrow to Antalya via Istanbul. I booked our flight with Turkish Airlines months in advance. Flight times changed and I made to contact to customer services (cannot be done on their website) to book the new time schedule. I had great trouble to understand their English. Once you book your tickets, you need to fill a form called APIS, to be able to check in and print the boarding pass. We tried this online many times, it got to a point that I wanted to cancel the flights. I had to contact their customer services but again, no luck to talk to anyone who can speak English clearly. We travelled to the airport to sort the problem and book our seats. Our flight was delayed 2 hours, found out at the airport. This caused further problem as we had a transfer flight from Istanbul to Antalya. We were dumped at the Istanbul Ataturk airport, no one there to tell us where to go or what to do. I speak Turkish so we could find our way and helped others. We needed to pass security points, walked almost 1 hour to get to the international to domestic side. But the domestic flight delayed too and we arrived there at 12:35 midnight to find that one of the luggage was left in Istanbul. We waited until 1:45 at their customer services to be told that it was not their problem, it was Istanbul. After long discussion we were told that they would send our luggage the next day. We waited all day for the luggage to arrive. It arrived at night and we wasted a day. I rather use a budget airline and avoid this airline.",Detractor
"Amman to Toronto via Istanbul. Going to Amman meant a 10 hours stop over and then back to Toronto a 9.45 hour stop over, both ways we flew business which should mean a hotel or at a 2 hour room in the business lounge where you can catch a nap and a shower. Both ways we were refused hotel or a 2 hour room. We were not alone - the same was happening to people flying to and from Johannesburg. It seems Turkish Airlines are offering flights with long stop overs and not giving the consumers the option of shorter stop overs then trapping them at Istanbul airport. This airport has some of the most over inflated duty free shops I've ever seen. Research the flights carefully even though Turkish Airlines are not offering shorter stop overs when puting your from and to destinations, there are and people are being forced to spend more than half a day in Istanbul airport. This is not right. I've been travelling 8 hours and still another 8 hours before catching a 14 hour flight to Canada.",Detractor

"  Kilimanjaro to London Heathrow via Istanbul. My route on the way to Tanzania wasn't too bad, although my friends bag did get lost. On the way home it was a terrible 24 hours. We got to Kilimanjaro airport early and then when it came to check in three people from my group including myself weren't on the list to fly! We had to wait till after check in had closed for someone to drive to the airport with a different list, during this time we were told nothing we had no idea if we would definitely be on that flight. We finally got through and then very quickly had to go through security again and wait to board. We had a two hour wait even though our plane had arrived - we got given no information. I hadn't had a drink in over 4 hours due to the fact you can't take liquids into the airport and then the only place I could buy a drink I was only there for a minute until I had to move again into somewhere we couldn't take liquids. They had moved some people up to business class and then after about an hour took in everyones tickets and got them reprinted, back to economy. Finally once we were on and then arrived at Istanbul, due to the fact we were 2 hours late one of my friends travelling with us had missed her next flight. Throughout the whole journey she was asking for help, she was literally on the back seat of the plane and wouldn't allow her to be one of the first to get off so she was the last person off. We then had to wait for a bus to take us to the airport. Once there we tried to find someone to help her, she asked someone who sent her to somewhere you go if you didn't have a boarding pass - this wasn't the issue (causing her to be even later). We asked 5 people at the airport for help and the staff were all rude saying 'I'm busy' and walking off. Eventually we found someone who told her where to go but it was too late she had missed her flight. I then got on my next plane to Heathrow, once landed at 4.30 I went to collect my luggage, I waited an hour and a half for them to then say 'That's all the bags.' Which meant 6 out of 7 people I was with didn't have their rucksacks. We all went over to lost luggage and there we got told all our bags weren't on the flight and that they were on the next flight coming from Istanbul. If we had been told this earlier it wouldn't have been as big an issue yet we waited an hour and half and parking at an airport isn't cheap! There was no communication at all. We got told we could wait till the next flight came in which was gone 9 in the evening or get our bags delivered to us in a few days. I opted for getting my bag delivered as my parents would have had to pay a fortune on parking else. Not happy at all, such a long tiring day with no communication.

"  Montreal to Istanbul on Turkish Airlines. Check-in was handled by a ground agent and not a Turkish Airlines staff. It was a little slow as I wanted my bag checked only to Istanbul and not my final destination. Turkish uses an affiliated lounge in Montreal which was packed with standing room only so I left and walked over to the Air Canada lounge which was very quiet. Boarding was slow with business and coach passengers processed at the same time but through different queues. On top of it, passengers were kept waiting in the jetway as the crew was not ready. Onboard the aircraft looked newish. The FA's were courteous and spoke decent English. The lie-flat seat was comfortable but narrow and the crew turned into a bed by using a mattress and duvet. Service was prompt and food and beverages including champagne were of high quality. IFE had a rich selection of movies and the screen was a decent size. Wi-Fi connectivity was great.

"  On 16th July, some hours after the coup attempt in Turkey, I went to the Munich airport expecting that my flight to SFO with a stop in Istanbul would be cancelled, but for my surprise, at the check-in I was informed by the Turkish Airline staff that the situation in Turkey was normal and that my flight from Istanbul to San Francisco was confirmed. So I got the flight to Istanbul but the situation I found at the airport was terrible. A lot of flights were cancelled. I found out that my flight to SFO was delayed by 5 hours, so I went to the gate and waited there. Then, after 5 hours waiting, they announced that all flights on that day were cancelled and asked passengers to go out of the terminal and ask for a hotel in the Turkish Airlines desk. I went out of the airport but my luggage was not in the baggage carrousel. I went to the hotel desk and they asked everybody there to enter in a bus and we were taken to a hotel. There a Turkish Airlines staff told me that my luggage will be delivered to the hotel and that my flight to SFO was confirmed to the next day. At the next day, we discovered that all flights from Turkey to USA were cancelled and we should wait another day. At the second, the flight was again cancelled, so I was given the option to return to Munich and request a refund of the flight to SFO. So I returned to Munich, but my luggage was lost (they didn't deliver it at the hotel as promised). I filed a report for lost baggage at my arrival at the Munich airport on 18th July and as instructed, I opened a complaint on the Turkish Airlines site on 25th July. Since then I didn't receive any response (40 days without any contact!). I tried to contact the company by telephone, e-mail or via their feedback system, but nothing.

On time departure and orderly boarding. 2x2 business seating, IFE and much appreciated quality catering. While flying in a metal tube with little distractions it is nice to be served a nice meal. The onboard chef was attentive and the chicken papillotte was very good. One can even enjoy a cup of Turkish coffee afterwards. Scheduled arrival into IST.

The ground TGS staffs at business check-in counter at SAW airport has poor or no English knowledge and not communicating / speaking at all. TK should standardize the product and service and should offer and have in all airplanes same business and/or economy seats.

"  Niamey to London Heathrow via Istanbul. What a hectic night. We sat on the plane on the tarmac for two and a bit hours because they lost an oxygen tank and couldn't find a new one. They then cancelled our flight and stuck us back in the terminal. Then the heavens opened. Obviously the best option was to stick 200 grumpy passengers outside in the thunder, lightning and rain. Next, they took us 4 at a time in taxis to an hotel. My wife and I were put into what appeared to be the remnant of a much hated Toyota Corrolla. We hung out there for a bit with a guy who spoke no English whatsoever. Once he left us alone in his car and we realised we were going nowhere we accosted a man with a Turkish airlines jacket in a dark car park (still raining). He put us on a bus which proceeded to tour Niamey at 3:00am with the AC on full blast which helped our wet cloths become much more effective in helping us contract some illness. Finally after messing about for a total 6 hours, at 4:00am we got a hotel which makes faulty towers look like New York's Waldorf hotel. There we were left in the hands of the Receptionist. What he lacked linguist ability and clarity of speech he made for in volume and repetition. Needless to say information about our fate was lacking. At around around 7:30am a rumour spread that our suffering may end by 8:00pm that evening. Finally at 8:00pm we were herded into a bus and taken to the airport. There, the Turkish Airlines staff directed us to line up and walk around Niamey airport. At the departure gate our boarding passes and baggage tags were handed out. Once we finally boarded the aircraft most of us passed out with exhaustion for the rest of our journey. Needless to say this is a journey we will not forget in a hurry.",Detractor
"  Booked a flight from Bologna to Los Angeles via Istanbul. First flight was cancelled because of the coup. We ask at the ticket sales and they say everything ok and provide a new ticket for the day after. We arrive in Istanbul and sleep there for one night waiting for the second flight the next morning. As we arrive at the airport we learn all flights to USA have been cancelled again. We go to the ticket sales where a woman finds us a new flight from Istanbul to Frankfurt and a Lufhtansa flight from Frankfurt to LAX, the day after again. One more night in Istanbul. At the check-in counter I'm told they can't check us in for both flights, ""Because we are two different companies"". They say we have to get the luggage back in Frankfurt and check-in again with Lufthansa. Luggage is not in Frankfurt, I ask for information at the baggage claim and they explain to me when luggage is in transit it's kept in transit 'til the final destination. We move to the departures terminal and check-in again, but there's no seat number on the boarding pass. As we arrive at the gate we find out that the Turkish Airlines employee had jut put us on a waiting list. Boarding refused. We go back to the TK ticket sales and after two hours they manage to find us a new flight for the day after. We ask for our luggage, as we have been wearing the same clothes for 3 days and we find out the luggage is not in Frankfurt at all, as it's been never loaded on our flight from Ataturk. We make a claim (fortunately the German personnel is far more professional than the personnel in Ataturk). They say the luggage will be sent to LAX with the next flight from Ataturk. The day after we finally fly to LAX with a LH flight. Luggage is not there. Another claim, they say to come back the day after because TK made another mistake and sent the luggage to Frankfurt.

"  We flew from Los Angeles to Geneva via Istanbul. Flight from LAX to IST was full and while the catering, inflight entertainment and cabin staff service were good, the impression that remained from this flight was the lack of leg room for such a long haul flight. I'm 1m 80 and my wife 1m 76, which has nothing exceptional in the European population and despite having removed all brochures from the seat pockets in front of us, our knees in a normal seating position were touching the seats in front of us (that were not even inclined). We battled during this 12h30 flight to find the most confortable position without success. A real pity that TK accomodate maximum seats in Economy despite very good 9 seats abreast configuration on this 777-300 (vs 10 for many other airlines). Like many European travelers, we have been attracted to Turkish Airlines by their competitive prices (around 50% cheaper than AF, BA, LH, LX when we booked to the ticket early April), their enviable reputation of Best European Airline by Skytrax for several years in a row and their staff reliability (no strikes recorded during the last few years compare to AF/LH for instance). Transit via IST was OK while extremely crowded highlighting again the dramatic need for TK to operate from the new airport under construction. Flight from IST to GVA was fine (A320) without leg room issues). Ground service was inexistant during the transit and we were finally all packed at Gate 306 with no seating capacity available at the boarding gate given the crowd.",Detractor
"  July 15th, 2016 I flew from Oslo to Manila via Istanbul. We landed normally on time, July 15th, 11pm in Istanbul for a short transfer for the next flight - but that was not to be. Leaving the plane we noticed there was no personnel from Turkish Airlines to be seen. After walking around looking for the gate for the connecting flight we started to feel something was wrong. And it was. The airport was closed (we were the last flight in) and the military coup was in progress. Since there was absolutely no information coming from the airport or Turkish Airlines personnel we had to rely on rumors and twitter to discover what was going on. In short order, here are the events as they unfolded: No personnel from Turkish Airlines was to be seen or heard from in any form from 11pm July 15th until 2pm July 16. They left thousands of transit passengers stranded without food, water or information. No information whatsoever was at any time given to us before the following day 2pm. The transfer desk and information desk was at all times left unmanned. After 14 hours my flight was cancelled. Over the speakers we were given the option to either travel to Turkish Airlines HQ in Istanbul city centre, or call their call center (all lines busy). It was complete chaos. I ended up having to go online and buy a new one-way ticket out of Istanbul. Travel Tip: Find another airline.",Detractor
"  I flew from Munich - Istanbul and back. I think, Turkish Airlines are in fact the best European Airline. I also fly a lot with LH or KLM/AF (in Economy). You can't compare them with TK. The airplane seemed to be new. Both flights were with an A321. On both ways, there was IFE with a large choice of different international movies and documentaries. Never seen this before on an A321 or/and on short-haul. The flight time was enough to watch one movie. However, When you watched a movie and had your earphones on, the cabin announcements were so loud. Food was delicious. At first you get a turkish delight. For the meal, you could choose between Turkish meat-balls and something with chicken. I had the meat-balls which was great. Alcoholic drinks were free. I took a beer and a freshly squeezed orange juice. The staff were nice. Seat comfort is ok. I'm 5ft. 10in. I had enough space to the front and for my legs. The space to my neighbour was fine.

"  I often fly Turkish Airlines economy class, but this time I flew business class Istanbul-Riga-Istanbul. Turkish Airlines is my favorite airline, but business class exceeded all my expectations. In Istanbul Ataturk airport I could check-in and use the business class passage for migration/security control - which is very valuable in such a busy and crowded airport. Moreover, Turkish Airlines lounge is free of charge for business class passengers. The seats in the business class are wide and comfortable with ability to transform a seat to bed-like resting position. The in-flight entertainment is wonderful - from many new movies, channels, series, etc. Inflight service is excellent with very attentive flight attendants. The meal service was simply fantastic - bext to appetizers, there is a selection of 3 possible main course choices (but I did not like any of them (veal, shrimp, vegetarian), so I was offered extra choice of chicken - to my own surprise). I highly recommend this airline even with economy clas, and its business class is a delight.",Promoter
  Istanbul to Zurich. Lounge and fast track access at IST convenient and at a high standard. Ground services provider TGS also on good behavior. On time boarding with priority implemented for families and status/business Pax. Warm greeting by crew and informative announcement from the flight deck in good English. Proper 2x2 business class seats with on demand IFE and a wide range of content. The 3-course onboard catering very good as usual. Cabin crew could be a little more proactive with refills. Landed ahead of schedule at ZRH. Turkish Airlines is providing a very competitive product and premium product compared to other European Carriers.,Promoter
"  Istanbul to Odessa. Turkish Airlines are a godsend if you need to get to Yemen or Kyrgyzstan. They have a relatively new fleet of planes and an amazing business lounge at Istanbul. However I must warn that this veneer of modernity can disappear quickly if you have any travel issues whatsoever. Lying beneath the surface is a bureaucratic organization and your connection through Istanbul will not be like your connection through Munich. Surly staff, grimy bathrooms, and general discomfort. If you miss a flight and have to stay overnight, you may have the full Turkish experience. So, if you need to get to Tehran in a hurry, Turkish is your best choice.",Detractor
Flew from Tokyo Narita to Malaga via Istanbul. Flight departure was 2230 but at the airport I was told the fight was leaving at 2200. Narita is very far from the town so people arrive early anyway. Flight time was longer so maybe they were anticipating head winds. Very friendly and hard working crew on a full flight. There was a lot of turbulence with the crew having to sit for a lot of it but the cabin atmosphere was very calm. I have no complaints at all about Turkish Airlines onboard service but the IST ground handling staff let them down as they are miserable and unfriendly (NRT of course where good but that is Japanese customer service).,Promoter
"  Flew Turkish Airlines from Miami to Istanbul. Positive things were: the plane looked really nice, every passenger has a screen in front of him/her with a lot of movies, the drinks are free. Negative things were: there isn't enough space for your legs when you are 185 cm tall and the food was not good enough (taste, variety).",Passive

At the gate it appeared that they printed the wrong boarding pass for us which complicated security for us and caused us to lose the bassinet seat after all of this.

The good start was when I was informed that the airline upgrade itself my seat from economy to business class. I was surprised. When I first got in the aircraft I observed that the Business cabin room was great. There are 2 seats in every side instead of the 3x3 (with a vacant seat in the middle) which is the average. The seat space was quite comfortable, the meal was tasty and I also enjoyed the beverages (fresh orange juice, a home-made lemonade and a glass of white wine).

I was expecting some disarray on the ground and in the cabin but everything went smoothly. I wanted to write this review to express my gratitude to the cabin crew. The flight was TK0177 on July 19, 2016. This group of attendants were the best I have encountered in a long time, on all the flights I took in the last few years. They were eager to make our experience a pleasant one and they succeeded. Their service was efficient with a smile, and with great attention to detail. I am happy with Turkish Airlines in general but what makes it exceptional is the existence of such employees that elevate boring and long flights to outright enjoyable.",Promoter
"  I had a return flight Brussels-Dakar via Istanbul. I got my flight Brussels-Istanbul on 15 July. However, due to the political situation in Turkey, my flight Istanbul-Dakar on 16 July was cancelled and I was stuck at Ataturk Airport. After queuing for 7h30, I was informed there would be no flight to Dakar for the next three days and was sent to another desk. After another 1h I was informed there was a flight to Dakar the day after, but the boarding flights were printed with mistakes. On 17 July, Turkish Airlines put me on a flight back to Brussels. Therefore, I have never used my partial tickets Istanbul-Dakar and Dakar-Istanbul and they have committed on their website to refund these tickets. However, they are now making it a nightmare to claim back. Throughout the situation, no communication was provided to travellers, staff assistance was poor (the first food provided arrived after more than 10h), and even now the support provided is just not acceptable. There was never an apologies or concerned expressed. You do not want to be stuck in Turkey in the middle of a military coup and have to depend on them.",Detractor
"My partner and I were on flight TK53 from Tokyo to Istanbul and were due to get a connecting flight home to Dublin (TK1975). Approximately 2 hours before we landed, we saw live TV coverage of the Coup from Istanbul and waited for updates from cabin crew. An hour later, the pilot announced that we would not be landing in Istanbul due to ""operational reasons"". This was the one and only announcement given until 12 hours later. We landed in Antalya and were brought into a working terminal. We sat and waited patiently. At 6am, we were bussed to another terminal - an unused, abandoned terminal with no facilities or options to get food and very little air con on what was an extremely warm morning. There were no reps from Turkish Airlines, there was no WIFI, there was no communication of any sort. At midday, a cafe was opened and food served at high prices. The free food of water and bread became tiresome as that was our only option since landing at 4am. At 8pm we were informed our flight would be returning to Istanbul and there we would be met by reps who would transfer our boarding passes. We were assured all would run smoothly and we would have the option of getting a hotel for the night. Upon arrival at Istanbul, we joined the queue for the transfer desk. It took 6.5 hours to reach the top of the queue - no reps, nobody to answer questions, no customer service whatsoever. When we finally got to the desk, we were met by staff members who were more interested in updating their Facebook Status' rather than helping the customers standing in front of them. There was no sense of concern or apology.",Detractor
"  Flew New York JFK to Brussels via Istanbul. Turkish Airlines was great, definitely recommend. The food was very good for economy class - I ordered vegetarian meals, which are almost always bland and generally awful, but I had no complaints. They seemed rather sophisticated and quite tasty for airline food, and you actually eat with real, metal utensils. The seats were comfortable enough (probably the most average portion of the flight), and my transatlantic flight had TVs (as expected for a 10-11 hr flight) with good selection, and my shorter flight (4 hrs) had overhead TVs that were available for everyone to watch. Best part of Turkish, though, is that they really do take care of you. On my transatlantic voyage, they provided a package with slippers/blanket/sleep mask/headphones/toothbrush and more. The bathrooms had real flowers in them, and they came around many times with food and drink - first with Turkish Delight, then with a different cake, then with dinner, then coffee/tea, then breakfast, then coffee/tea a second time). Overall, great experience. Clean, comfortable planes, really good prices, quite good food, and it seems a genuine care for passengers.",Promoter
"  I flew with Turkish Airlines from London Heathrow to Seoul via Istanbul on the 28th of June. During check in for the bag drop, I found that my seat reservation had been changed, unknowingly, which was a disappointment considering I had reserved my seats with the company via telephone. Upon taking my seat and checking out the IFE I found that the Map screen wasn't working at all, which was another disappointment, I'd seen one person call the flight attendant asking her the same thing. The entertainment, meaning the music and movie selection was good but not great. Nothing that was particularly new. We were given Turkish Delight as soon as all the passengers were settled down - it was A nice unique touch to their service. The flight attendants were dressed smartly and were attentive, however, looked moody and tired. The food service was brilliant. I chose the pasta option and it was very good. The side dishes accompanying it were very good also. Their Homemade Lemonade with Mint was really refreshing. The flight was proceeding ahead as normal until we landed and were at the gate ready to disembark the aircraft. We were told to take our seat's because the airport authorities wouldn't let us off. We were not aware of the issues at Istanbul's Ataturk Airport. The crew didn't mention it to us but people slowly started to find out. We were held on the plane for 6 hours, without any food - water was available but the crew had run out of cups which made it difficult for people to stay hydrated. After disembarking the plane via stairs, we were rushed off into Terminal Buses to take us to the airport entrance, once it was safe. By this time it was 2am and I had missed my connecting flight. It was canceled due to the incident - all flights were. The amount of stranded passengers in the terminal was overwhelming, and to see that no Turkish Airlines staff were there to assist us with the queries we all had was shocking. In incidents like these, when these things happen staff should be there to assist with the backlog of passengers. I ended up waiting until 9am for the information desk to open to re-book my flight to Seoul. When I finally got on the flight to Seoul, the service was immaculate. Everything worked and the flight was great. We were given Turkish Delight and Hot Towels, including complimentary amenity kits and a menu which clearly stated what the meal options were. Snacks anytime you wanted and the flight attendants regularly came with drinks to keep everyone quenched. The flight attendants were attentive and friendly and it was generally a pleasurable flight. The only thing I'd say having been on two flights was that I felt we were being treated like royalty on the longer long haul flights and less attended to on the shorter ones i.e London to Istanbul - we didn't get hot towels or much attention. Overall their in-flight service is very good, food is top notch, however, their ground staff could do with more training in customer management.",Passive

The aircraft was clean and fresh, as well as the cabin crew. The seat was comfortable and the temperature inside the aircraft was set to a perfect one for me. The food was also very nice and delicious. However, the food tray did not sit properly on the table. The bottom side of the tray was not flat (it might be deformed due to the heat from previous meals) so it moved every time I used a knife or spoon on the food. It happened on all the four flights. The cabin crew and ground staff were very kind and polite. The inflight Entertainment was excellent, but the touchscreen (on some aircraft) was not as responsive as I expected.

"Our first trip with Turkish Airlines. We had chosen this carrier, because it had the best flight schedule for flights out of Stuttgart to Mauritius. Flights STR-IST/ IST-STR on A321, IST-MRU / MRU-IST on A330. Planes new and in very good condition. All flights were (more or less) on time. Transfer in Istanbul on outbound flight was easy and quick. Unfortunately online check-in for return flight from MRU to IST was not possible and we had to collect our boarding pass for the leg IST to STR at Transfer Desk in IST and therefore had to queue for a while. On all flights very good service. Great variety of drinks. Full meal even on the legs STR-IST / IST-STR. On longhaul legs 2 full meals with choices and sandwich service throughout entire flight. Amenity kit offered on both longhaul legs. Great IFE system with a large selection of movies, TV shows, music and Live TV. Legroom in Economy is not very good. Felt a little cramped. For larger persons it can get uncomfortable, Luckily flights were not full, so we were able to spread out and find some sleep. Friendly crew members. Overall a good experience.

On the main leg from Istanbul to San Francisco, we received complimentary trousses (yes, in the economy class) two full meals + free availability of sandwiches and beverages, my kids received other dedicated gifts and trousses. Meals were generally good, even the pasta was good. The Flight Entertainment System maybe needs some adjustments: the games keep freezing, so I had to ask to the staff (really friendly and responsive) to restart at least three time the display of one on my sons. We did the online check-in, so we had a dedicated counter fro baggage drop-off at check-in, avoiding the queues of the economy class. Unfortunately, in seat map shown during online check-in the presence of the baby bassinettes was not indicated, so I discovered it only during the flight, not so comfortable. Moreover, the website is not so user friendly, it is impossible to select a special meal for example. Conclusion: Airline, staff and services really OK.

I was worried initially about the relative short transfer time in Istanbul especially since this was a short business trip but I was very pleasantly surprised, all flights were exactly on time which is a first for me with Turkish Airlines. Onboard the service was pretty good with decent food especially since the flights were relatively short. Business class with the A320 is your luck of the draw, on one of the 3 flights in this aircraft type business class was simply an economy seat with the middle seat left empty as is the case with European airlines. This is unfair to passengers who are paying a lot of money only to end up in an economy seat, on the A330 it is a completely different experience with a massive seat, tons of privacy and space an altogether different experience.

The best I have tasted in a long time and we are frequent travelers. The planes were all very full.

Thunder storm so flight delayed by an hour. Rushed service. The usual hot towels and Turkish delight offered. No champagne offered as usual, only lemonades so you feel greedy by asking for the Taiitinger. IFE is enclosed in armrests so it makes you feel slightly cramped, especially when meal tray is open. This flight, to and from MAN and IST feels like a cheap relation compared to long haul flights out of Turkey. Ground crew misdirected us twice when attempting to go through security.

They said we can expect to receive our luggage within 3-4 business days because they will need to put it on a United Airlines flight to San Antonio to get it us. While they are not confrontational, they just pretend that you do not exist after you make a request to be upgraded.

"Singapore to Brussels via Istanbul, returning from Berlin. To Brussels, everything ran like clockwork and a satisfactory experience. Food and entertainment were on par with other carriers. But when things go wrong, TK falls apart. A technical fault delayed my flight back from Berlin. Initially, the delay was announced to be 90 minutes, meaning many passengers would miss connections in IST, including myself. The fate of transit passengers was left to the transfer desk in IST, as TXL ground staff refused to do anything. This was extremely nerve-racking because my connecting flight to SIN operated only daily, so I would have had to stay overnight in IST if I missed it. When I explained the situation and asked to be re-booked from TXL, ground staff rejected my request, and said they could do nothing nor provide any information on my connecting flight. Several transit passengers were frustrated over the lack of answers resulting in arguments with ground staff. There were further delays during boarding, and no explanations or revised departure time was provided. Eventually, the flight left 2.5 hours late. In IST, transfer desk said SIN flight was over 4 hours late. Why couldn't the ground staff in TXL tell me this?

"  London Gatwick to Mombasa with Turkish Airlines. TK currently have rock-bottom fares (around Â£1300 return to MBA from LGW). Arrival / departure times are inconvenient which may be a contributing factor. TK use the new Number 1 lounge at LGW. The â€˜onboard chef' on TK flights is a lot of fuss about nothing. The â€˜chef' on the first short sector to IST is simply a flight attendant in a chef's hat who serves the drinks and most of the food. There was no chef on the long-haul sector. The food offering was excellent on both flights. There is a Turkish flair to the menu (Mezze, Turkish coffee, Turkish wines), however there is enough to choose from to please the less adventurous palate. The seat is clearly the reason that the lower fares are currently offered on the route. The seats are not flatbed. They are similar to most airline's Premium Economy seat offer. Good leg-room, a foot rest and good recline. Other than that a normal medium haul business class seat. If I was paying the fare BA or KQ charge on the route I would have something to grumble about, but I am not â€“ so did not. Everyone talks about the lounge at IST. It certainly is large, and impressive with self-service bars throughout, deli-style counters with sweets, cakes and savoury options. The pizza chefs, BBQ chefs, pasta chefs cook for the streams of passengers queuing for them. There is a virtual golf range, scalextric track to â€˜play' with in addition to cinemas, pool tables and a huge library. There are massage therapists with whom you can book an in-seat massage too - but order this early as waiting times can be long. The thing is, the lounge is so big you tend to sit in one spot where you find a seat (there are no â€˜quiet areas', just lots of seats and tables dotted around). It's big and brash (like the network and advertising for it), and I will go back â€“ but it's not â€˜special'. The staff were also not especially welcoming. Questions about availability of yoghurt for example was met with a disinterested, â€œI don't know â€“ look over thereâ€. There was no feeling of being a special guest. It felt more like we were being done a favour by being allowed into the lounge â€“ now we must fend for ourselves. Even if you are not travelling in business class, IST is a fab transit point. Excellent shops, restaurants and bars. Both my wife and I said it will be our preferred transit stop, whichever class we travel in future. Signage could be improved and the information points were staffed were not interested in offering any form of â€˜customer service'. The one time we asked for directions we were answered with grunts and a tired â€˜nod' in the direction we should go. I would hesitate letting anyone transit alone who was unsure about how to get around an airport (elderly parent etc.), simply because of the lack of genuine help available by the staff on duty. The service of the flight to Kenya was equally good with nice choices from the menu. The presentation could do with some work â€“ meals brought out from the galley wrapped in foil (from an airline boasting top cuisine and a chef?) which is unceremoniously unwrapped in front of you. Turkish coffee was made from instant powder in full view of the cabin before being served (nicely) with Turkish delight. This was a little disappointing. Overall, a good product at an excellent price. The food service is good and transit process reasonably easy for frequent travellers. We will definitely book this airline again on this route.",Promoter

"  Antalya to Frankfurt via Istanbul. Out of 4 airplanes flown, 3 were rather dirty and had limited or no entertainment systems. No WiFi was available onboard. After arrival in Istanbul, it took 10 minutes for the stairs to arrive and another 10 minutes for the shuttle buses to come. Istanbul domestic is similar to La Guardia. Miles&Smiles I contacted TK more than 10 times and spend USD 60 on phone costs without getting any professional reply - at both Istanbul Miles&Smiles desks the staff was busy doing their personal things and any customer was an unwelcomed intrusion. The girl at the outside Miles&Smiles desk made it clear that she will not answer any questions and is only hired to print cards. The guy at the int'l inside Miles&Smiles desk refused to answer my question and I had to pay USD 30 entry fee to a nearby lounge to get my answer. Don't call them. Just write a message and maybe you will receive a reply within 2-8 biz days. If you have anything urgent, too bad. If you have a question at check-in, go directly to the supervisor. There, you might have a chance to get an answer - I asked the supervisor at the Istanbul lounge about the lousy Miles&Smiles service. She refused to answer, refused to investigate, and refused to forward anything. She told me to write an email to customer care - Turkish Airlines staff guided me to the wrong security check-in, because of that, I was stuck with customs / police for over an hour. There is no Turkish Airlines customer care service at Istanbul domestic airport or outside of security at the international terminal. I contacted customer care and didn't receive any answer to any of above raised points. Turkish Airlines have a few points that they advertise and that are great (like the Istanbul lounge), with most other things, I felt like Turkish Airlines is only a large cheap budget airline. I am still waiting for a reply from Turkish Airlines.",Detractor

"  I booked my Turkish Airlines flight from San Francisco to Vienna via Istanbul, and was nervous by the mixed feedback. But after 4 different flights (4 different planes, 4 different crews, all international) I can say I was fairly pleased with Turkish Airlines. Seats were more or less ok, each head rest had it's own USB so that's a plus - food was average, and I thought the staff was fairly friendly. Their English was ""eh"" but if you're leaving the states anyway it's really a moot point by then. I believe most of their flights are routed through IST, which I found an easy airport to navigate. I'd feel comfortable with a short layover here (like an hour) if that's a concern for anyone.",Promoter

This stop was too long. A319 good leg room, good food. Snow weather delayed 2 hours from Istanbul on old A330-300, less leg room than the A319 for ultra-long flight.

"San Francisco to Istanbul and return in the past 3 weeks with Turkish Airlines. These were the two single best flights in my many years of long distance travel. The newest business class seats (the plane was 3 weeks old) now have plenty of storage space under the foot rest. The service was friendly and very helpful (repeatedly checking in on our needs, smiling, energetic). The food was top quality (as good as a decent restaurant). Lie flat seats that are quite comfortable. This product far exceeds what you get on United, Lufthansa, and Air France to Europe out of SFO and tends to sell at about 40% less money than these other carriers. My only complaints is that drink service tends to be a bit neglected (e.g., if you want a second glass of wine you are going to have to ask for it, no one will offer). That's not much of a problem.",Promoter
"  Yesterday I returned to London Heathrow from Istanbul on flight TK1971, I have flown Turkish Airlines before and found them to be very good, however yesterday cabin service was poor. It was almost 2 hours into the flight before we were served a drink and the meal choice was just one pasta option, we were told that the meat options had gone. My wife cannot eat pasta so was given a vegetarian dish which looked very unappetising and my pasta was lukewarm and dry. The attitude of the cabin crew was that it was our fault as we should have pre-ordered a special meal.",Detractor

Again excellent service and landed early on both flights. I will choose Turkish again.",Promoter
"  Flew Turkish Airlines from Istanbul Ataturk to Cairo on a midnight flight. Check in was easy and quick, departure lounge was chaotic. A member of Turkish Airlines ground staff was very rude to passengers who had questions about their flight and shouted at one passenger who then refused to fly. Other passengers were telling the ground staff member to calm down and behave appropriately. Passengers were very uncomfortable about the situation. Although the ground staff work for TGS, this incident reflects part of the overall Turkish Airlines product unfortunately. Most passengers had up to three pieces of carry on baggage which delayed the departure of the flight as carry on luggage would not all fit in the over head bins on the aircraft. Turkish Airlines would become more efficient if it enforced a strict carry on baggage policy like other leading airlines do. Onboard experience was OK. Food on the flight was quickly served. It was a cardboard box containing a sandwich, salad and a mousse which was not as good as Egyptair hot food offering on the same route and not what one expects for the amount of money paid for the flight.",Passive

For a couple of years I have flown quite a lot with this airline and I have been very satisfied with the service and performance, however recently it seems like the previous high standard is declining. The flight from Copenhagen to Istanbul was okay, but the journey from Istanbul to Dar Es Salaam was nothing to write home about - not something good at least. Mediocre meal, uninterested crew, fixed seat without any possibility for adjustments etc. I hope that Turkish Airlines will show it previous strength and performance on the way back. I will still recommend THY on this background.",Detractor

"  I flew a total of 4 Turkish Airlines flights on my recent trip to Europe, from New York to Paris CDG via Istanbul, returning from Frankfurt to New York via Istanbul. The cabin crew were warm and friendly, food was quite good for aircraft food, especially if you are a fan of Turkish food. Expect a small salad, a yogurt/tsatziki sauce, choice between a chicken dish and a beef dish, with the lighter meal consisting of a pasta dish. There's warm bread and I've eaten more hummus on those four flights than I have in my life. The new A330s have a great entertainment system, with a nice multi-touch display, live TV, and wi-fi (purchase necessary). The slightly older A330 going from IST to CDG also had an older touchscreen display but was a bit unresponsive to input. The actual movies and TV shows were the same regardless of the hardware and so it was easy to overlook the hardware troubles. There is decent legroom although you start to feel a little claustrophobic once the person in front of you reclines back. For longer flights, they provide a little pouch of amenities like an eye mask, ear plugs, slippers, lip balm, and a toothbrush/toothpaste. For the price I've paid, I found the flights to be a genuinely pleasant experience and I would definitely fly with them again.",Promoter
"  Last September, I flew Istanbul to Vienna with Turkish Airlines. Seats were comfy for economy class standards, the food, a breakfast comprised of potatoes gratin and borek (Turkish pastry with cheese), was amazing.

"  Flew Turkish Airlines from Istanbul to London Heathrow. Fast and welcoming check-in experience at IST this time. Great lounge and direct fast track access as usual. On time departure and scheduled arrival to LHR. Both the ground and onboard experience are superior to anything on offer by other European carriers. Refined catering with several meal choices, even though the business cabin was nearly full, all meal choices were available. The ""Bat"" shaped menu, referencing their recent sponsorship was a nice touch. Both internet access (free of charge for J Pax) and live TV available throughout flight. Even managed to get a brief nap before our landing to Heathrow thanks to the comfort of the lie-flat seats. All in all a 5-Star experience considering this being a intra-Europe flight. Excellent value for money.",Promoter

Only positive was the food and small bag with slippers, sleep mask and ear plugs.",Detractor
"  Bangkok to New York via Istanbul. I have nostalgic affection for Turkish, and have flown them many times from Istanbul to New York - their Premium Economy on that route is one of the great bargains of air travel. Their Business product is another matter, though it has its good points. I flew it long haul from Bangkok to New York with mixed results. The A330 is small and cramped, especially if you are used to flying the A380 with Emirates, say. Cathay also fly this plane, however, and they herringbone the seats to give you privacy. No such luck with Turkish. The 2-2-2 configuration means you are either next to someone snoring with no divider - and no privacy whatsoever - or you are constantly leaping over someones legs to get to the bathroom. The cabin felt claustrophobic and hot for this reason. Food is superb and yes I love the little candles! Service is also professional and smiling and wines are high quality. Inflight entertainment is pretty mediocre : small screens, not much choice and low-brow movie selection. As is quite common with Turkish, my connection with New York was missed and when I arrived in Istanbul there was zero help from ground staff. I was just left to fend for myself. Appointments for the following day in NY duly cancelled, I struggled for four hours to get out of the airport with my (temporarily misplaced) bags and get a hotel voucher (vast line, an offer for a three star hotel). Not a Business class experience, to say the least. The limitations of Istanbul airport are not the fault of Turkish, of course, but the airline needs to seriously rethink its ground operations in the event of transit mishaps, especially as they are so common that I now hesitate about doing any connections in Istanbul. I arrived in NY the next day in a pretty bad mood. Coming back, boarding at JFK was like a rugby scrum, with no priority boarding and no organization. Stress all the way. All in all, Turkish Airlines try hard to make the on-bard experience friendly and gastronomically coddling which one has to appreciate, But for several thousands dollars I think I'll be flying a Far Eastern or Gulf airline next time - the product is just so much better and more logistically sophisticated. As many others have noted here, there is no customer service and so your little complaint will go entirely ignored, as mine was. In the future, I will use Turkish for short haul flights in Economy because they fly to alot of places and are good value for money. I'll leave Business trips to the big boys.",Detractor
"  Flew Turkish Airlines from Cape Town to Istanbul via Durban. Boarding: No boarding music, no pre-departure champagne offered (must be requested), no nuts/snacks offered with drinks (must be requested). Cabin/seat: dull grey cabin with no special lighting effects/mood lighting/flowers etc, rather dated business class seat in 2-2-2 layout, broken tray table storage mechanism meant my table protruded into seat area for 14 hours - especially uncomfortable when attempting to sleep. Technician attempted but failed to repair it during the stopover in Durban. Service: service from Cape Town was minimalist, but following a replacement crew in Durban things improved slightly. Nevertheless timing was too often off - starters and main courses were served but no accompanying wine offered (requested), it took over three hours to serve and clear a relatively small business cabin before lights were turned off, then switched on (not even gradually) 2.5 hours before landing for a quick breakfast service accomplished in an hour which left passengers bleary eyed and waiting for landing. A rather persistent cabin crew member insisted I and the passenger next to me raise our seat backs to almost 90 degrees forty minutes before landing (most decent airlines show some discretion is this regard until nearing final approach). Entertainment: limited selection of movies and TV shows, no WiFi/connectivity. Due to system issues it was reset at least twice en-route, unavailable for ten minutes each time, and meant having to fast-forward through films to the point at which it had been turned off. Arrival: parked at a remote stand and bussed to the terminal on arrival in Istanbul, found the spacious and well appointed Turkish Airlines lounge but waiting time for a shower was two hours. Opted to queue for a toilet. All-in all a rather disappointing and unrefined experience, relieved not to have paid for this trip myself, and wouldn't recommend Turkish Business Class when other (in particular Gulf) airlines offer a far better long-haul product.",Detractor
"Short legs from Rome to Istanbul and return were perfect, with real business class seats. Istanbul Ataturk Airport is presently a disaster, even for business class. It's overcrowded and business lounge difficult to find. The A340 to CPT obviously had been an ""outgoing model"". We boarded 2 hours late from the maintenance hangar - but arrived only one hour late in CPT. The worst were the seats. Although they nearly fully recline, the foot-rests do not hold up, which makes sleeping economy-class like. The fatigued upholstery was improved by sleeping-bag like covers provided by the crew. The worst had to come on the return leg from Cape-Town: the entertainment system on my seat had no sound and could not be fixed. Service and food had been good business class standard. With B/C-tickets about 700.- to 1000.- Euro cheaper than most competition, one probably has to tolerate imperfections.",Passive

Onboard was long haul Business Class Seats (A330) on the route GYD-IST, a friendly crew and a lot of meal options. Food had a good quality and was served very fast after takeoff.

"  I have taken Turkish Airlines flights from Mumbai to Dublin via Istanbul return flight multiple times - last one was March 2016. Boarding in Mumbai was fine on time. Food (Indian vegeterian) was good, cabin crew were helpful and asked us if we need baby food. Transit in Istanbul is the only worst part (so far) of this airline. Plane doesn't park at aerobridge and you need to take shuttle bus from plane to airport. Walk from airport entry gate to lounge is long. No pram for family travelers. You need to go through a security check before reaching transit area or lounge. Walk from airport gate to lounge is long without enough travelevators and you need to cut across crowd in congested area. Turkish Airlines Lounge in Istanbul is excellent - plenty of variety of foods and drink. A nice children play area and changing room. Flight from Istanbul to Dublin was almost empty. Cabin crew suggested us to leave bassinet seat and go to back of the plane and occupy a 3 seater. It was good suggestion, our baby slept peacefully there. Return from Dublin was an issue, at airport all display boards showed flight will depart from gate 307 (?), when we reached there 10 min before gate closure, we didn't see a single staff or notice there. We thought gate closed and everyone left, but wondering how come they closed and left 10 min before schedule closing time. Got panicked. display boards still showing gate #307. In this situation I thought to check with nearby gate staff but it was unmanned - the other adjacent gate was behind a wall. Went there, and boarding was happening at gate 308. But wondered why display boards are showing wrong gate and if it is wrong gate, then airline's responsibility to put some note, notice at gate #307, so that people don't panic.",Promoter
"  Oslo to Dhaka via Istanbul return. I have travelled with Turkish Airlines some times the past year, and it seems there is always is some sort of mishap - delays, technical problems with the entertainment system, booking of seats that doesn't exist etc. However, my past trip with made me wonder if they have heard of the term ""customer service"". I had booked their website. The trip passed through Istanbul with one hour waiting time. At 2am the day before my trip (ie. 34 hours before departure) I received an email (and email only) that my flight to Istanbul was 5 hours delayed, but there were no information about my flight from Istanbul, so I called customer service. It turned out that my flight had been cancelled, and that I had been shifted on a later flight, but Turkish hadn't thought about what effects that had on my flight from Istanbul. The initial thought of the customer service was that I had to stay overnight at Istanbul, and then take the flight the next day. There is only 1 flight from Istanbul to my destination every day, so that meant that I were facing a 24 hours delay and that I would have to wait until 6pm before my flight departed. When I told the customer service that this was not doable, he said that there were seats available on the flight to Istanbul on an earlier flight ( departure 7.30a, instead of noon), but that there were only business class seats left and that I had to upgrade my ticket. That is of course not acceptable. After 32 minutes on the phone with customer service, I got booked on to that earlier flight (giving me an 5 hours additional wait in Istanbul, but at least not a 24 hour delay to my arrival time). When I boarded that flight, I was seated in one of the economy seats that were supposed to be unavailable, and it also turned out that there were plenty of free seats on economy class. What kind of customer service is this? Unfortunately I had another horrible experience with Turkish on my flight back, where I were denied to check-in because I met up at the airport 52 minutes before departure instead of the required 60 minutes. There were no problems in assisting the business class passenger who arrived at the same time as me, but I was rejected because of these 8 minutes. I have never been late on check-in before, but I have seen many exemples of airline companies bending over backwards to help their passengers (especially if it was the last flight for the day, or in this case the only). Turkish would rather exploit it's customers. The irony is that this very trip was the one that earned me the last points for a membership upgrade. I will go to great lengths to avoid this airline in the future.",Detractor
"  I currently work in Adjara, Georgia and the nearest airport is at Batumi. As I am a UK citizen, I frequently fly between Manchester, UK and Batumi, Georgia via Istanbul Ataturk. I have made bookings for three trips between Batumi and Istanbul over the last three months and I have to say the performance of the airline on this route is shockingly poor. On 29 December 2015, my flight from Istanbul to Batumi was cancelled. Weather conditions at Batumi were blamed. I was offered an alternative flight to Trabzon, Turkey instead being told there would be a bus transfer to Batumi. On arrival at Trabzon, there was no information about a bus transfer and no-one seemed to have clue about what to do. Eventually, I managed to find someone who put me on a bus (it was obvious this had not been arranged to cater for the disruption) which then left meet at the Georgian border at Sarpi. I was then forced to make my own travel arrangements from there. On 24 February 2016 my flight from Batumi to Istanbul was cancelled. Once again weather conditions were blamed. Today (24 March) my flight from Batumi to Istanbul has again been cancelled with weather conditions at Istanbul Ataturk airport being blamed. However, on checking the Turkish Airlines website, it was noted that other international flights are recorded as having landed at this airport at around the same time my own was due to land. My work colleagues have also experienced similar disruptions and cancellations to their flights over the last three months (some of their experiences were even worse!). The flight between Istanbul and Batumi is supposed to be a scheduled daily flight. However, the level of disruption leads many of us working here in Georgia to believe the airline does not value its customers and can just cancel flights when it wishes if it believes it does not have enough passengers - with weather conditions being blamed as a way to avoid having to pay compensation. As far as I am concerned, this airline does not deserve the award of best airline in Europe.",Detractor
  Malta to Kilimanjaro via Dar es Salaam. We are frequent flyers with Turkish Airlines and our experience in this case was bad enough that we will probably never fly with them again. 7 hour flights at 2am and 4am in aircraft so small and old that the seat inclined (when it worked) just 30 degrees. Crew mostly indifferent. Food also indifferent - normally the food and service plus sky chefs on Turkish warrant a 5 star review on their own. We asked at Istanbul lounge if we could speak to a member of customer service about our experience and they said 'No. Post via the website'. So we did. Nobody even acknowledged. We love the Istanbul lounge and the food there and (normally) the food on board. But in general indifferent has got into the habit of seeing customers as pesky unwanted extras that get in the way of their job. So maybe they're just telling us to go to another airline.

"Flight from Dubai was delayed by an hour. Reached Istanbul expecting to have missed my flight as I arrived 30 mins before the flight. As soon as I arrived and finished Transfer Security Check, on checking the screen for the flights, Catania was missing from the Screen. Customer care they told me I have to change the Ticket at the transfer desk. On reaching the Transfer Desk I found there were quite a few travellers to Catania facing this issue. After the long queue, the guy at the counter had no idea what was going on and did not even care when I asked him what happened. One person at the counter said the flight had been cancelled so they are making a new flight early morning next day. Another Staff said the flight took off. Staff treated us as if we were cattle and without any hesitation decided which flight we ought to take. Finally after deciding I would go at the 6:45 am flight the next day, they arranged for the hotel stay and ask me to contact the hotel desk outside passport control. On asking about Visa, they say that I need to pay an extra 43USD. I found it pathetic that inspite of robbing us the time and our money for a service we paid to reach a destination at a certain time, they had the audacity to ask the passengers to pay extra. The Staff was actually like ""We are giving Hotel and Free Shuttle so you can at least pay this"". Really disappointed with the attitude of the Staff.",Detractor
"Our family of 4, flew with Turkish airlines from London to Kuala Lumpur via Istanbul return. London to Istanbul the aircraft was excellent, equipped with the latest entertainment - essential for keeping the kids occupied! The staff on board were so friendly and welcoming. From Istanbul to Kuala Lumpur, I couldn't help feeling as if we had been 'downgraded' as the front row in which we were sitting, only 1 out of 4 screens worked! One was stuck and 3 didn't work, so as there was ample space behind, my husband and son moved backwards, which was ok but meant we were sitting separately for most of the flight. The staff were less friendly than the first. These two factors made me feel a little disheartened. On our return journey, from Kuala Lumpur to London via Istanbul, we had an excellent journey. The entertainment was excellent, food was delicious, toilets were maintained and kept clean to a high standard and the staff were superb. However on the last leg of the journey, from Istanbul to London, we were very disappointed with the aircraft itself. It felt as if we were on a low cost carrier, as there was literally no entertainment onboard as there seemed to be a technical glitch on all the screens. That was a huge disappointment, as we expected to have a good quality plane, having paid a premium price for the journey. But the staff were exceptional and did their best to cater for us, ensuring the children were comfortable. Overall, we enjoyed flying on Turkish Airlines. They seem to take pride in the cleanliness of their aircraft, which says a lot about an airline. The food was to a high standard and the kids were gifted various toys as souvenirs of their journey. I would definitely consider flying with Turkish airlines in the future.",Passive

Inflight entertainment was fine. Cabin service OK - crew seemed to disappear after serving meal. Had free seats next to me so was perfect to spread out.",Promoter
"Edinburgh to Dalaman via Istanbul Business Class - a paid upgrade to Business Class. Nice lounge Edinburgh Airport. Proper Business Class seats on a 737-800, very comfortable. Handed a menu which they swiftly took away, they didn't have enough Business Class meals loaded so I got an Economy meal. One bathroom at front of Business but occupied so I used the rear one in Economy, only noticed there was no toilet roll. 4 Crew sat in rear talking. An 8 Hour layover in Istanbul, no lounge or accommodation provided. Dalaman to Edinburgh via Istanbul in Economy. Do not sit in Row 10 of Airbus they use A320? Elderly gentleman could not get his legs in, sat sideways, rude crew when he asked for help. Boeing 737-800 to Edinburgh comfortable in row 11. Handed a menu. At meal time no choice, they ran out from row 5 to 11. Meal, tea and coffee.. service over. Great seat back tvs. Case at Airport had been damaged and torn. Still better than BA for short haul seat back TV and music, crew indifferent.",Passive
"Turkish Airlines had the most competitive rate for the route I traveled. I travel to play golf and they will carry your clubs at no extra fee, unlike other airlines which will charge hundreds of dollars/euros more. Advance registration was simple and effective. Flight attendants are friendly and helpful. They do not speak a whole lot of english but enough to get you to and from your travel points. The food was very good. Alcohol is included but they do not give it out very generously. The entertainment system is first rate and includes more than enough variety to satisfy any traveler. I travel to Europe a couple times each year and they have the cheapest rate from my departure city into any city in Europe. I am very satisfied with this airline.",Promoter
"Turkish Airlines prices are competitive and seats are good. Arriving on Zurich airport I went to pick up my boarding passes, since a digital version appears not to be one of the options. They could only hand over the first leg to Istanbul as they had computer problems. ""Doesn't matter, you are flying Business"" was their response. Arriving in Istanbul I visited the transfer desk. Rarely does one see people who put so little effort into their job, truly amazing. On other business class flights I made had staff try make you feel comfortable and welcome but not on Turkish. The worst thing is that chances are you'll pass through Istanbul airport. Absence of priority boarding, many busses and an airport probably the perfect size for 25% of the travellers it actually welcomes on a daily basis.",Detractor
"Non-stop flight from San Francisco to Istanbul, return. We flew their Business class and the cabin was very spacious and well laid out. The service was respectful yet also friendly. (Our steward on the flight from SFO to Istanbul remembered us on the return and brought us exactly the cocktails we ordered on the first flight, after asking us if we wanted our preferred cocktail again). Seat very comfortable, lay flat a bit narrow but a great sleep. Food on board was also of great variety and quality. The business class lounge in Istanbul is without equal. Electric candles on the table at dinner used to great effect.",Promoter
"Bangkok to Gatwick via Istanbul with Turkish Airlines. Used the EVA Air lounge in Bangkok which is of a very high standard, good choice of food and drinks. The flight was good, full flat bed, plenty of room, good food and chef on board, staff a bit slow bringing bread and drinks. Used the very busy lounge at Istanbul, poor selection of food at breakfast, quite good at other times when I have used it. I was angry that customer relations are so bad with Turkish Airlines - I had a 16hour layover and should have been put up in a hotel. They could not get me on earlier flights as they were full, but they would not get hotel for me so I booked my own at my own expense and had to purchase electronic visas for my son and myself. The flight from Istanbul to London was okay, just daytime seats and mine did not recline. Overall for the price paid, the flights were good value. I would travel with them again in spite of the hotel problem.",Promoter
"Flying out of Tel Aviv we had a new A320 with personal tv in each seat. Same on the longer Turkish Airlines flight from Istanbul to Dusseldorf. Return flight from Dusseldorf same style of airplane looked a little older flight, from Istanbul to Tel Aviv a very old airplane. No more or less comfortable then any other short flight I have experienced. Food was good I will give them that. Boarding procedure could be better, and if as myself you have a gold card from Star Alliance, you would expect a preferential service even if my gold status was not issued to me by Turkish. Boarding priority was totaly not the case. The Turkish Airlines lounge in Istanbul airport is the best I have ever used, but lounge in Tel Aviv and Dusseldorf airport were bad. Istanbul airport is poorly organised.",Passive
"We flew Turkish Airlines from Manchester to Istanbul then onto Bangkok (return). All flights on time and check-in procedures quick and efficient. Onboard the service was very good and seats comfortable. IFE was a bit limited, but enough to keep us amused. Staff were very pleasant, smiling, courteous and polite. Beds made up by the crew on request. Drinks service was good, and food, though not 'on-demand', was absolutely delicious. A good choice of wines to accompany the courses. I enjoyed the meals I chose and had no problem obtaining my first choices on any of the flights. Lounge at Manchester was pretty poor, but IST was excellent and BKK was very good.",Promoter
"Check in at Gatwick was quick and was advised that flight to Istanbul was on time. By the time I had got through security,the departure board was showing a 35 minute delay. Was able to use the Clubroom Business Lounge in South Terminal and it was fine though very crowded. It did however provide a fine ,clear view of the single runway at Gatwick so after about 30 minutes there, was able to see the aircraft queuing for take off turn around and make their way back to the departure gates. This was followed by a display of a wide variety of emergency vehicles who proceeded to spray the runway in an attempt to clean up a fuel or oil spill. For about an hour nothing moved though no announcements were made in the lounge. Eventually, we boarded the flight and just sat there for about 45 minutes. The Captain kept us advised as take off was put back yet another 10 minutes though there was at no time any apology for the delay. Eventually took off well over two hours late and as I had 80 minutes to make my onward connection in Istanbul had the flight been on time, I realised I might have problems. Spoke to the purser during the flight who explained that Istanbul had experienced fog that morning. She added that as so many passengers on board were connecting to Bangkok, the onward flight would be held for us. Rather stupidly, I believed her. Flight was uneventful and service, seat comfort fine but after we landed at Istanbul, we taxied for about 20 minutes and were then bussed into the terminal. Despite the delay, no Turkish Airlines staff met the arriving passengers and the airport was chaotic. Eventually, I found an airline staff member who said my connnection was missed and telling me to go to the transfer desk. I found this and was concerned to see long queues. After about an hour I manged to attract the attention of a Turkish Airlines official and asked whether premium class passengers were expected to be treated like this whereupon he told me I had been directed to the wrong transfer desk. I found the business class transfer area and after a short wait was told I had been transferred onto a flight leaving at 0045, 6 hours after my planned departure time. By the time I got to the Turkish Airlines lounge my new flight was also showing a delay of an hour though the staff at the desk warned me it could be longer. The Lounge was so crowded. My onward flight to Bangkok was delayed by just an hour and again there was no apology or explanation. The flight was fine with a standard business lie flat seat. What was especially good was the standard of catering and the fact the the meal was served so quickly. It is a pity that what is essentially a good product at a very attractive price is so let down by such chaos when things start to go wrong.",Detractor
"Excellent experience on our flights from London Gatwick to Johannesburg via Istanbul return. Turkish Airlines staff were friendly from check in through to the gate and on board, we could not fault. The service on board with complementary Turkish Delight, hot towels, menus and well stocked amenity kits was excellent, as was the quality of food - which really was high for an airline. The IFE was very good with plenty of choice, whilst the leg room was certainly not an issue despite me being 6ft 4. Would certainly fly with them again.",Promoter
"Flew Turkish Airlines for the first time, from Mumbai to Barcelona via Istanbul. Check-in experience was fairly good. Had already checked-in online so directly went to baggage drop which was pretty quick.

"I flew Turkish Airlines from Kuwait to Istanbul Ataturk in economy class. The airplane which was an Airbus A330 was ok but the seats were old and not very comfortable, however the space is really good. The inflight entertainment system had a lot of things to watch and to do, but the screen was very hard to use. I had to press really hard on the screen for it to work. The food onboard was great and it was actually hot and the cabin crew were good. I should say that for the price I paid it should be a little cheaper. I think Turkish Airlines is a good airline and worth what you pay, but I think they can improve.",Promoter

Seat reclining system broken down. Transfer in IST with no security control, just walk to the new gate. Second leg (IST-KUL) with nice large screen, food quality good but not extraordinary. Cabin crew polite but not friendly. Arrival in Kuala Lumpur earlier than expected, airport clearance took more than one hour. Way back the same experience, earlier arrival times than expected. WI-fi not working on board, although advertised. This time with security control in IST airport. Good value for money, 400 Euro for the entire return flight.",Promoter

In the middle of the day we were asked to pull down the window blinds so that people could sleep.

When I arrive, I told them that I must give up and cancelled the ticket and instead of waiting for the next 24 hours, I better book Lufthansa instead which depart from Haneda at afternoon. I will avoid this airline after this. I even cannot give zero for the seat comfort and ground service.",Detractor

Tip for anyone thinking of TK, if flying the 77W in eco, choose a seat in the forward section of economy, it's much quieter. Overall it was a nice flight. The only downsides were IST airport which is absolutely horrible but that isn't TK's fault.",Promoter

"Istanbul to Sao Paulo with Turkish Airlines. I arrived at AtatÃ¼rk Airport at 6:00am of Feb. 4th. (so more than 3 hours before the departure time). The lady who attended me at the check-in counter first gave me the boarding tickets putting me and my family in sequential seats in the same row (51). But before she gave me the boarding tickets, she decided to talk to another attendant and after that she decided to reprint the tickets putting us in totally different seats. Note: one of the passengers was my daughter and she is just 1.5 years old! I tried several times to explain to the check-in lady that I was flying with my daughter and at least the father or the mother must travel together with her â€“ I bought a seat for her just to provide better accommodation and to not bother the other passengers. But she became angry and arrogant, just told me that I would have to solve this â€œproblemâ€ by myself with the gate staff or even with the flight attendants, or even ask people in the airplane to change the seats with me. So in summary the problem was created by Turkish Airlines and I would have to solve it by myself. At that time, I started to be angry with the arrogance and incompetence of the check-in staff, starting with the point that is simply unacceptable to have people working for Turkish Airlines in the International check-in desk who are not fluent in English â€“ without mentioning that they simply ignored the fact that a 1.5 years-old baby would fly alone with the insane arrangement this lady provided me at the check-in desk. Well, still following the instructions gave to me by the check-in lady, two other ladies who were working at the gate simply ignored my requirements. Only after I had to yell to one of that women, she told me (with a very angry face that she could not help me and I would have to solve this problem by myself inside the plane. When the gate was released for embarking, another employee required and took over my tickets and asked me and my family to wait outside the finger. We waited about 20 minutes and when almost all passengers entered into the plane, another employee gave me the tickets back and said that I would have to solve the problem by myself. At that time, I was fed up with the arrogance of employees who forced me to wait 20 minutes for nothing, and once I entered into the plane I had to start to yell in order to be attended by the chief of flight attendants, who had the courage to propose my wife to hold my daughter in the same seat, giving away to another passenger the extra seat that we bought. Only after I suggested to call the airport Police and required the presence of the airplane captain (and at that time my wife and my daughter were already crying) the crew moved and miraculously three seats appears at row 47!",Detractor

"Do not fly from Cape Town with Turkish Airlines. Business class did not have flat beds as they admit that the oldest A340-300 planes are used on this route. This resulted in the most uncomfortable night. The exclusive to business class toilet was out of order and the other toilets are very small. The entertainment is pathetic. There is no book containing the entertainment options available. The movies are extremely limited compared to other airlines and the main blockbuster has long ago left even the south African circuit. When I wanted to change my flight to the Cape Town - Johannesburg route so as not to be subjected to this plane again it cost me more than 6 thousand rands and I still have to pay for the trip from Johannesburg to Cape Town.

I arrived at the Turkish Airlines check in counter in Istanbul 2.5 hours prior to my scheduled departure and was told the flight was overbooked so I would be placed on standby, but should get on the flight. I didn't and from there the nightmare began. I was sent to 4-5 different counters and told different instructions at each one. No one at Turkish Airlines seemed interested in getting me on another flight. I understand overbooking flights is a common practice by most airlines, but there appeared to be no standard process in place to deal with passengers who have been bumped. The staff were extremely rude, unhelpful and offered no apology for my 7 hour delay. There was promise of compensation, but I haven't seen any compensation yet. Turkish Airlines customer service out of the airport seems just confused and unhelpful as in the airport. Terrible experience.",Detractor
"While in Nepal we were informed of a 2 hr delay of our Turkish Airlines return flight upon arrival in IST. There was no info about the connecting flight to Stuttgart for which there would be only 1/2 h to get it. Back in KTM we learned that we'd have to stay the night in IST. We managed to get a flight a day earlier, thus at least making up for the time loss. The flight was very pleasant. But info and service on arrival that evening in IST was appalling. We had to find our own way through the airport, no signs and not knowing where to report for the hotel supplied by the airline. After standing in line for the passport controll we were told we need a visa, so we had to go back to another counter and pay 50 USD for a visa. When, finally finding the counter for the hotel, there was another long lineup and and afterwards we sat waiting for a shuttle. The hotel was 10 min away, very nice and we got a late supper around 22:30. The food was disappointing. Next morning, without breakfast, we had to shuttle back to the airport at 5 in the morning for a 9:30 flight. We were through security and passport controlls by 5:30, the gate wasn't announced until 8:20 and only then we were able to go and sit. All these are things that happen when travelling. But what annoys me to no end is that the airline refuses to refund our visa fee. What makes it worse is the reason given: we supposedly acknowledged the delay when we altered out flight, flying a day earlier. I suppose we did acknowledge the delay -2 hrs is nothing - but we certainly did not acknowledge additional expenses. The downtown airline office in STG does not deal with customer complaints and is not helpful in any way. The same applies to the airport office. My request then forwarded to IST was first returned because it was in German. For every message to IST one has to jump all the hoops on their website and over and over again fill out the forms. The very poor info-policy and service of Turkish Airlines, the only way to deal with the airline through IST and not in one's own country and the refusal to refund our visa fee totally spoils an otherwise pleasant experience with the airline.",Detractor

"Turkish Airlines flight from Ankara to Istanbul with 6 hours delay on 21 January 2016. Boarding time was 10.25 and departure (scheduled) 10.55. Boarding completed and the gate was closed around 10.45. Normally this route is only 50 minutes. There was severe snow in Ankara. The aircraft has waited nearly two hours before take-off. Two hours later gave the news the flight had been cancelled. The passengers were requested to wait in the aircraft till it boards the gate. However 40 minutes after the announcement of cancellation, we heard another announcement that the aircraft perform its flight, however certain passengers declared that they do not want to fly, so the aircraft will wait till they leave and then perform the flight - the cancellation decision has been cancelled. Certain passengers left the aircraft voluntarily. Those who opted to fly waited till their luggage be removed. The following surprise was, the aircraft accepted new passengers once certain passengers left and their luggages removed. The newcomers luggage loaded in Cargo. Then another announcement ""Those passengers Who do not want to fly may get off"". A second wave of passengers left the aircraft and their luggages removed. The total delay has been 6 hours. Two consecutive flights on the same ESB-IST route after our TK2127 have been performed with 60-90 minutes delay. Snow is not sufficient to explain the reason of such delay. The cabin crew was really helpful and they served water, food, beverages with a pleasure. However Turkish Airlines failed the crisis management. The cabin crew performed the security demonstration three times because the aircraft was incoming new passengers as some other passengers preferred not to fly and leave. I had an intercontinental flight with KLM departing from Istanbul and I could tolerate 6 hours delay maximum, unfortunately I lost my intercontinental flight. A delay over 6 hours was out of my imagination. If the flight had been cancelled, I would not submit any complain and acccept the situation. I firmly believe that this extraordinary delay happened because the new passengers have been accepted to the aircraft, rather than the security concerns.",Detractor

"As a regular customer of Turkish Airlines I now have to write a review of the horrible experience we had flying back from Addis Abeba om Jan 2nd (plus the delay of our luggage on the way there on Dec 20th). It started on arrival in Addis on Dec 20th, none of our 5 bags had made it, it turned out that due to a change of plane there was not enough space in the hold and they had left most of them behind in Istanbul. Had to go back to the aiport the next day to get the bags, fortunately they were all there. Then on the way back our flight to Istanbul had a delay of more than 3 hours. We all boarded but then had to sit on the tarmac for 1.5 hours because they had to unload half of the luggage and told us it would arrive later. Of course we missed the connection in Istanbul and were greeted with total chaos due to the fact that extremely light snow had fallen. We had to queue for 4 hours together with hundreds of other people, no water, no food, many very angry people and no help whatsoever from any Turkish Airlines staff. To make a long story short: only because I insisted on getting on a flight that day were we lucky enough to be put on a flight to Amsterdam (not Brussels) which departed in total chaos as well. Many people were stranded for more than one night. We arrived in Amsterdam with 14 hours delay and no luggage. This was delivered to us after 5 days. Service on board this time was a lot less as well, IFE was not working or was not there at all, food was not as tasty and it was a very old plane on the leg to and from Addis.

First flight from Ankara to Istanbul was late which resulted in running to my international flight on the other side of Istanbul airport. That flight also took off late which put my arrival in Boston late. Once in Boston we sat on the runway for an hour waiting for a parking place. Completely unacceptable. You get what you pay for, so if you want a cheap flight that is not on time, this is the one to fly. Will not fly again.",Detractor
"Boarded my Turkish Airlines flight from Madrid to New Delhi via Istanbul on 21st January. My flight was late from Madrid so I caught my connecting flight runningly. When I landed in New Delhi I got to know that my baggage is stuck at Istanbul.They assured me that my baggage will be delivered to my doorstep within 24 hours. Today it's my third day of a week long trip only and they still hasn't delivered my luggage. The third vendor who they are using to deliver delayed baggages is rude and said that we will deliver it and we can't tell you when. No one is picking the phone and by chance if you are lucky and they pick up, they simply tell you ""we will update you"" which they never do.",Detractor
"Istanbul to Amsterdam with Turkish Airlines, and terrible service on the ground and in the air. Apparently the plane got changed, so people got assigned new seats by hand at the gate. My friend got reallocated from 5 to 27, last row in the plane, because a local guy didn't like sitting in the back. When he complained, he was talked to very rudely. The lady handling our queue all of a sudden decided to do something else, and leave us waiting. Boarding itself was according to row, but didn't get enforced, so when we entered, 90% of the plane was already full, including almost all overhead space. We had a huge delay, with close to zero explanation. When people asked about connections, they were told ""not my problem"", the temperature onboard was at 28 degrees, first we were told they can't change it, then later when half the plane complained, all of a sudden they could. I can accept delays, and even getting other seats. But the lack of courtesy, and plain rude behaviour of staff is not excusable. Last time I fly Turkish Airlines.",Detractor
"What a disappointment! We boarded the Turkish Airlines flight Kilimanjaro via Mombasa to Istanbul. This plane came from Istanbul - and was not cleaned during the stopover in Kilimanjaro. I found my seat dirty, used blankets and pillows - where I would be sitting for the next 9 hours during the night. Staff was tired and not friendly. The first stop would be Mombasa where the rest of the passengeres from Istanbul deboarded and others joined our flight back to Istanbul. On this 45 minute flights not even water was served and their were only 50 people on board. Take into account that at Kilimanjaro airport the shops where already closed during the night. At Mombasa the flight crew changed and cleaning staff came on board to ""clean"" the plane while we had to wait on board. They just folded away the used blankets - so the new passengers could use it. Everything on time, we departed from Mombasa at 3am. At 4am they turned on the light, served us a hot meal! Who wants to eat something at that time. Approx. 70% of people just wanted to sleep and did it. 5 hours later before landing at Istanbul, where most people woke up and were hungry, they just served a sandwich. Strange service concept. Istanbul AtatÃ¼rk airport is a mess to transfer. So crowded, bad announcements and dirty. I don't want to mentioned the toilets there. Flight to Hamburg was ok, staff was a little bit friendlier and meal good. Their English skills really basic. The A321-200 was in bad condition. Dirty, some bins taped to hold them closed, my IFE screen broken, sound not working. In all I'm disappointed by this service experience. Only positive: the flights were on time and we landed safely.",Detractor
"I haven't actually flown Turkish Airlines as I haven't been able to get so far as flying. I booked a flight via a travel web site to fly with Turkish Airlines in May 2016. Three days after receiving confirmation from the travel web site I checked the Turkish Airlines web site to see if I could choose my seats. The airline booking number given to me showed my reservations were cancelled. I checked my credit card and saw a charge of $824 for one ticket on my account and a pending charge of $3000 for the other 3 tickets purchased. I called the travel web site immediately since I know I am supposed to deal with them first. The rep for the travel web site contacted Turkish Airlines and kept me on hold for over an hour while he spoke with reservation agents and supervisors. Nobody could tell us exactly what happened or why. The agents simply stated the reservation was cancelled by the airline for some unknown reason. However, the reservation agents stated I would still be charged the full price for all four tickets as the tickets were non-refundable. Talk about unethical business practice. The airline screws up, cancels my booking without my consent or knowledge, and then charges me almost $4000. I understand charging the full price on a non-refundable ticket if the purchaser chooses to cancel, but how can the airline make that decision without any reason? The Turkish Airlines agent said nothing could be done on his end to rectify or correct the situation and that the travel web site agent would have to call a corporate sales office to work something out if it was possible. Mind you, nobody is saying I will get the situation taken care of. They are only saying I may be able to get the situation taken care of if I talk to the right people. I called Turkish Airlines myself the next day and was told the same thing: IF the situation can be fixed I would only be able to do so with the permission of the higher ups. When I asked for contact information for the corporate offices I was told to, ""look it up on the Internet and find it on my own."" Awesome customer service - just kidding. I did look up and call all of the corporate sales offices listed. None of them even put me through to a person. One had me on hold after the automated menu for 15 minutes and cut me off. Another simply had an auto message that stated, ""We cannot take your call. Goodbye."" And the others just rang. Realizing I may not resolve the issue before the pending charge of $3000 went through and a lot of time/red tape I promptly contacted my credit card company and explained the situation. The credit card company contacted Turkish Airlines and were given the same IFs and MAYs, so the credit card company went ahead and refunded me the $824 and promised to block the $3000 or refund it immediately if it went through before they could stop it. In other words book with caution as the customer service is awful and their practices can be very unethical.",Detractor
"Montreal to Ho Chi Minh City via Istanbul with Turkish Airlines. Value for your money, excellent quality of service. Flight attendants helpful, food was excellent, the seats were great and I did not experience a delay. No wifi on board. Inflight entertainment program is diverse. The only reason why I have stopped flying with Turkish airlines is because on the LH Miles&More program, to which they are affiliated, you only get 25 % of the miles you've actually flown, whatever your seating class is (I flew in business class and only got 2 % of the miles). The other setback is the fact that Istanbul Ataturk airport is one of their main hubs and this airport is just horrible - too small, totally unadapted to what ought to be a travelers experience today. So if you fly with Turkish Airlines, you're very likely to have to transit through this airport.",Promoter
Venice to Istanbul on a new A321 with the personal screens. Flight landed at Ataturk 15 minutes ahead of schedule. Cabin crew nice and efficient. Istanbul to Jakarta on an A330-200 with the old seats type which I personally do not like. Flight left 35 minutes late due to airport congestion but landed in Indonesia half an hour early. Both flights not full. I have noticed that food portions in Economy class have increased on long-haul flights. Food quality is top notch. I am an Elite Star Alliance Gold member and fly Turkish Airlines often and have never experienced any big delays or had luggage lost or damaged. The Business lounge at Ataturk airport is impressive.,Promoter
"Malaga to Istanbul on TK1306 on 22 January 2016. Having recently acquired Elite status on Turkish Airlines, I was well aware that they are great in the air but pretty ordinary on the ground. Based on this flight with my wife today, I am ready to change that opinion. TK has become pretty ordinary both in the air and on the ground. I was confident that we would get exit row seats at check in at Malaga but were told all seats were taken. Luckily, I prevailed on the agent to give us a window and aisle with the middle seat vacant, which she did. There is no in-flight recognition by Turkish Airlines of a person's Elite status. My wife's seat did not recline. The crew were downright poorly trained. They did not do a seat belt inspection before take off and landing, window blinds remained closed as well. Food service was surly. The rice was cold, got standard kebabs that were awful. When I asked for a second helping of water, I was met with a glare. The crew spoke very poor English - something very common with Turkish Airlines cabin crews. When we landed in Istanbul after being in a holding pattern for 45 minutes, we were at the far remote end of the airport. The first bus left and we were left standing in freezing weather waiting for the next bus. Then the chaos of IST airport. All in all, a pretty dismal experience.

"My flight Turkish Airlines from Tel Aviv to Munich via Istanbul was cancelled and I was not notified. I found out once I got to the airport. I went through a brief security before going to check my bag in. The women who checked my bag than got extremely upset, borderline yelling at me, saying that I didn't go through the security area. It got to the point where the man who put me through security had to come and calm her down. Incompetent in the fact that the new flight they put me on had a 7 hour layover in Istanbul. The check in person, promised my bag would go to Munich, which of course it didn't - when I finally arrived in Munich and talked to the representative about my missing baggage, she said that since I was flying back to Minneapolis the next day instead of sending my bag to Munich they would just send it to Minneapolis, than have it delivered to my house, which was a lie. When I tried to track my luggage once I was home it didn't work. I called their customer service, who to be extremely kind, are inadequate at all and any part of their job, to try to locate my bag. The gentleman stated my bag arrived in Minneapolis on Sunday, it was lost on a Friday, and that it should be shipped to my house tomorrow. The next day comes and still no bag so I call back. The man tells me that my bag just passed customs and they have 24 hours to deliver it to me. I wait two days before calling back, quite annoyed at this point. The man I talked to this time tells me my bag went to Munich and that's all he can see. So I let him know that other customer service staff I talked to were able to find out much more and he should get better at his job. He was than able to see my bag came to the US through Icelandair and is in MSP airport. I told him that everyone I've talked to has said it will be shipped to my house and when I would be able to expect it. He said they don't work with any delivery company in the US and that he isn't able to give me any more information. So when I asked him what I was supposed to do about getting my bag back and he responded with â€œI don't knowâ€, I don't think he was ready for the reaction he got. After showing him my frustration he was then able to locate the airline that my bag got to Minneapolis with and gave me their phone number. I called the airline and sure enough my bag had been sitting in their office all week. So after being lied to, by multiple people, that my bag would be shipped to my house, I had to make a 4 hour drive to the airport to pick it up over a week after it was lost. So don't fly this airline unless you want to be so upset that you write a short novel on how much you despise them.",Detractor
"Los Angeles to Tel Aviv via Istanbul and I've never flown Turkish Airlines, and after reading reviews I was nervous. At check in, I knew that one of my bags weighed more than the 50lb allowance, but the woman at the ticket counter was sweet enough to let it slide, and didn't charge me the extra fee. I flew with a friend who bought his ticket before mine, so we didn't have seats next to each other. The women at the gate were sweet enough to tell us there was a row in the back of the plane with nobody occupying it, so him and I were able to spread out amongst 3 seats and actually be comfortable. As soon as we took off they handed out coffee and drinks, little candies and a warm towel. My one issue is that by the time they got to our row, they had run out of the veggie option for dinner. I don't eat non-kosher meat so I ended up not eating, but that was my own fault for not requesting a special meal. The flight went by quickly, and the staff was very sweet and helpful. Even on the second flight, which was only an hour and a half long, we got served a dinner and drinks. The on-board chef even brought this little girl a cake out to the cabin because it was her birthday. I've never seen an airline do that, and it put a smile on my face seeing them go well out of their way to do something that sweet. Will absolutely fly them again!",Promoter
"We had four flights with Turkish Airlines in December 2015 and January 2016, and every one was a complete disaster. From the entertainment systems not working, rude and unhelpful staff to the delays and lost baggage. I have been trying to find where our bags are for three weeks and nobody can help. When we were delayed for over 8 hours they did not even provide water. Every queue we stood in the result was the same. Please go to counter 'XY' where they will help. It cost me an arm and a leg to get home and then they lost my luggage leaving my without clothes or toiletries. If you email them you will be met with a standard email template reply. To put the cherry on the top of our trip, when returning to Gatwick they left everyone's luggage in the carts and expected passengers to unload bags. Needless to say bags were being thrown around and dropped. See the picture.",Detractor
"I just returned from a trip where I used Turkish Airlines, flying from San Francisco to Rome via Istanbul. I left San Francisco on January 1st. Check in went fine. The flight was fine. I had a layover in Istanbul and then on to Rome. I got to Rome and had no luggage. I was told it was left in Istanbul. The form was filled out and I was told they would deliver it to me either the next day or the day after that. This made me nervous as we were leaving for a cruise 4 days after my arrival in Rome. I didn't hear anything the first day. I tried to call them all through the second day and it was constantly busy, so I emailed them. They responded and said they did not have my luggage. I emailed every day and got the same reply every day for four days until we left on the cruise. Everything I needed for that cruise was in that bag - all the formal gowns, shoes, purses, etc. Once onboard the ship, they also tried to contact Turkish Airlines, but were not given any type of response. I called the airline during the cruise. I was told my claim had been closed and that my luggage had been delivered. When I questioned them about this as I had not received my luggage, they stopped responding to me. I called again and they told me to call a different number which I did. In the end, I was told to call four different numbers before they told me to call back to the original number. Each time I was told they could not help me. When I returned to Rome 16 days later, I went to the airport to try and find my luggage. After a considerable amount of time, they found it. A bit too late, however. Not having my luggage meant my daughter and I could not attend the three formal gala nights on the ship - the thing we were most looking forward to. Although we tried not to let the situation ruin the cruise, it definitely was not the vacation we had hoped for. For my return flight, Turkish Airlines cancelled the first flight and rebooked me on a flight four hours later. They caused me to miss my connecting flight. They were not concerned about my second leg, although it was booked on their airline. When I pushed them to get me home, they ended up booking me on British Airways. When I asked about compensation for the 1500 euros I had to spend on clothes, toiletries, etc, I was told sorry, fill out a form and someone will probably get back to you. So, here I am, not getting compensation and no one will respond to my emails or talk to me in person. Save yourself a ton of heartache and use a different airline. If anyone from Turkish airlines is bothering to read this and actually wants to help, I would welcome an email from you.",Detractor
"Me and wife flew Turkish Airlines from Toronto to Lahore with a layover in Istanbul. The plane from Toronto to Istanbul was a little cramped for legroom, which was a 3x4x3 setting. I can't sit for very long and had to get up a few times and there was very little leg room to stretch my legs, my knees were almost touching the seat in front of me and I am not the tallest guy under 6'. Entertainment system was nice though, nice big screen with a lot of variety, the earbuds the airline provided are terrible for fitting, so just use yours with the adapter they provide. Touch screen is a little annoying as they don't have the best accuracy. One of the few airlines that provide care package that includes slippers, socks, ear plugs, toothbrush and paste, wich is really nice. If you have little kids they will come around prior to take off with little baggies for them. Plane was clean overall, and the crew were overall very nice although English is not the best, making it hard to understand at times. Food was hit and miss. The main meal was decent, the dessert was great. Our next flight after this was from Istanbul to Lahore and the seating was roomier thats for sure. I think I would have enjoyed the flight more if not for the 4 hour layover that was compounded with a 4 hour delay with another 2 hour delay on the tarmac. The plane was clean and the cabin crew were nice once again. The food was again hit and miss as this time the main meal was not so great, dessert was nice though. Also whats nice is that you can ask for a sandwhich or dessert anytime during the flight or get up and go the the kitchen area and they have water or juice ready for you. Coming back, again the planes were clean and cabin crew were nice. Entertainment system was working all the way through. No delays at the airport this time. Overall I would say this is a decent airline, not the best. They have one big flaw and that is they are known for delays. I was told even before I flew that be prepared for this, I took this remark with a grain of salt as I know that it happens with all airlines. When we got to Istanbul I have never seen so many delays and cancellation on the gate screen, so be prepared for that.",Passive

Wide selection of beverages. Main Course selections rather repetitive but of high quality. When everything goes according to plan Turkish Airlines, is really a great airline.

"Some snow in Istanbul the day before my flight completely overwhelmed Istanbul airport and Turkish Airlines. My flight was 4 hours late out of Berlin. The bus in IST took another 15 minutes to leave the plane and my connecting flight to Johannesburg was nowhere signposted, and no ground staff around that could be asked. Maybe that was just bad luck, but than the nightmare (3 am) began. There was a queue of hundreds of people in front of a transfer desk which did not move at all! There seemed to be quite some ground staff behind the counter, but it was not clear what they did except walking back and forth ignoring passengers' pleads. Children were sleeping on the floor next to the line. After three hours I left my travel companion in the line and walked the airport to find another less crowded travel desk. Here ground staff was also walking away from exhausted passengers and their questions. Ground staff sent passengers to the other transfer desk to get rid of them. I persisted and finally got a boarding pass for a day later. No offer of food, accommodation or anything (7 am). The flight the following day was again 3 hours late and did not make up for the disaster. Filthy seat, uninterested crew and poor food. I don't support reviewers opinion on food. The only smiles I got on the roundtrip was in TXL and JNB at check-in from non TK staff. Return trip was uneventful but I witnessed IST ground staff again walking away from customers who missed a connecting flight to Athens due to a late arrival.

"Vienna to New York JFK via Istanbul, and the flight from Vienna to Istanbul was pleasant and generally unremarkable until landing in Istanbul. It was pouring rain, the aircraft was parked and buses arrived to take us to the main airport. A bus for business class was provided, however when we tried to board, a ground person aggressive waved his arms and yelled, ""No more"". I said, ""we are business class,"" and tried to show my boarding pass only to have him become more aggressive, and shout, ""go"". There are no signs in the gate areas to direct traveler with connections to the the business class lounges. The flight from Istanbul to New York JFK was dismal. I will say the only saving grace is the food service is very good. The overhead bins are literally 1/3 filled with bedding and other equipment. The crew seemed trained to ignore service than provide service. Baggage service at JFK was very slow, and of course when our bags finally arrived, they were completely soaked, obviously having been left out uncovered in Istanbul!",Detractor

When we came to Iran the nightmare began. Our suitcases didn't arrive we had to go to the funeral the next day but we didn't have our stuff for three days.

Call center staff does not know the benefits each frequent flyer tier of their own program offers. Ground staff overall not helpful. However when it comes to the actual flight, things can change, their service up in the air is really good. Both my flights at this trip I received a real good service.

"I had more than 20 flights on Turkish in the last 15 months, both international (European) and domestic. Out of those flights, half of them were on time with the other half were delayed by about an hour - only one had a four hour delay because of weather. As long as everything goes right, TK is a pretty good airline, but as soon as something goes wrong, their disaster management is a disaster itself and as a passenger you're usually left with no information about what's going on. Besides that, ground services are pretty slow as well and sometimes you're waiting for more than half an hour at the luggage belt. Seats on the narrowbody fleet are mostly okay while those on the A330s are pretty uncomfortable (didn't try the B777 so far). Turkish Airlines inflight catering is excellent and oustanding compared to most other airlines. When changing planes either at AtatÃ¼rk or Sabiha GÃ¶kcen airport, allow yourself some extra connecting time as flights are often a bit delayed and baggage handling and immigration (for domestic connections) sometimes takes ages. That extra time also increases the chance your luggage will make it on the connecting flight too. To sum it up, I reccommend Turkish but you should also be aware of the possible drawbacks.",Passive

I was then directed outside of the airport by a police officer and had to go back through security to get back in. I joined the 6 hour queue at Turkish Airlines desk and managed to get another flight 2 days later. I then had to join the Supervisor queue then the hotel queue and finally put up at a hotel.

"Like others have said here, the service by Turkish Airlines over New Year 2016 was appalling. I was flying Baghdad to London via Istanbul, and eventually arrived in London 31 hours late. The delays are bad enough and are far worse than can be justified by the bad weather alone - don't they know it snows sometimes! But it was the service and couldn't be bothered that made it so much worse. The level of service at the transfer desk for people who had missed connecting flights was so bad I thought it must be a hidden camera TV show. There were about 500 people in the queue, but only 4 or 5 people working. There was no security and on several occasions fights nearly broke out. This is not surprising as it was the early hours of the morning and people were tired. Any decent airline would have put on extra staff and kept people updated. They would have identified elderly passengers and people with young children and provided them with special service. I was in neither of these categories but would have understood the need. What I would not have understood was why it seemed Turkish passengers able to speak the language were frequently being given special treatment and allowed to jump the line. I was stood in this queue for 4 hours and not once did I see anyone that vaguely looked in charge. It was atrocious. But no one from Turkish Airlines seemed very bothered. Whilst TK might be cheap, you clearly get what you pay for! A lesson learned for me. TK claims to be one of the best airlines in Europe. Under EU law I would be entitled to some compensation I'm sure (even the bad weather can't justify such a terrible delays) but I doubt Turkish Airlines will live up to those standards. Because they so unreliable I'm sure it suits them not to have to.",Detractor
"When things go wrong (which often they do when it comes to international air travel) Turkish Airlines simply are not equipped to handle it, nor do they have any interest. Their company is built with a front end, but no back end. Incompetent and rude staff hangs up and walks away in the face of concerned customers. Turkish Airlines uses confusion, bouncing their customers from call center to call center and desk to desk, playing them in circles until they tire and give up. Most of their flights connect through Istanbul airport and it is pure chaos. A shiny building and western style stores and restaurants do not make up for under experienced, under trained and the lack of an idea of what the concept of customer service is. This is something I experienced on a flight from Chicago to Istanbul 7 days ago. In the 7 day time span my bag has been ""found"" 3 times, even informing me of its location at the Sofia airport. I had confirmation from a Turkish Airlines desk, and their Call center. When I traveled there to gather it, I was told it was never there. The lost luggage airport staff in Sofia informed me this happened with 80% of the people coming to the airport to gather luggage sent by Turkish Airlines. I have never seen anything like this. Yes, the flights are cheap and they pamper you inflight, but be aware you are gambling.",Detractor

"The flight arrived late for my connecting flight in Istanbul to Aqaba, Jordan - the next available flight was in 3 days. They then told me to check google for other flights (yeah that's right, they told me to check Google). After four hours I managed to negotiate a flight the next day. They then told me my luggage was lost after 3 hours of waiting. They then took 4 hours to take me to a hotel, were late to pick me up the next morning to get on the next flight. And here the drama really started. Turkish Airlines booked me on a Royal Jordanian flight - but obviously hadn't told them. So I went to Royal Jordanian, they said I had no flight and that I should go to Turkish Airlines. TK told me to go back to RJ, and RJ told me to go back to TK. Eventually, TK did their job and spoke to RJ who put me on their flight. But, only as far as Amman. Which meant I would have to pay for a hotel and another flight to Aqaba - utterly ridiculous. And to make matters worse, they couldn't find my luggage. So to cut a long story short, I made my way from Amman to Aqaba, and three days later, I still have no luggage. Turkish Airlines are a joke. In short, they spend too much time tweeting how good they are, and paying for adverts to do their job.",Detractor
"London Heathrow to Tokyo Narita via Istanbul on Turkish Airlines. Firstly we were delayed for 1.5hrs, it happens sometimes, I get it. But when you have to transfer and the airline know they will not transfer your luggage but fail to mention is another story. They had 1 hr in transit to do this but instead made everyone who originated from London wait for an hour at the baggage belt before being instructed to fill a lost baggage form. I had only 2 nights in my destination and spent a lot of the time trying to speak to someone and when I finally got through I instructed the lady on the phone when the lost baggage comes in I will pick it up as I am coming back to the airport before I head to the mountain, she said this was fine and she made a note. On the day I arrived to the airport I got an email saying it will be sent to my hotel by the mountain and will arrive 2 days later. I then had to head to minus temperatures with no jacket and will have to buy / rent all my snow gear. Thanks Turkish airlines for making my trip stressful and needlessly more expensive. Apparently over 150 lost baggage came in that day so this seems to be a common occurrence. Avoid airline if you don't want to be wearing the same clothes for 3 days!",Detractor
"On January 1st, 2016, my flight from Tehran to Istanbul (TK875) was delayed for over 5 hours. The passengers, including myself did not receive any prior notification from the airline. Considering that many previous flights were cancelled due to weather conditions in Istanbul, the airline had surely predicted delay, but failed to inform the passengers, or make announcements in the airport. No information was provided from the Turkish Airline Staff, and finally when the plane took off and landed in Istanbul, we had to wait another 2 hours for the plane to be allowed to park. I had already missed my flight to New York (TK 003) which was scheduled for 7:25 on that morning. I understand that sometimes the weather conditions can cause delays and cancellations. What I am complaining about is the poor management, rude attitude of Turkish Airline Staff, and the very low-quality service provided by the staff in the airport. When I finally got out of the plane, we were confronted with a terminal full of stranded, confused, and unorganized passengers. There was no airport or Turkish Airlines Staff to guide us to the correct directions. Naturally we went to the Transfer Desk, to get information on how to get on the next available flight. More than 1500 passengers were jammed around the counter. There was not even one airport, security or airline staff to organize people and ask them to stand in line. Every one was just jammed in front of the counter. There was rarely enough space to breathe or move. The staff behind the transfer desk were clearly incapable of managing the situation. Instead of managing it, they also lost control and were shouting and banging their fists on the counter! After 2 hours of standing there, my passport was lost by one of the staff, and I had to wait for another hour for them to find it. Only to find out that all that trouble was for nothing, as I was told to go through passport control and then to the Check-in terminal, and go to Turkish Sales Office. This demonstrates the incapability and poor management of the airline and staff. They wanted to get rid of me by making me enter Turkey (through passport control) and go to check-in terminal, so that I am not their problem any more! I had no other choice, so I followed their advice. The Sales Office line was a nightmare. The line stretched all along the Ataturk Airport check-in Terminal. Turkish Airlines Staff couldn't care less. They acted indifferent and did not help in any way. I immediately begged one of the staff to help me get on the last flight of the day (TK11) at 5:30. A staff member helped me go through and I was told that I can sit on flight TK11 to New York, on business class, and they told me to go to Business Check-in Counter E.",Detractor
"I had traveled with Turkish Airline 3 times now. The last time from Dhaka to Toronto via Istanbul was the worst experience I have had. Their flight from Bangladesh was delayed which reduced the transit time in Istanbul considerably. The staff at Istanbul can barely communicate in English. I was helping a neighbor friend with two children as there were none to help them even with proper direction. And they closed the gate without us although we had our boarding pass. They didn't search for us or even care to find us. Afterwards they flew the family without any further charge but not me, I had to pay for a full ticket. I tried to reason with them but alas if only they could not communicate in English.",Detractor
"On my sisters return from Cape Town, the Istanbul to London leg was cancelled. Istanbul airport was a shambles. Few people could or cared to speak English and airline staff were rude, dismissive and aggressive. They were in a queue for 4 hours to be told they need to return the following day. My nephew had a broken foot and was in a cast. They were also told to sleep in the airport as there was no available accommodation. They arrived home 48 hours after leaving CT. Their 3 suitcases have subsequently been lost. After 10 days they've received no feedback, no returned calls and their calls ring unanswered. When my sister did get through she was told there was no update. We understand that life happens. Bad weather and many other factors mean flights are cancelled but the rudeness experienced as an English speaking woman with an injured son by this establishment is deplorable.",Detractor
"Appalling customer service! Due to snowfall in Istanbul, my flight from Taipei to Istanbul was delayed by 7 hours and I missed my connecting flight to London. The staff at Taipei had reissued my ticket for a later flight but this was cancelled at the last minute without any information. I was treated rudely by staff at the airport (both ground staff and Turkish Airlines reps) forced to queue up in 5 different queues for many hours and buy a Â£20 entry visa to Turkey to pass into a different section of the airport in order to get the airline to reissue my ticket. When they reissued it they told us that we had to rush as boarding time was in 30 minutes, so I prioritised getting to the gate over staying at the reissue desk to deal with the baggage information. We then discovered that the new flight was 10.5 hours late and they hadn't told us. Turkish Airlines caused more chaos at the boarding gate as they let people onto the plane who had only been issued with standby tickets and then had too many people trying to board the plane. After a 23 hour delay I reached London, only to be told by the Turkish Airlines lost baggage rep that despite being sure my baggage was not on the flight (given what happened in Istanbul and the fact that it was not found on the LHR system) I had to wait two hours by the belt while the staff shifted bags on and off it while everyone on my connecting flight stood around unable to see their bags. Finally I was allowed to fill out a lost baggage form. After three days I called to see if there was any progress and discovered they had mixed up the details of the bag's description. After 9 days by bag was finally returned to me.",Detractor

"London to Singapore via Istanbul with Turkish Airlines, and a 22 hour delay on the ground. Outbound to London, everything went excellent - service by attendants and minimal delays taking off and landing. When I fell asleep on the first leg from Singapore to Istanbul and couldn't find my glasses, the attendant was very helpful in searching for it, even ripping out the seat in case it was stuck there. Food was really good also, considering when I slept through meal service and by the time I woke up, the flight attendant told me that my meal wasn't fresh anymore so she gave me a business class vegetarian meal instead. However, on my inbound flight on New Year's Eve/day, everything was a mess! I showed up at Heathrow to hear of a flight delay. Supposedly 1 hour became four, then five hours due to snow. They could have updated the website or sent a courtesy email so I didn't have to spend 8 hours at the airport before take off. Landed in Istanbul after circling for 2 hours due to lack of landing spots and another 2 hours waiting on the runway. Missed my connecting flight of course, and had to queue for 2 hours to get rebooked and re-sorted out on my next flight back to Singapore. Total chaos there with 30 crying babies at any one time and very rude, sneaky men cutting in line and making offensive remarks when I didn't let them cut in behind/infront of me. Ground staff and customer service desperately need training on conflict resolution and soft skills. Finally got on my plane, yet after another 1:30 delay. In flight entertainment wasn't working and the attendant had to spend an hour trying to fix my console as the flight was completely full. At least the meal service was wonderfully tasty.",Passive
"Hoi Chi Minh City to Istanbul via Bangkok, and this was the first time i flown Turkish Airlines. I've heard a a lot about it, but it didn't meet my expectations. The legroom is smaller than some Asian airlines, and it's was hard to stay comfortable for a long-haul flight. Flight crew were not as friendly like I thought. They have a wide selection of movies and games to try, the food and beverages were outstanding, even though it was just economy class meal. So overall, I recommended this airline but they should improve their seat comfort for long-haul flight.",Passive

Ample amount of snacks at the galley for passengers to eat at anytime during the flight. Service was commendable.",Promoter
"Extremely unhappy and will never use Turkish Airlines again. An 8 hr delay in Cairo caused to miss our connecting flight, and we had to wait for 26 hrs in Istanbul Airport. For our return, a 2 hrs delay in Edinburgh caused us to miss again our connection and we had to wait for 7 hrs in Istanbul airport. Was forced to pay GBP 250 for 23 extra kilos and it was stated on the website 40kg allowance per person from Edinburgh - but they meant for outbound not inbound which wasn't clear.

"I am disappointed with Turkish Airlines transit related services specially after they are promoting so heavily as a leading transit destination. I was travelling from Stuttgart to Mumbai via Istanbul on 16th December 2015. I missed my connecting flight in Istanbul due to the delay of the flight coming from Germany. I was put on the next flight scheduled to depart 24 hours later. In order to avail the hotel accommodation provided by the airline, I had to pay the e-visa fees in Turkey. I was told that this fee shall be reimbursed by the airline, but no process for the same was mentioned. Now I am trying to get in touch with the Turkish Airlines and they are absolutely unresponsive.",Detractor
"Turkish Airlines from Cairo to Amsterdam via Istanbul, and the flight itself was fine once airborne, food and entertainment were standard. But the ground operation is shambolic. Our flight leaving Cairo was delayed for one hour. I understand that this happens and little can be done about it, but once we arrived in Istanbul there was zero assistance to help people make their onward transfers. There were no staff at the arrival gate to direct passengers or offer assistance to more elderly people who couldn't run (unlike ourselves- if we hadn't sprinted we wouldn't have made the next flight). We had to push to the front of the security line, whereas many other airlines escort you to the front if the connection time is tight. Our gate had just closed when we arrived, but still made the last bus to the plane. Although the plane then sat on the runway for another hour. In short, there may as well have been no ground staff in Istanbul they did so little. This would be semi-understandable in a small provincial airport, but this is their hub! To finish everything off, our bags were lost. They were eventually delivered to us 4 days later, soaking wet. Not damp - drenched. Every item in my bag was heavy with water, as if it had been left in a thunderstorm for hours. I will not be travelling with Turkish Airlines again.",Detractor
"I would like to show extreme dissatisfaction on the service I received during my recent experience with Turkish Airlines while coming back from Athens to Nairobi via Istanbul. We were to get a flight from Athens to Istanbul around 22:05 and then a connecting flight to Nairobi from Istanbul on 00:55. Much to our surprise when we reach at Athens airport at around 6:00om we came to know that the flight has been canceled. When I asked why we have not informed on the number we have mentioned on the ticket they declined to answer and asked us to get into a flight which was scheduled at 7pm. I was travelling with my wife and my 2.5 years daughter we actually had to run for check-in, security check, immigration etc as airline staff asked us to rush to get into the flight. Finally we reached to the gate but flight started after 8:30pm. We could not understand why we had been rushed for the formalities with a small baby. When we reached Istanbul, we have been informed that flight is late and eventually it was announced with the gate around 3:40am. We got into the bus and we had been taken to the aircraft but we had not been allowed to go out of the bus for almost 45 mins. Later on we had been taken back to the terminal and asked to wait. When we asked for the reason first they said that the Nairobi Airport is closed due to heavy snow fall which was an utter lie and later on the staff informed us that there is no Crew for the aircraft and it will take some time. We waited at the terminal without any assistance from anyone, sitting on the floor with the baby till 11am, and then they announced that flight has been cancelled and asked us to contact transfer desk. At transfer desk we had been given the new boarding passes and had been asked that next flight will be 0050 in the night which mean the whole day. I requested to give us some assistance as we have a baby and its very cold, but they refused to assist me in any way and later on just asked me to go away from the counter which was very rude. Later I took my own visa and booked the hotel by myself to go out so that we can have some rest. Later on next day when we landed at Nairobi all of our baggage were missing and there were no information. I had to follow-up with airport authorities and Turkish Airlines office daily to get my bags on the 6th after 4 days. The airport staff did not have normal empathy. I was at the airport for almost 12 hrs and did not even get an assistance of a blanket or a bottle of water.",Detractor
"We decided to go with Turkish Airlines this time from Boston to Karachi via Istanbul, over Emirates / Qatar Airways because of recent positive press. Never again. I don't understand how an airline can claim to be the new global hub airline, but then have absolutely no contingency plans in case of bad weather. As a result of snow in IST, hundreds of flights were cancelled, which is understandable. However, there were minimal ground crew available to assist, and frequent misdirection on the part of the crew who were present. Inflight, the crew on almost all four legs of our round-trip were surly and occasionally downright rude. The IFE was of pretty good technical quality, but quality of the programming was awful.",Passive

We stayed overnight at airport with 2 years old baby who was sick and my wife is expecting, but no hotel was offered.

"Birmingham to Johannesburg via Istanbul return. My wife and I fly from Birmingham to South Africa with our 3 year old daughter quite frequently using Swiss, Lufthansa, KLM, Air France and Emirates. On this occasion we decided to try Turkish Airlines and while the service was okay in flight, we were shocked and disappointed with the complete chaos and lack of organisation we experienced from Turkish Airlines employees at Ataturk airport in the face of adverse weather conditions. After a 3 hour delay at Johannesburg airport, we arrived too late at Istanbul airport to catch our connecting flight to Birmingham and Ataturk airport was utter chaos and disorganisation. We were sent from one very long queue to another â€“ standing for hours with a 3 year old child after a long international flight â€“ no water was supplied or even available, no hospitality of any kind â€“ just chaos and more chaos. After 6 hours in queues in Ataturk airport, we were finally sent on a long bus ride to a hotel on the very opposite side of the city to the airport â€“ the Ramada Encore.

"Houston to Mumbai via Istanbul return, flying Turkish Airlines for the first time. The outbound trip to India was smooth. But on the way back it was one of the mot horrific experience I had had. We checked in on time as per the rules from Mumbai. The flight was delayed by more than 3 hours. We inquired with he ground staff will we get the connecting flight to Houston from Istanbul, and they said yes. So we were on the way to Istanbul. The flight arrived late. There was nobody at the gate to let us know what we should be doing as your flight connections are not there. We went through the security again and by the time we reached the gate for Houston, they had closed the gate. When inquired with the person there he said gate closed now you go and look yourself what to do. We had no clue where to go. We went inquiring all over the airport, and the people or the staff there kept us sending up and down and left and right. In the end we saw a counter and we stood in that line at least to get in touch with someone authentic to talk to. The lady did not speak proper English, but somehow we got out boarding pass done for the flight for the next day. Now the problem starts, we asked the lady for or hotel stay as we have not missed the flight due to our negligence, but it was due to the airlines mess up. She said go to the hotel counter, but to get there we had to pass through passport control and we needed visa. So we had to pay for the visa which was not acceptable to us, because by now we had lost faith in the staff and the people around. So me and wife decided to stay put at the airport, not realizing the it was snowing and we will get shivery in the night. If you are traveling by Turkish Airlines be careful in Istanbul, as the staff there is very rude, not knowledgeable, and very unprofessional. To top it all my bags did not come on the fight.

"This was the fourth of four legs of a return Turkish Airlines trip from Manchester to Kuala Lumpur via Istanbul, and one I'd like to forget. As a business class customer, priority boarding is promised, but at the gate it was a free-for-all. We eventually boarded but due to a computer problem we were delayed at the stand by almost 2 hours. The business class cabin was atrocious. The front of the cabin near the door was soaked in water, due to rain and a leaking sink. The taps in the sink were out of order so we had to rinse hands using bottled drinking water. Seats were economy style, with the middle seat free. When the passenger in front reclined, there was about 6-8 inches of room between the seat and my head, and the leg room was very cramped, knees touching the back of the seat in front once he reclined. There was no IFE, unless you call a sheet of sudoku puzzles entertainment. There were a few drop down screens which were used for the safety video. The screen was so dark it was impossible to see the images. First drink was served in a plastic cup. I am assuming that many of the passengers in business class were passengers from other cancelled flights, as our seat numbers were changed at the last minute (at the boarding gate). After take off, I waited until the seat belt light had gone off before unbuckling and going to the toilet. Once there the chief steward told me to sit back down as the light was still on - I can only assume he'd turned it off prematurely and then back on again after I'd walked to the toilet. I sat back down and waited for him to turn it off again. One passenger got up while the light was on and used the loo. I complained to the chief steward who said, he was ok to use it as he was about to turn the light off anyway. The same steward told another complaining passenger that if he didn't like the service he was more than welcome to leave the plane. I also complained that the lack of hygiene due to non-functioning washing facilities meant the plane wasn't fit for use. He dismissed my complaint. The leather covering of the raised seat arms were velcro-ed on, but the velcro had worn free leaving exposed dirty undersides. This is in no way business class standard - in fact it was less comfortable than economy (I travelled economy with a group to Kilimanjaro in October - that was a far more pleasant experience, despite a malfunctioning air con system leaving the cabin sweltering). The lounge at Istanbul is impressive, but be warned, the lack of their own lounges at other airports is a negative aspect of the experience. At Manchester, the Aspire lounge was in need of a good clean. At Kuala Lumpur the Premier Plaza lounge was packed to capacity, with lots of children and seats very close together. Wine is not included in the drinks service. Good points for business travellers include dedicated check in section and priority baggage loading and unloading. The lie-flat seats are ok (between Kuala Lumpur and Istanbul) and the food is ok. If you are looking for a true business class experience, I would highly recommend paying a bit more and going with another airline.",Detractor

Turkish Airlines staff employees in Istanbul are arrogant, treat customers badly, speak bad english, scream at customers, don't give concise answers, and are difficult to locate during delays.

"Tel Aviv to Accra via Istanbul. Turkish Airlines does not have its act together. My family was stuck in Istanbul for four days. The first day, we missed our connecting flight because 1 inch of snow caused our flight to be five hours delayed. We wandered around the airport for several hours, looking for employees that could not be found easily. When employees were located, they did not have accurate information to let us know how to deal with our problem. When we finally figured out where we needed to go to get our ticket reissued for the next flight (the following day), we had to wait in a 5-hour line to have it reissued. At the end of the line, our ticket was begrudgingly reissued by rude employees. The flight they rebooked us on was cancelled the next day. That led to more 3-5 hour lines and more rude Turkish Airlines employees. When we came back the next day for our flight, it was overbooked, and they did not get us on the flight. Finally, on day four we were put on a flight and actually arrived at our destination and they lost our luggage. The main problem is that in Istanbul they isolate all of their functions. You cannot go to one desk and get all of the help and information you need. Each desk only has one function and they are not even familiar with the functions of every other desk.

Finally after an hour of arguing with their manager, the 3rd day we got a flight back to Amsterdam at the end of the day. Keep the long story short, instead of having transparency and communicating the issues with the clients, they were hiding the issues, not giving all the choices we had for flying back etc. Just sending us from one desk to another.",Detractor
"We missed our Turkish Airlines flight to Berlin from Istanbul due to the delay from Ankara because of snow fall. When we arrived in Istanbul they transferred us to a further flight, which was again delayed multiple hours. In the return flight there was again a 1 hr delay from Berlin for no appearent reason. They changed our tickets to a later flight for Ankara. I will be surprised if it won't be delayed also.",Detractor
"Beijing to Barcelona via Istanbul on Turkish Airlines. When we arrived at the airport for our 12:50 am flight, we went to check in to learn our flight had been delayed until 430am because the crew had worked overtime. At that point I asked why weren't we notified so we could have stayed at our hotel longer and not have had to sleep at the airport. Their response was that they still had to check everyone in at the normal time, which I find absurd. After waiting for two hours they offered us sandwiches. At 4.30 the pilots had arrived and boarded the plane, remember we were told we'd be taking off at 4.30. 20 minutes later the cabin crew arrived. We didn't start boarding until 5.20. The plane didn't take off until 6, an hour and a half later than what we were told it would be. What bothered me more is that at no point were we apologized to for the inconvenience. I felt completely powerless and mistreated flying with Turkish airlines. I won't ever fly with them again.",Detractor
"Athens to Lyon via Istanbul, and Turkish Airlines is a very bad and unprofessional company when there is trouble. I was stuck in Istanbul because of the snow for 30 hours and got no information, no food or suficient water. It was a total chaos and I had to wait in line for nearly 6hours just to get another plane as my plane was cancelled. Then they lost my luggage and I have no news of it, they keep saying they can't know were it is although I have the luggage number and did the right reclamation. Unbelievable!",Detractor
"I was flying Turkish Airlines from Dubai to Bilbao via Istanbul. Obviously my flight was delayed, as every single flight was with Turkish Airlines. Got to Istanbul and it was a complete chaos when I found out I lost my conection flight. The service provided was terrible, I did not know where to go or who to talk to. After 3 hours of trying to talk to someone in charge, I decided to go to the main office, outside the airport. There, a person found a flight to Paris, and from there to Bilbao. I took 4 flight with turkish, never on time, the service is terrible, and they dont provide solutions to any problem. They wanted to send me back home the next day, but I refused. Obviously I'm never flying with them again.",Detractor
"After snow fall on New Years Eve, on Jan 1st we checked prior driving to the airport the airport departure information and found no information on delays or any problems whatsoever. We then drove through beautiful weather to the airport. There we found total chaos: About 20 to 30 flights had been cancelled. At 11.00 our flight (TK0786 to Tel Aviv at 12.20) was marked as cancelled too, almost all other flights where delayed. The Turkish Airline transfer desk had kilometer-long lines, and after waiting and pushing for many hours, all they did there was copy passports. Then we were sent to the ticket counter, again km long lines. We did finally arrive in Tel Aviv with 11 hours delay. But our luggage had been lost. Now, 3 days later, still no news about our luggage. And guess what, the service number of Turkish Airlines in Tel Aviv is engaged constantly. Durning the 10 hours of queing and being pushed around there was no anouncement of appology, no public appeal through the intercom system, no drinks were offered, no assistance to disabled people was arranged, no special treatment for families with pregnant woman or little children was offered. Turkish Airlines did not seem to make any effort whatsoever to put some substance to their solgan ""we are the most popular airline"". They let their own few staff members who were trying to handle the situation down badly. They had to stand on the table tops and shout into the crowd all day to prevent being squashed by the thousands of people. And now, on Jan 4th in the afternoon our luggage has still not arrived. Any more news!?",Detractor
"Our Turkish Airlines flight from Mombasa to Istanbul (via Addis Ababa) was delayed. On arrival into Istanbul we had to queue for 2 hours to collect our boarding pass for our connecting flight. This meant we missed our connecting flight to London Heathrow. When we finally arrived at the front of the desk the man was very unhelpful and arrogant. He said he could not help us and that we must go to the ticket sales desk to rebook our flight. The process of getting a boarding pass should not take more than 2 hours! We were told that the flight had gone without us and that we must purchase a visa and exit the airport to go to the ticket sales desk to get a new ticket. After a further hour we arrived at the ticket sales office. We then queued for a further 4 hours (where people were fainting, arguing and children were being sick) we finally reached the desk. We were told that there were no flights to anywhere in the UK for 2 more days. Our return destination was not possible so we had to change our return destination to Manchester. After this, we were told we could collect our luggage from the lost luggage area. After waiting a further hour, the staff told us it was impossible to get our bags and were unhelpful. As a result we still have no luggage. After this we had to join the hotel booking queue which took another hour. We have been left with no luggage, no clothes, no toothbrush, no toiletries and no warm clothes in a snowy environment. The customer service for Turkish Airlines at Istanbul airport has been the worst experience of our lives. The airline have been completely disorganised, unhelpful and at times very rude. The staff are unprepared and spoke minimal English. People should not have to wait in queues for hours without being provided water or seating. People with children were not assisted appropriately. We were treated like dogs for a problem that could have been sorted appropriately and efficiently. We hope that our flight tomorrow is on time. We have missed 2 days of work which we want compensation for. We also have a car parked at Heathrow airport (our original destination) which we will have to try and get as our destination was changed due to their incompetence. We will never fly with Turkish Airlines again. I cannot believe they have been voted the best airline in Europe. The way they have treated people is disgusting and an outrage. We hope they are ashamed of their service. We just hope our luggage turns up eventually",Detractor
"Kayresi to Hong Kong via Istanbul with Turkish Airlines. After 33+hrs domestic flight delay plus 2+ hrs international flight delay, I'm home after 50+ hrs - they totally ruined my 2015 New Year eve! Thousand of passengers lining up in front of their counters have similar awful experiences, pointed to wrong line (every line have to line up over a hours or couple of hours), the staff brought up other passengers who can speak Turkish to cut the line, given out wrong information, said they don't speak English after 5 minutes conversation. The rudest staff I have seen among traveled many cities. I will never fly with this horrible airline again!",Detractor
"Flight from Istanbul to Athens on Sunday 12.05, I was unable to use the Automatic check-in, because there was an error message ""No Seats Available"". A kind employee suggested that I should ask at the Administration desks, where of course there were more people waiting from different flights with all kinds of problems, due to the bad weather and cancellations. After about 35 mins, I gave my ID and I was told, even without apologies, that my possibilities to board were 50-50, because I was late to check-in, and there were some extra tickets sold. Further explanations were not given, but my guess is that they thought on this bad weather some people will not make it to the airport (as it happened ) so why can't we sell some extra tickets for more profit? I arrived at the gate and I gave my non-seat Boarding Pass, and I was been told to wait. I discovered that there were 3 more people with the same problem as mine. After the last passenger boarded, we would have to take the bus leading to the airplane, and wait again, until all passengers were counted, so they were making sure that there were available seats. Finally, we were told to enter the plane and take our seats, but this unrest is not justified by an airline such as the one I used. I hope this will be the last time something like that happened.",Detractor
"Dublin to Jakarta via Istanbul. A total shamble, missed the connection at Istanbul due to a slot time for the first flight. Turkish Airlines did not provide direct plane to plane bus transfers. Had they done so many would have been able to make connections. Once inside the terminal the staff rebooked on the next flight 24 hours later. The following night that flight was delayed and delayed. The lounge monitors were inaccurate and the CIP lounge staff incompetent. No information, no announcements, no service. They refused to rebook onto other airlines and failed to deal with customers properly. When we finally got on our way we arrived 34 hours late. As to the long haul flight: avoid the A330-200. The seats are old and uncomfortable (angled and not lie flat) and the IFE is unresponsive. This is not a premium airline. Every time there is a slightest problem Turkish Airlines miserably fail at customer service.",Detractor
"Cairo to Washington DC via Istanbul. We were catching a connecting flight in Istanbul and due to weather conditions, our flight was delayed nearly 4 hours. Once we arrived, we ran to our gate just missing the flight. Bad weather, delays and cancellations can happen to any airline. What was disappointing was how this situation was handled by Turkish Airlines staff. It was total chaos with lack of communication, poor management, and staff unwilling to provide assistance. It was difficult to find someone who could speak English and when you did, they were rude and condescending. We waited for over 7 hours at the transfer desk to get another flight. We were told the airline would provide us with hotel accommodations, but we were shocked at the length of the line requiring another 5 to 6 hour wait. Eventually we paid for our own accommodation. I was horrified by the way customers' escalating anger and in some cases, medical emergencies were handled or in this case, mishandled. While waiting in line, we witnessed at least 3 physical fights, two people who fainted, and customer service representatives who were in desperate need of proper training. I have flown with this airline on two other occasions without problems, but Turkish Airlines certainly cracked under pressure.",Detractor
"The holiday started quite well with our first flight from Manchester to Istanbul with reasonable seats for our 4 hour flight, even though the seat television wasn't working, an ipad solved this problem. We were expecting the same or better for our next flights on the longest leg (9 hours) from Istanbul to Bangkok, but were very disappointed to have less leg room and with the seat in front reclined couldn't even eat the meal properly. On the return flight from Bangkok to Istanbul we were told we would be delayed for 2 hours 30 mins, then held on the runway in Istanbul for a further 30 minutes due to congestion and only just made our connecting flight to Manchester. Unfortunately no luggage made it with the passengers. Both return flights had very little leg room and were the smallest legroom seats we have had on long haul flights - less than 1 hour internal flights within Thailand. The staff were very unhelpful when asked for most basic requests and very rarely smiled. We looked at the reviews for Turkish Airlines and expected a good flight, but were very disappointed. It is now the 3rd of January, some 12 hours after our return and still no news of all of our 6 items of luggage. All in all very disappointing airline.",Detractor

"London to Istanbul. My bag was lost by Turkish Airlines on the 28th of December. Airport staff said my bag would be returned to me the next day. It did not arrive. I was told that it had been given to a company called ABS Kargo. Two days later, the courier called me and I had to get a Turkish friend to talk to him as he spoke no English (not his fault but you'd think Turkish Airlines would use a company that was able to comunicate effectively) and was told he could not find my address. My friend gave the courier my work address and I was assured the bag would arrive the following day. It did not. Days passed and the courier turned his phone off and was not contactable. During this time I was calling Turkish Airlines every day and was told they could not speak to the courier firm on my behalf. I was told every day that my bag would arrive the next day. It did not. Eventually, following complaints on Twitter and by email I was called by Turkish Airlines to say my bag would arrive the following day - the 3rd of January - it did was damaged.",Detractor
"Munich to Singapore via Istanbul. Due to snow in IST all flights were delayed and I missed my connection. Snowfall happens and I understand this is not in the power of the airline. However the way to deal with difficult situations shows the real quality of the airline. Turkish Airlines fails at all levels. Flight is delayed by 4 hours, in reality you have to beg for a voucher, passengers are stuck and TK staff hide from the gates. To get information or vouchers one needs to go back through customs. Delayed arrival at IST airport, missed connection - no information is given, transfer desks have 3hr waiting queues. In reality it took 4 hours between delayed arrival and hotel checkin (at 6am) - surely this process can be improved. Make sure that passenger receive an apology, very simple, cheap and effective but this does not seem within the standards of TK. Overall this situation was very badly managed. Inflight I find Turkish Airlines a good airline but it is the whole customer experience that counts. I have seen other airline who are much more professional and prepared to crisis situations.",Detractor

"I've just had the worst experience of my traveling life, and it is not over. We (a couple and 5 year old) were due to fly out from Istanbul to London Gatwick on Wednesday with Turkish Airlines. Due to what would be a manageable snow storm elsewhere, we were first kept in the airport with a four hour delay. The area we were kept in was very crowded and not equipped to handle thousands of passengers they were bussing to the planes. Then we were kept in the plane for seven hours. Finally we were let off the plane. Once we got back to the airport we had to pass through customs and saw that they had made no allowances for the mess they themselves had created. Nobody seemed to know where we should go or what we should do. Then it was more waiting in various lines to get rebooked. Next day our flight was cancelled again. More lines and hours of waiting to rebook. Turkish Airlines has this ""amazing"" system where one cannot get rebooked at a check-in counter and instead has to go to a special desk called ""ticket sales"" to get rebooked. There are at most 10 of these desks throughout the airport, which were trying to process thousands of passengers yesterday. So after Turkish Airlines cancels your flight, they make you wait in line for hours for the privilege of getting rebooked. The fact that I am an Elite passenger (Star Alliance Gold) made no difference whatsoever. We are still stranded here - no seats available until Wednesday they say. And they make no compensation for hotels or food. Turkish Airlines should be ashamed of itself. After more queuing we managed to file a claim to get our luggage back but thus far no news of that either.",Detractor
"Birmingham to Kuala Lumpur via Istanbul. The second leg from Istanbul to Kuala Lumpur was delayed for 5.5 hours. Queued at the Turkish Airlines care desk for 30 minutes, just to be brought directly to Burger King for a free meal. A free meal is probably OK, but the staff could have been more polite and friendly. He could barely speak English. There is no apology for the flight delay at all, no explanation as to why it was delayed. Really incompetent staff. On the flight, the food and drinks were good. The orange juice was fresh. Choices of movies were plenty. The air stewardess were not the friendliest, but at least they were quite fast in serving, unlike certain other airlines.

The ground staff are few to handle the chaos. There is overbooking to Toronto, so we had to change the booking heading to Montreal instead of Toronto on the next day. The airport hotel is overbooked. The airline did not cover costs of my stay in Istanbul since we have to get in another 3 hrs waiting line just to ask for that, and you have to apply for Turkish visa.

We were well fed and food and drinks were excellent. The cabin attendants were pleasant and friendly. It was an excellent flight. Istanbul Airport was chaotic as usual and since I had a 19 hours connection time I was given a complimentary room at the Grand Cevahir Hotel in the city. I got a visa issued for 30 Euros.

But as usual the handling of the crisis by TK ground services provider TGS was atrocious. Inadequate flight information screens in the lounge.

On board, the usual incomprehensive cockpit announcement, with very little information. No landing cards loaded. The aircraft was one of the leased birds with a mixed cabin configuration in Business Class. I would recommend TK only to burn miles or on very cheap fares.",Detractor

The plane was full of luggage from a week ago, people who had landed a week ago and still hasn't received there luggage. I met people in the airport who had come in days ago also and hadn't gotten there luggage. It is now Saturday, 4 days after I arrived and still no luggage. There has been no apologies from the airline, no compensation, no remorse and a huge bunch of very angry people from various flights still waiting for luggage, wasting money going back and forth to the airport and still nothing.

"Excellent total experience with Turkish Airlines at a very good price from Birmingham to Kathmandu via IST. We booked our own flights with a package holiday. This meant we could fly from our local airport, get seats that were 2-4-2 rather than 3-3-3 for the long flight and save nearly Â£700. It was easy to book window seats on the left for a good view of the Himalayas on the way in - just phone them 99 days before the flight. I got through very easily (in contradiction to what other reviews say) and was treated with respect. No charge for seats. I chose 30A and B for the long flight to be behind the wings - they were good but a few seats further back would have been even better. Complementary food and drinks and was better than most airlines. You even get metal cutlery. Good, clean modern aircraft. Entertainment system worked fine on all 4 flights. Good cabin crew. The leg room was a bit limited on the short flight - as expected. Our flights back were from Delhi via Istanbul - same experience. I would use them again.",Promoter

We were served start to finish before economy was served drinks. (I went to the lav and the curtain was open.) I don't understand that. I paid for more room so I could sleep but not to be treated differently. The entertainment options were very good. I love being able to see out the front of the plane when in the airports. I also liked the hot towel, Turkish Delight, flight bags and blanket but I wish the blanket were washed rather than perfumed. The over-ear headphones were great. Of four flights only one was on time. I didn't miss any connections because the next flight was 2 hours late and I had a very long layover. I spoke with a young man who had an overnight layover in Istanbul. I don't know where he stayed but he sent me a text saying Turkish Air paid for his room! I don't know how comfortable it was but anything is better than the airport overnight!

Cockpit crews hardly communicate with passengers, and no relevant information, such as why a delay -0 only the few foreign pilots let you have the true picture! In addition, Turkish Airlines does not care about feedback any more, let them have our views on this website for next year's rating.",Passive
"We left from Seoul and while flying over Tibet the captain announced that the right wing engine was malfunctioning and that we had to emergency land in Beijing. After waiting on the taxiway for more than an hour and in the airport terminal for almost 2 hours, we were taken to a hotel with no english speaking staff. Because we didn't have a chance to exchange currency, and because it was past dinner time at the hotel, we could not eat. The airline staff also refused to answer questions regarding the plane or when the next flight would leave. The next day, after deciding that no help would come for us to the hotel, some passengers got cabs individually and went to Beijing International Airport, only to wait for another 3 hours until the staff showed up. There were over 100 passengers at the desk by then, and we demanded explanation. The 2 persons who came to represent Turkish Airlines just told us to give them our passports and final destination. My itinerary was 6 days in Turkey and 7 days in Italy. The staff took me and my wife to Lufthansa to board a plane which flew to Munich and then to Venice. They told us that our non-refundable hotel reservations in Turkey would be compensated by Turkish Airlines. That was the one question the staff answered. After we arrived in Venice, our bags did not arrive. They did not arrive for the whole 2 weeks which was the length of our honeymoon. After returning to Seoul, I tried calling Turkish Airlines. Their office in Seoul refused to respond, and their customer service call center in Romania could offer no help.

"Flight was delayed by 4 hours. We got to know it 1 hour before departure. The real reason is that the aircraft supposed to be used for that flight was delayed, coming from Tokyo Narita. How ever, when complaining to apply the European Rules of Civil Aviation, Turkish Airlines says it is ""Operational problems due to airport restriction"", which is beyond their control - they say. I'm really sorry but this is not what I want to hear. If Operational problems are beyond their control, then what is within their control? So they rejected any compensation, eventhough I missed my connection flight in Singapore, I had to spend one night in Singapore instead of taking my connecting flight to Denpasar, Bali. Really dissapointed on the fact that Turkish Airlines, even I am a very regular flyer with them, does not assume it's responsibility.",Detractor
"This was a Turkish Airlines connection flight on my way back from HKG (so HKG-IST-BRU). The last flight, IST-BRU, was really dissapointing (especially after a so good flight from HKG to IST). The airplane supposed to be used for that particular flight was normally, as every day, an A330-200 with their Business seat flat-bed, angle-free, 2x2x2 configuration. But unfortunately, in late minute, their plan changed. Probably due to the fact that the plane was not full at all (even the replacement plane, A321). The big dissapointement was when we entered this A321. It was a very old one, in 3x3 configuration, with no real business seat. So even we paid really expensive business class ticket, we got seated in Economy Seat, with the ""chance"" that we were only 2 person in a 3 seat row. But the leg-space was still really tight, and seat really narrow. Bad service, old plane, no screen or inflight entertainment, really bad seating for that price. In this case, I'm really wondering why paying 4 times the price of an economy ticket, while you get offered the exactly same service?! Expecting some answers from Turkish Airlines about that point.",Detractor

"I flew 10 international and 2 domestic flights with Turkish Airlines this year and they will likely be my last. Sure their planes are nice and new, but their service is getting worse every time I fly. Their customer service (online or via phone) has been pretty bad for a while, but now it's spreading to their in-flight services. The hostesses behave rudely to passengers raising their voices. They don't come right away when you push the call button. I waited an hour to get a cup of water on my last flight. This is unacceptable. The food on board used to be better. In the past I would actually look forward to eating it, but lately their food quality is slipping. On my last trip I wanted chicken but they ran out by the time they came to my row. Istanbul Ataturk Airport is very poorly operated. We are constantly transported by bus to and from the planes rather than boarding at a gate. My last trip it was raining and we got wet getting off the plane. The in-flight entertainment is decent. They have plenty of movies to watch, but not so many TV shows. I've flown so many times in 2015 that I actually ran out of things to watch. They need to update their library more often.",Detractor
"Gatwick to Seoul via Istanbul. My husband had flown with Turkish Airlines recently and had glowing reports, I was pleased to have had a similarly good experience. Seats in economy were very comfortable in all sectors and it was great to have IFE for the IST-LON routes. On our flight out, a passenger appeared to have passed away on the inbound IST-LGW flight so the flight was delayed by an hour. No information was given at LGW, but I was one of the few who might have figured out what had happened and I expect that most passengers would be more comfortable not knowing. Crew were welcoming and friendly but there were no forced smiles. It couldn't have been a great day for them but they showed utmost professionalism throughout the journey. Food was excellent, there was plenty to drink, flight was full. Not many toilets for Economy passengers, but they were well maintained and kept clean. Many of the passengers would not have made their connecting flights. I had a two hour transit window which was reduced to one hour. I walked purposefully (did not need to clear any security for this particular journey) and got to my gate as passengers were boarding. It was a long walk. I do not recommend a transit time of less than 2 hours with Turkish Airlines here. The next flight was also very full in economy but my seat was extremely comfortable and I appreciated the foot rests. Entertainment options were even more extensive than on my earlier flight. Food, again, was fantastic. I doubt any airline gives you better food in economy (better than some Business Class meals I've had). Unfortunately, about a third of the way into the flight I became ill. The crew swooped into action, called amongst the passengers for medical assistance and I had my pulse and blood pressure checked. Business class was a lot less busy than Economy and I was isolated from other passengers in a business class chair that had been turned into a bed for me. The crew kept a check on my throughout the rest of the flight and kept me hydrated. The worst of my illness passed by the time we arrived over South Korea and I took myself back to my Economy chair for landing. Thanks to the crew, I was left in a fit state to continue my journey (just needed an extra sick bag for the road). The flight back was less eventful but standards were just as high. The flight from ICN to IST was delayed by an hour. Again, I had a two hour transit window that was halved and I arrived at my gate for the IST-LHR flight as it was boarding. I really enjoyed my flights and appreciated the care and service I was given. I don't hesitate to recommend this airline but I do stress how important it is to have a long enough transit window to deal with an unforeseen delay. My husband will be travelling with TK again in January and is looking forward to it.",Promoter

"Istanbul to Zagreb on Turkish Airlines. Flight was smooth, we were little bit late with take-off because of very strong cross winds this day. Flight attendants were polite, but I noticed some of them are very bad in English. Turkish Airlines do not let passengers use headphones during take-off and landing. Flight attandant was angry with me, because she came 3x to tell me that I have to stop using my iPhone (on airlplane mode) during landing and take off - but on some other airlines this is allowed. Food and beverages are above other airlines economy class, so I can say Turkish Airlines have best Economy class. Inflight entertaiment was nice, 4 or 6 music channels, and some documentary was playing on LCD.",Promoter

"I flew Turkish Airlines business class from IST-YYZ, a 10+ hour flight. The in-flight entertainment system did not work throughout the flight. While overall service was decent, there seems to be an excessive focus on facilities that matter less (eg: on-board ""chefs""), than ensuring basic functionality on a long-haul flight. I would imagine that having a working IFE system would be critical regardless of class of service flown. Still surprised that no one from Turkish has either followed-up on my feedback from the in-flight survey they requested, or bothered to offer any sort of apology / refund / discount on the next flight, etc. Poor level of service on all counts.",Detractor
"San Francisco to Milan via Istanbul with Turkish Airlines. Check in was a nightmare. The gate employee didn't communicate seat information, and didn't respond to my concern that my bag would get lost (as it did twice in the past with Turkish Airlines). I spoke with two different managers on basic questions of Turkish Airlines policy, and they were just rude. Each of them asked me to repeat all the information I had already provided (an annoyingly obvious tactic to tire the customer), and then proceeded to quote policy unrelated to my question. Besides saying sir as if it were a four-letter word, and twice rolling their eyes (two different managers) with accompanying tone of condescension, one manager asked me ""are you on medication?"" Terrible service. Terrible quality. A mean, cynical, and dismissive handling of the customer. So much for Turkish Airlines Gold Premier service!

"Turkish Airlines from Delhi to Boston via Istanbul. I need assistance in the form of wheel chair for significant distance and have difficulty climbing stairs. I was traveling from Delhi to Boston on Nov 26th in seat 2D. When I arrived in Istanbul plane was parked well away from the gate. It took sometime to deplane us, in the lift there were more people than wheel chairs. I was offered to sit on stretcher which was too low to sit down. After coming to the gate the chair was provided. After significant time a chair arrived and again we were parked at a different place, finally we were picked up and arrived in the lounge 45 minutes latter. While my time for departure came no body showed up so I went to the desk and they called, they came 15 minutes before boarding time. There was no lift to take us to plane which was parked about a mile away and it was raining.The porter asked me to go three flights down on slippery steps while he took hand luggage. He placed me in the bus and said somebody will help me on getting in the plane. On arrival I walked to the stairs with my carry on and started looking for help.

I was only left at the bottom of the stair and having no help started to climb, while half way up a passenger took my carry on.",Detractor

I told cabin staff after the safety brief, who called the flight manager, checked under my seat and struggled to find a replacement, but finally got a life jacket from an empty business class seat. An uneventful flight despite being very delayed in Istanbul and catching my London flight with only minutes to spare. I always listen to the safety brief, check the nearest exit, the number of seats between me and the exit, and for the life jacket. The disappearance of life jackets is common among airlines as people have been known to steal them as a souvenir.",Passive
"Houston to Budapest via Istanbul. I'm so glad I went with Turkish Airlines despite negative reviews. My flight was a late night, departure at 2205. I arrived at Bush 8:30pm there was virtually no line. Check in staff polite and courteous and felt genuine. Then it 15min to go through security to my gate. When entering the plane staff greeted everyone, making eye contact as they said hello. I was in seat 11K right in front of the bulkhead. My entertainment monitor was not working so I hit my attendant bell twice and no came, I had to wait 4ins after take off before I could flag someone down to come and take my complaint. Seat was not extremely spacious, I had a lot of leg room, food was actually good, free snacks, alcoholic beverages. Pillow and blanket, were already at the seat.

I waited bit longer and the steward didn't remember where was my seat, and when I called again he suddenly gave me the tea and dropped tea and the sugar over me without apologising anything.

No comunications from the airline on what to do, in the air or in the Airport. Running around like a headless chicken trying to get another flight.

"Chicago to Dusseldorf via Istanbul. This was a classic case of high expectations colliding with miserably poor performance. I looked forward to the flight because I love Turkish food and have experienced the wonderful hospitality of the Turkish people. I flew to Istanbul and noticed I was invisible to Turkish Airlines staff. They focused their attention on their Turkish customers. I had a coat and draped over my knees and no one asked to hang it. After about an hour on my knees I finally asked someone to hang it. They also have an elaborate bed-making ritual that begins with a blue packet containing a pillow, blanket etc. They made the beds of their Turkish clientele, but my seat did not even have this packet, nor was I asked if I wanted my bed to be made. The food, however, was excellent. From Istanbul to Dusseldorf I experienced something I've only experienced in third-world travel: Flies. A host of flies bothered us the entire way. As they delivered trays of food, flies alighted on the food as it was being handed to us or placed on our trays. The return trip was worse. Flies again plagued us from Dusseldorf to Istanbul. But the worst service came with the person who issued boarding passes. She asked me if I wanted an aisle seat, and I said yes. I then added, ""I flew bulkhead from Istanbul to Dusseldorf and do not want to fly bulkhead again."" Her response ""Of course."" Imagine my shock when I discovered my 12 hour flight from Istanbul to Chicago was a bulkhead middle seat. What sort of perversity leads a person to ask a traveler, ""Would you like an aisle seat,"" and then give them a middle seat? Or acknowledge the bulkhead's lack of desirability, and then placing the passenger there for 12 hours? Turkish Airlines should come with this warning. No matter how cheap they make the cost of your flight, it is not worth it. The customer processing system went out of order in Istanbul prior to the flight to Chicago. Every ticket was manually logged using pen and paper. So, they held up the boarding of the flight, and sent down segments. Normally, you would expect the business class to go first, followed by the business class. Not in Turkey. The most important quality a passenger can have is being Turkish. So, the people who boarded first were people whose trip originated in Istanbul. Meaning, about 90% of the first boarders were locals. Then, once we encountered those who were checking boarding passes, complete chaos reigned. If I can avoid flying Turkish Airlines I will. It is just not worth the pain and perverse customer service.",Detractor
"Turkish Airlines first Cape Town - Istanbul direct flight, followed by a connection to London. Previously there was an hour on the ground in Jo'burg. Check-in was efficient and friendly. We flew business but there was no lounge (initially seated in CIP and then advised that this was not for Turkish) and were seated at a sectioned off area of the public restaurant. The greeting and food on board is very good but the service is incredibly slow. From boarding to getting a glass of wine took 2 hours. The seats were the most uncomfortable business seats I have experienced. They are not flat and the bottom section is flexible - horrible. My entertainment system was temperamental. On the return flight the toilet floor was really dirty. The Istanbul London leg was on a different model of plane with good seats and entertainment system. I am not sure if I would book Turkish Business Class again. All four legs were delayed.",Passive
"Nuremberg to Izmir via Istanbul. This was the second time I flew with Turkish Airlines the same route and the second time we left more than 2 hours late from Nuremberg. Thus the connecting flight was impossible to be reached in time as you have to cross Istanbul AtatÃ¼rk Airport and pass again baggage checks and passport control. The ground staff was inpolite and not communicative - they just issued another ticket for the next plane and surrendered it without a single word. I wrote to Turkish Airlines and explained the situation - they would check and come back to me. Reminding them about the outstanding complaint several times I received an unreadable standard excuse 4 weeks later and they would be glad to welcoming me again. Talking to friends who also came via Turkish Airlines from other German destinations I found that they encountered the same problems at this Airport. Turkish Airlines simply ignores time problems and is unable to organize a smoother transit in Istanbul. Definitely choose another airline for my frequent trips to Izmir. By the way, should you raise your complaint via Facebook - you will be friendly invited to use your individual case number on their website and never hear from them again. What a polished way to ease complaints.",Detractor
"Turkish Airlines from Tokyo to Brussels via Istanbul. Seats are OK, food and service is above standard. Main negative point is that on daytime flights from Asia to Europe they make the cabin fully dark for +8 hours.

"Istanbul to Casablanca with Turkish Airlines. Check in was easy, and dedicated passport queue perfect. Boarding process was painful, as the ground services staff tried to squeeze as many passengers onto the bus as possible. The bus driver drove quite fast and turned corners really fast which made some passengers collide with each other creating an unsafe situation. The onboard experience was okay apart from the very limited entertainment. The inflight entertainment had only a few movies and tv shows and didn't reflect the usual offering. Food was fine and cabin crew were mostly friendly. Some instructions on how to open and lock the toilet door and to flush the toilet in the safety video would be really helpful for flights to Middle East and North African countries because many passengers on these flights have trouble to perform these tasks. I think this would make the passenger experience better and assist the Flight Attendants.",Passive
"Travelled from New York JFK to Dubai via Istanbul with Turkish Airlines. The comfort in Business Class is not bad, but on the shorter flights from/to Istanbul/Dubai (A330), the seat does not properly recline to a 180 degree position. As far as service is concerned, Turkish Airlines is trying, but just not getting there. That a meal consist of 3 courses is not too difficult to understand, so why some passengers ended up (on each flight!) with a starter but no ""afters"" or vice versa is not clear to me. Also, when your glass or cup is empty, it is usually promptly taken away (instead of offering a refill). Because of its competitive price, Turkish Airlines is definitely worth considering, but make some allowances. Check in in Istanbul is totally chaotic. No difference between business and economy passengers, and if you have children or need a wheelchair, don't expect any preference (because you don't get it).",Passive

"Istanbul to Washington. I've flown business class on Turkish Airlines many times, and almost on every flight it's the same experience. Airport, lounges, seats, and entertainment system are good, but service is mediocre or bad, ie. boarding process, through the flight, and customer service. On this flight, boarding was messy and chaotic. Once we took off I tried to watch a movie but the screen kept shifting between modes and disrupting the movie. The attendant had no idea what to do. He tried restarting but that didn't fix anything. He didn't offer any apologies or even a fake attempt to compensate through special courtesy service. One good aspect was free wi-fi for business class travelers. I must say that's a feature that I was immensely thankful for especially with my malfunctioning screen. And the wi-fi worked without a hitch throughout the flight. Turkish Airlines may aspire to be a top-tier airlines, but its service is far from reaching that level.",Passive

"We flew Birmingham to Istanbul, onto Male and the same back again. I can honestly say I have never encountered such rude, unhelpful, inattentive cabin crew and that was on all flights. Our plane had a technical fault and we had to land soon after take off on the first leg of our journey. There was a complete lack of information due to the announcement's being unintelligible. We had to ask for water as we sat on the tarmac for nearly three hours and no refreshment was forthcoming. We missed our connecting flight and found cabin crew and ground crew incredibly unhelpful. We were treated badly at the airport and had to fight to get our luggage for the 24hr delay. We needed our luggage for medical supplies. We were also charged $20 a person (11 of us) for Turkish visas even though we were only there for a night and due to no fault of our own. The Hotel was adequate for the night but again we found the staff rude and inefficient. When we eventually got to Male one of our parties suitcase was ripped and torn and my husbands luggage didn't arrive. This caused us a whole new set of problems again because of medical needs.

Catering was plentiful and excellent on all flights with a frequent drinks service. Amenity kits in economy class. Upon checking in in at Bangkok for the return leg, the check-in staff gave us back a make up bag which they had found left behind at our seat on our inbound flight. All flights on time - the scale of their operation from Istanbul is mind blowing. If I have to complain it would be the ground handling in Istanbul - we were a group of 5 and because of a rescheduling, our pre assigned seats had gone.

"In the past 3 years I have flown Turkish Airlines 3 times. Each experience was worse than the one before. My main issue was the attitude and rudeness of staff. The staff also had a hard time understanding and speaking English. The ladies in their customer service call center are unhelpful and one was very rude. I had to call several times due to many issues, and each phone call was much longer than it should be because of the language barrier and their unwillingness to simply do their job. The business lounge at Istanbul airport is beautiful - made ugly by the rude staff. Extremely unhelpful. A man beside us asked for the wi-fi password (after he just sat down, unpacked, hooked up his electronics) and the lounge staff rudely told him to go ask at the desk. The wi-fi password was on a table tent on the very table. Close to my flight time, I went to ask the concierge about my boarding time and flight gate (since it wasn't on the ticket), she pointed at the ticked in my hand and condescendingly asked ""you cannot read?"". I explained its not on it. She said she didn't know and I should go outside to the Turkish airlines desk and ask.

I wanted Orange juice and that was also finished. There was no apology, just a simple, ""Its finished"". I returned the vegetarian pasta and nothing else was given as a supplement. Online check in service did not work for me. Maybe because I got my ticket through a travel agency, I could not do online check in. I was then given a seat that was a bit tight ( I am 6 ""4). I asked the desk officer on my departure if I could be given a better seat, possibly an exit and he said ""My boss will query me if I give you"". He ended up giving me because I appealed and shortly before take off, he came and gave me another boarding pass in the lounge reminding me he told me he could get into trouble for assisting me.

I found Turkish Airlines tickets with a very competitive rate of only 170â‚¬ to fly to Istanbul with my wife and son. A new A320 with very comfortable seats. We flew with our 5 months old son so just after boarding was completed we asked a crew member if there was a free seat somewhere else. Fortunately one seat three rows behind us was free so the flight attendant asked the passenger sitting next to us to change the sit there. So we had three seats for us and our son hadn't to sit on the lap. Food was excellent. Prior to the main menu a Piece of turkish lokum has been served which was delicious.

Checked in early for my flight at Vnukovo Airport. Good advice from the Turkish Airlines Office about changing my second flight. First flight took off and landed on time. A good meal was served shortly after takeoff. The second flight was going to be late (notified when checking in) and was even later. I was asleep before the flight took off and when I woke up later I was served dinner - it was sub standard for a business class meal. Luggage came off relatively early but my suitcase was wet and some of the contents were also wet (I managed to get things dry that day in Kathmandu).

"I have always been a frequent traveler with Qatar Airways whenever possible. But this summer me and my wife decided to travel to Istanbul for a week long holiday and decided to try out Turkish Airlines. What a bad choice it was. Right from the start of the journey, all the flights were late. From CPH to IST, it was delayed by 3 hours and no explanations were provided. However it brought us to Istanbul in one piece and along with the luggage, so that was a bit or relief. The seat was good but the food was barely ok, as I don't think they were particularly fresh. But it was on our return trip they broke all the expectations. To begin with, the flight was delayed again by 3 hours. The ground staff were very rude and barely spoke English. We had some fragile items, which were properly packed, tagged and labeled. In addition to that, we had put on the Turkish Airlines fragile stickers as required by the ground staff. But it never arrived with us to CPH. After investigating, it was told to us that it was not loaded and will arrive next day. But when it arrived, it was not in one piece. One third of the things were broken and there were clear sing of mishandling and wear and tears as the package was scraped. We took pictures of the broken materials and the ripped package instantly in front of the delivery person and sent it to Turkish Airlines. But alas, it was of no use. They ignored our complaint. Not even replying to our email initially. We tried to call to the HQ in Istanbul and then they said they will look into it and later replied that they dont have any responsibility towards it, as it is fragile item so the owner bears the risk of any damage and not the Airlines. I have flown with many other Airlines in my quest of travelling over 50 countries but never have faced such poor customer service. I will never fly with them again.",Detractor
"Istanbul to Malta with Turkish Airlines. Professional on board, but not so much on the ground, staff are slow and rude at times.I arrived early as I was told the lines are incredible! Plane more or less new, with a lot of legroom. Onboard service is great, food is great, flight left on time, no video on demand, I would recommend them for connections only and if the price is right cause they are pricey!",Promoter
"My wife and I flew in Turkish Airlines premium economy from Toronto to Istanbul. Boarding was orderly and the flight left on time out of YYZ. Service on the outbound flight was good and the larger premium economy seats which recline allowed us to sleep on this night time flight. Food was above average. However, the return flight was not nearly so happy. The flight out of Istanbul was delayed (which happens) and there was chaos in the waiting hall. Then it turned out that the aircraft wasn't able to come to the bridge which meant we had to be bussed to the plane which was in the cargo area a long distance from the terminal. The ground crew never explained to us why the airplane couldn't come to the bridge. So all of the passengers had to walk to the end of the bridge and down fairly steep metal stairs to the tarmac. There were a number of elderly women who had a very difficult time negotiating the stairs and, so far as I could tell, they never got any assistance from airline staff. I ending up helping one older lady down the stairs. The return flight is during the day and after serving us a quite acceptable meal the flight attendants disappeared for about 6 hours. Based on my experience, I am not quite sure how Turkish earns the title of best airline in europe.",Passive
"Baku to Istanbul with Turkish Airlines. Yet again another late arrival at Istanbul Ataturk and no apology as usual. Always a bus to the terminal. Plane was hot and though pleased to have a TV, the headphones were crackling as system hanging out.

"Lahore to New York via Istanbul. I made sure before travelling Business class on Turkish Airlines that I will get a wide body plane in which the seat made into a flat bed, but they switched the Lahore to Istanbul plane to a 737 with narrow seats that did not make into bed. At Istanbul missed my connecting flight because the gate did not show on the Business Class monitors till late, and when I reached the gate they told me the passengers were just put on the last bus to the airplane and they could not get me on the plane. The staff was rude and unfriendly and told me that for me to get the next flight I had to get a visa and then go outside to the the ticketing office located in the airport and then re-enter. The Business Class help desk could not get me the boarding card for the next flight though I was paying them for the 350 euros for the new ticket. I had to change the date on my return flight and Turkish Airlines agent told me to they could not do it on the phone, and I had to come to their office which was a two hours drive, and it took them one hour to re-issue the new ticket at a cost of $105 surcharge. This airline has bad customer service and when I sent them a writtem complaint, they took two months to answer and said they are not at fault for any of my suffering.",Detractor
"Gatwick to Istanbul with Turkish Airlines was over 90 minutes late on outbound meaning I thought I'd miss connecting flight to Tbilisi, but somehow made it as the onward flight itself was about an hour late because of congestion at Istanbul Sabiha which seems not uncommon. Return flights were on time, in fact early into Gatwick. Planes comfortable and clean but food and beverage service just about adequate, nothing at all special. Tbilisi to Istanbul Sabiha was 0710 departure and breakfast was salad, roll and chocolate mousse, not at all appetising at that time of day. Crews friendly enough but only seemed to be 2 of them working in economy so meal service took forever. There was no separate drinks service and then meal on the longer flights to and from London, all served in one go. Got me there and back comfortably enough at reasonable fare but not quite up to what they trumpet themselves as being.",Passive
"Flew Turkish Airlines business class on this seven hour journey. The plane was old and the Business class seat was a little worn out. It was not a lie flat seat, and the controls were manual not powered. There was a push up foot rest, and the seat back could be pushed back at least to a 45 degree angle for snoozing. The seat width was okay, but overall not very relaxing experience. Lucky for us we flew during the daytime because I would have trouble sleeping well if it was a night flight. The food was adequate, not my taste. The cabin crew was very attentive though. One of the staff was dressed up in a chef's white tunic with white cap. He looked a bit out of place inside the cabin.",Passive

"Seoul to Toronto via Istanbul on October 20th 2015. First flight on Turkish Airlines Boeing 777-300 departure at 23:50. Rude Swissport staff handled the check-in. They informed me that they could not tag my luggage all the way to Toronto because my second flight was on Air Canada despite both airlines being part of Star Alliance and having code share agreement on the IST-YYZ flight. Sent to the China Eastern Lounge, nothing fancy about the lounge except an interesting cheese plate : a pile of Kraft Singles slices with Ritz crackers around it. Boarded the flight at 23:10. Comfort Class premium economy almost empty, seat rather comfortable except for the leg rest that is low. Two good meals on the 11 hour flight. We landed early at 4:45am in Istanbul. I had to collect my luggage that was not tagged directly to Canada. At passport control I was informed that a Transit Visa does not exist and that I needed to buy a 60$ / 90 days visa. I paid for the Visa, collected my bag and was out of customs in 10 minutes. I then went upstairs to the check-in area to find a deserted area with every seat crowded with people sleeping. Again, due to Turkish Airline stupid baggage rule, I had to wait from 5 am to 7:50 am for the Air Canada counter to open. I was checked-in to my preselected business class seat and baggage tagged in 45 seconds. I then went to passport control once again and waited for AC811 to Toronto. This very bad customer service experience really discredits Star Alliance.",Detractor
"Toronto to Rome via Istanbul. I have flown many other airlines Business Class previously, and never have I received the great service as on Turkish Airlines. Staff were courteous and efficient, and they went out of their way to speak English to us. As mentioned earlier the food was delicious, served with attention to taste, and appearance. Since I was travelling with my husband I was delighted to be able to sit beside him rather than separated or angled away from him. My flight from Toronto to Istanbul was wonderful as was my flight the next day from Istanbul to Rome. I will fly Turkish Airlines again.",Promoter
"My wife and I and baby daughter (1 year old) flew with Turkish Airlines from Dublin to Dammam via Istanbul in September. When I initially booked our flight I was informed basinettes could not be booked in advance but would be allocated at check-in. At Check-in at Dublin airport all basiinettes for the first leg of our journey from Dublin to Istanbul had already been taken which was annoying but ok with us. However, the second leg of the journey from Istanbul to Dammam, we were informed by the check-in person that she was unable to allocate the basinette seats for us since it had been 'closed' out from her system, even though this flight wasn't due to depart for another 13 hours. We were allocated seats for the second leg in row 29. On boarding the second flight I noticed that one set of basinettes seats were occupied by a man and woman who had no child with them. I brought this to the attention of the nearest cabin crew and she informed me that she would notify the senior purser. Of course nothing happened, no one came to me, no one offered an apology or an explanation. I made an online complaint about this and other issues also, to Turkish Airlines but got nowhere with them",Detractor
"Turkish Airlines is one of my favorites they provide good service good food and the best lounge. However, today I'm sitting in TK Istanbul lounge now I just came from London for an 8 hour transit to Los Angeles and I was shocked that they will not provide me with a room to rest because I'm supposed to be on a seven or five hour staying period. But yet they will book me a hotel room outside the airport. Very ridiculous and it make no sense. It's 6:28am and I have been here since 4:30am. Very tired and sleepy and I have 5 more hours to go. This is not acceptable I paid so much money for my comfort not for my stress. What's the difference between a business class and an economy ticket if we both are sleeping on chairs in the airport now.",Passive
"Entebbe to London via Istanbul. Loading at Entebbe was late and when got down to the airport apron a Turkish Airlines agent rushed up and asked what we were doing. The answer was, unsurprisingly, boarding the plane. He informed us all abruptly we should not be boarding and ushered us back to the door area we had just come out of. He told us to wait. It was pouring with rain. After 30 mins the passengers were wandering around the apron area (which was unsafe) while the aircraft was still being prepared (passengers who started their journey in Kigali had a one-and-half hour trust at Entebbe on the plane - that must have been a joy. Totally unprofessional attitude from the Turkish Airlines ground staff. On getting on the plane my seat, and other seats, in business class were covered in spare blankets and pillows. I asked for my seat area to be tidied up - I was glared and growled at by the steward. ""Do it yourself"" he said - I suggested that he should tidy the seat area for his passengers. Snack served if wanted after take off, but as was 4.00am most people slept. Breakfast was served just before landing. The transfer at IST was the usual shambles - other have reported on this. The flight Istanbul to London was OK. Food was good, but I just can't work out what the Chef on Board does. They don't cook anything. The airline moves people from A-B - it does not do it with a smile or grace. The advertisements the airline churn out obviously are very successful in that they have promoted a shoddy and smileless airline into a global brand. The airline has to depend on more than just good food - it has to be known for efficiency and friendliness of service on hte ground and in the air. Small bonus I arrived at LHR along with my luggage.",Detractor
"I am disappointed with Turkish Airlines. Long bus ride to airplane at Istanbul airport. Lack of usual Business Class priority on bus ride and other services. Don't know why need a flight chef when my food was not acceptable. IFE Screen not working from Istanbul to HK. Lost my luggage on flight from Istanbul to Vienna, and forgot to put priority tags on my luggage. Flight Attendants talk loudly in middle of the night which woke me up.

I have to climb over my next person in order go to washroom.",Detractor
"It had been a long time I flex Turkish Airlines. I must say it was quite the disappointment. From ZRH to IST, I was in a plane which had an interior that must have come from the early 80's. Staff not very friendly and they do not speak very good English either. Food was good. Next leg was IST to ICN. Boarding was dramatic. Entering a bus that was fully packed. Privileges for Business Class passengers were absent and after a long bus ride, you can walk up to the plane. Business Class setup is 2-3-2, so luckily I did not book late which most likely would have resulted in being boxed in in the middle. Staff and food was consistent with the first leg. Not too friendly, poor English and good food. Seats are good, Flight entertainment average. The only thing that was exceptional (truly 5 stars) was the business lounge at IST airport.",Passive

"We had a great experience on Turkish Airlines. We did went from Chicago to Istanbul to Budapest. The long haul flight was about 10 hours getting there and 11 coming back. I thought the service on the plane was great. We received snacks once the plane got in the air, hot towels, then a sleeping kit (socks, eyecover, slippers, toothbrush), dinner, then another meal about 2 hours before arrival. They handed out bottles of water periodically. We found the service to attentive and the entertainment options were endless. Every seat had big monitors with remotes. I would give them an 8/10--- the 2 missing points for the service outside of the actual flight. We couldn't print boarding passes at home, and waited about 45 minutes for bags once we arrived back at ORD. Additionally, we booked far in advance and couldn't view seats online and had to call customer service to pickout seats etc. That was a hard phone call given the accents etc.",Promoter
"We took off from Istanbul airport with 4 hours delay, instead of at 2:05AM, finally at around 6:00AM. But the main problem was the communication about the delay at the airport. They officially announced the 1 hour delay but when after the after 2 hours delay nothing happened the admitted the longer delay without saying anything about the cause. So during the whole 4 hours period of delay the passengers were kept at the gate without saying even a word of apology, without offering even the drink for refreshment, without even saying about the length and the reason of delay. On top of this the entertainment system onboard the plane was working just for the some passengers. The others were unlucky. We were a family of four and just 2 of us the system worked. The cabin crew just stated "" Sorry, it is an old aircraft"". Because of this approach towards the customers and because we missed also the following plane from Jakarta we raised a complaint but were completely refused. So Turkish Airlines never more.",Detractor

"Rome to Istanbul, and when this flight landed a number of passengers go out of their seats, opened the overhead bins and commenced to remove luggage she the aircraft was only 5 minutes onto the taxi area. In all about 15 passengers were involved. The crew did nothing. No crew member even appeared to this mayhem unfolding and putting safety at risk. To make matters worse the cabin lights had been turned off (it was an early evening arrival) and the cabin was in semi darkness. These passengers commenced to move down the aircraft luggage in hand while the plane was moving to the gate. Finally, the head steward decided to issue a direction to them to return to their seats. This was ridiculous as she still had the annoying music playing and the cabin lights turned off. Finally after about another 5-7 minutes most of the passengers returned to their seats. The cabin staff failed to recognise the potential danger and take action. I was so angry that I let the captain know as I was departing the aircraft. Turkish Airlines, please take passenger safety seriously and train cabin staff how to deal with this type of behaviour.",Detractor
"Turkish Airlines has good food, but the service could do with a bit of revamp. A smile in any language goes down well. Seems that Turkish Airlines depends on surly service. My luggage did not make it through the chaotic transfer at Istanbul Ataturk Airport and is still to arrive at Entebbe. The transfer at Istanbul is a shambles that does not reflect well on the airline or the image of Turkey. The first flight from London to Istanbul was a half full business class cabin with a flat bed. The six hour flight from Istanbul to Entebbe was in a very small and cramped business class cabin. No flat bed which was odd given the length and timing of the flight. On both flights crew vanished behind their curtain (which seemed important for them to keep firmly closed) to talk loudly after the food and drink service only to show their faces again when getting the plane ready for landing (curtain pulled back at the very possible last minute). Not sure the point of the Chef on board. Turkish Airlines use of the United Airlines lounge at Heathrow Terminal 2 which is lucky, given the 15-20 minute walk from the security area, near the TK boarding gate. No time to sample the lounge at Ataturk Airport given the botched transfer. Turkish Airlines ground handling agent at Entebbe Airport are well used to, it seems, dealing with multiple passengers with lost luggage. Three agents working on Turkish Airlines baggage issues at 3am! Not too sure how the airline wins awards. Seems to get passengers from A-B (in my case without luggage) without style or common courtesy. A poor reflection on Turkey's usually very friendly service industry.",Detractor
"This was the second time I flew Turkish Airlines. The first time which was a coule of years ago was not great but no complains. This time it was bad. The seat did not recline and the movie I was watching was cut off mid-viewing. By the time they were able to rectify it, we were ready to land. Upon arrival, the luggage took forever to come out. Customarily, first and business class luggages should come out earlier. There were no difference on the domestic leg between Isranbul and Kayseri. Turkish Arlines need to renew their fleet.",Passive

The cabin staff spoke no German (on a route from Germany to Turkey) and little English, misunderstanding simple requests. Attendant call buttons went unanswered on several occasions. The food was of poor quality and only Turkish wine or French wine was offered. What the lady dressed as a chef was doing I really don't know.",Detractor

I have to travel with a 30kg box of test equipment and they do not know what to do with it. I had to go to the Turkish Airlines sales counter and check in counter 4 times before they got it right. If you ever have to call them, be sure to block off half your day to be on the phone and the other half to go to the sales office and half the next day to get it right. Terrible airline!",Detractor
"From boarding to deplaning, this is a very good airline. From reservations to boarding however, this is a poor airline. Shortcomings include a very weak online reservation system in that I could not select seats. I had to call three times to select seats - unacceptable! When you arrive or depart from IST, you may be transported to/from your plane via a bus. Upon arrival or deplaning of your aircraft, you have to navigate a flight of stairs exposed to the weather. Despite what airline staff tell you, if you are connecting through IST, you must leave yourself a bare minimum of 90 minutes to make your flight. Due to the possible great distance from one gate to another, at least 15 minutes transit time from your plane to the gate via their bus system, the lack of people movers, and the overcrowding of the airport itself, you risk missing your flight if you allow less than 90 minutes between flights. TK does not use a rope system similar to the one you encounter passing through security, at their check in desk and you can wait a very long time for what should be a quick process. Personal experience with connecting from arrival until I reached Gate 226 for my connecting flight (very last gate in the airport) took 50 minutes and I was allotted 60 minutes. Thus, I had difficulty finding a place for my one carry on piece.",Detractor
"We have been travelling Turkish Airlines business class from New York/Boston to Dhaka via Istanbul for the last three years. The timing suits us, and service had also been reasonably good. But the service had been going downhill for the last year. You don't get a boarding bridge at Istanbul, the airport is so chaotic. On June 4, 2015 we were scheduled to fly from Boston. We had fully confirmed business class tickets. When we arrived at the airport, we saw an incredible scene. The passengers and check in crew were shouting at each other, very close to an all out fight. Apparently, the airline had overbooked the business class and was unable to provide seats to us all. It got very ugly and the Turkish Airlines supervisor was trying to persuade passengers to either fly economy class or fly the next day. Very ugly situation because so many people were involved. They offer discount online and overbook, hoping there will be some last minute cancellation. When there are no cancellations, people are asked to fly economy or fly next day. Apparently, these happen quite frequently in Boston. Anyway, to get to my experience, we did not get our seat. They offered us hotel and flew us the next day. Faced with no alternative, we had to accept their offer and we flew the next day. Turkish Airlines also promised token compensation of money back, and double mileage earned. If overselling is truly their business model, obviously we need to look for alternative airline.",Detractor
"We flew Turkish Airlines from Tel Aviv to Frankfurt with a layover in Istanbul. First the service on the flight was terrible, I accidentally spilled hot coffee on my wife, the stewardess noticed it but couldnt care less (although it was burning hot, and my wife yelled), when I asked her for a napkin to clean the spilled coffee, she handed me 1 napkin without even asking if there is anything else she could do to help. That was only the beginning, due to late departure from Tel Aviv, we arrived late to Istnbul just to see our connecting flight push out of the gate (15 minutes earlier to take off time), we went to the Turkish Airlines desk, who told us we need to go to the transfer desk. When we got to the transfer desk, the clerk told us that we have been rebooked to a flight at 04:10, which meat that we had 9 hours wait. when I asked if they will give us a hotel room till the flight, we were informed that only if the delay is over 10 hours do they supply a hotel room. I asked to speak to a manager on duty to explain that the wait is 9 hours at night, we went to speak to a staff member but after letting us wait for 10 minutes he informed us that he is not a manager, and if we want to speak to one we need to go through immigration to the Turkish Airlines desk they will help us. We did so only to realize that there was nothing there. We needed to go back through immigration and went again to the desk to try to understand what we are expected to do in the 9 hours wait. The clerk informed us that we will be able to go to the Millennium lounge but only from 22:00 and until then we can get a complimentary meal from any restaurant in the terminal - which turned out to be false, only Burger king accepted the voucher for a lousy restricted basic meal. I can understand delays and re-booking, but I expect the airline will take responsibility for the delay and supply passengers a reasonable solution for their malfunction.",Detractor

Fantastic food and drink (eg. freshly squeased orange juice in Economy, perfectly cooked grilled fish, crispy skin, well balanced sauce), far better than any other airline I've travelled in economy. Good service with a smile. Seats are okay, similar to other airlines' economy. All flights on time and easy connection in Istanbul (short security queues, easier vs transfer in comparable airports like LHR, MAD, DXB).

Once in the air there was a transformation, with comfortable seating, excellent food. A really good experience on Istanbul to Bangkok sector. A lengthy delay on return, but this was not the fault of the airline, Turkish Airlines offer something special, but lack the refinement around the edges.

"Karachi to Istanbul to Chicago in February 2015: We took off on time. Istanbul Airport had snow and was shut, so re-routed to Ankara. Passengers from our flight were the first to arrive at the Ankara Transit Lounge and then came passengers from 7 other re-routed flights. Food was scarce. One sandwich and one cold drink in 10 hours. Snack store made money hand over fist. The worst part was that there were hardly any Turkish Airlines officials available to tell us that what the plan was. There were no public announcements about how long we will be there. People started to get angry not because they were stuck at the airport, they were angry because the Airline staff never bothered to tell us how long we will be stuck there. After about 10 hours of being in the transit lounge, they finally said we will be taken to a hotel for overnight stay. They said they will pay for the visa fee. We finally were herded to immigration and found out that we have to pay the visa fee and file for a reimbursement later. Some people had no $$s cash with them. Some people were very angry as $40 was a huge sum of money for them. After another two hours in the immigration line, we got our visas and were told that there are buses outside waiting to take us to hotel. Well, that was too good to be true. It took another 2.5 hours of standing in line in front of the terminal exit waiting for the buses to arrive/load. Finally we were got into a bus. On a positive note, the hotel was nice and dinner was free. At the hotel, one of the hotel staff told us that the passengers will have two choices in the morning: a 4 hour bus/train ride back to Istanbul airport. Once there, they will try to find a flight to get us out of the country, or possibly get us on a flight leaving from Ankara airport. I called United Airlines Global Services and they were able to get me a flight out of Ankara. I will not travel with Turkish again.",Detractor

"This was an older Turkish Airlines Boeing 777. Seat 1K in Business class, the footrest cushion had sagged in the middle. Very generous leg room but seat hardware and amenities are not up to date and not comparable to new generation of business class seats. Flat bed sleeping option worked (the crew made the bed) but the sit-up recline system was not working. Big video screen, but it IS so far from the seat that it was difficult to read small text. Crew courteous but lacked polish. Command of English WAS so so. Orders for first drinks were taken and then there was no drink service with the main meal. I eventually got some after making requests. Multiple food courses. Plating from the food trolley was done very professionally. Excellent food, probably the best in the industry. Good flavor and quantities. Fried eggs for breakfast - what a relief from airline omelettes! Clean toilet with fresh flowers and Turkish toiletries. Cumbersome to operate the entertainment system. Movie selection: mostly B+ grade movies, majority unknown titles. Overall a good product, amazing catering but they should upgrade the seat and more crew training.",Promoter
"The cabin temperatures were just right on my Turkish Airlines flights. VCE-IST was efficient, on time, gate agent fine. Second leg from Istanbul to San Francisco was a delayed departure. I looked around the Turkish Airlines lounge at Istanbul and it is as described, two floors, huge, lots going on, lots of food service. However, if flying Turkish Airlines you are going to get lots of food on the plane anyway so probably most helpful if you are using the lounge when flying nonbiz and have a pass/status. I personally prefer a smaller, quieter lounge but there's definitely the service here. Security for the connection to SFO from IST was heavier, including carry on search/testing and wanding everyone at the gate, so allow plenty of time at the gate. Lie flat seat was excellent, good bedding. I would never want the middle seat in business even with the good seat, and the Turkish Airlines Boeing 777 has middle seats in business class.

The food was excellent and the customer service was okay (I had to beg for a bottle of water when i was dehydrated from being in istanbul too long), but no matter how good the in-flight experience is, nothing defeats the purpose of an international flight more than getting there and finding your luggage didn't arrive with you. Why do we pay all that money for the ticket, for a promised service that is only half delivered. anyway, my lesson is it is better to spend more for an expensive airline that delivers in every way than risk your holiday experience on what in my opinion is a greedy enterprise.",Detractor
"It's not my first experience with Turkish Airlines, and to be honest about four years ago I was very happy with them. But my last trip was just unacceptable. I will not talk about service of the crew, it's well-known that they behave like you owe them something. To smile, to talk in a polite way or to offer some kind of assistance, it is not about them. The thing that made me upset that apart of that my luggage was opened, lock was broken, zipper and fabric cover were damaged. It happened during domestic flight from Antalya to Istanbul. Unfortunately, I've noticed that only when I arrived to Doha. I was very disappointed and I wrote a complain to Turkish Airlines. I was asking a simple explanation, but received only apologies, which they are using for all kind of complaints.",Detractor
"I flew Turkish Airlines from Dusseldorf to Bangkok, via Istanbul. Check in at Dusseldorf airport was delayed by 45 minutes due to Computer problems. There was then confusion over free luggage, the ticket said 20 kg, the staff said 30 kg. Check in staff claimed to be unable to check through luggage to Koh Samui (Thailand), but after lengthy discussion somebody gave okay. Due to delay from DUS, the connecting time in IST was only 30 minutes. Check in staff incompetent and unfriendly.",Detractor

"Flew Turkish Airlines from Manchester on A330 to Istanbul, the plane was a bit grubby with seat fabric stained. Seat legrest would not remain in raised position and lumbar support would not work correctly either. Flight departed on time at 11.15 and a meal was served almost immediately. It was very well presented and although quite simple was very tasty. What is the point of the chef? Cabins lights were dimmed and blinds closed immediately afterwards. No sign of cabin crew after that point. From Istanbul we flew to Ercan on a brand new A320, very nice except that the seat controls again did work properly, and because it was so new it needed both hands to extract the tray table from its location in the armrest. The meal again was well presented and quite acceptable. No chef on this flight and his absence was not really noticed. Boarding on both flights was a bit chaotic with a free for all at Istanbul.",Promoter
"Turkish Airlines is really a joke. I have tried for 4 days to get information about travelling with sports equipment. The hotline is not responding, the support at the Zurich Airport is not responding and the supposed Facebook support is not helping. You always get the same links to the site where any information can be found or the hotline which I have already contacted. Either they do not read questions or understand absolutely no English. My flights are now a 100â‚¬ more expensive and I still get no assistance about sports equipment. They simply do not answer me anymore. The worst support I've ever had.",Detractor
"Horrible service, will never fly Turkish Airlines again. I took a flight from Lyon to Taipei with a connecting flight in Istanbul. I was informed at check-in that my flight had been delayed 4 hours, upon further check at the airline's desk, I was informed that I had a choice to stay in Istanbul for 24 hours as there were no connecting flight due to the delay. The airline would provide lodging, transport to the hotel, and I only needed to apply for an evisa online. Up to this point the service had been slow but fine. This attitude had a 360 degree turn in Istanbul. As soon as I landed in Istanbul, a few passengers who would be staying at the provided hotel, myself included, tried to look for a way out of the airport and onto the shuttle bus. We were met with inefficient and unreasonable staff, my politeness was returned with unbelievably rude attitudes. We turned from counter to counter, with the staff giving us unhelpful directions. A counter lady near passport control informed another passenger that she needed a visa to get out of passport control. Frustrated of running at 3 in the morning with minimal sleep, I told her that I had a visa in which she continually urged that I needed a visa and finally, questioned my words when she asked with condescending demeanor whether I had the right visa. I took my visa through passport control where my documents and passport were thrown on the counter without response that I could leave. Still, I was lucky as I found out the next day, a few of the passengers had to stay at the airport (for more than 16 hours) because they had not been informed to apply for a visa in Lyon and after running around the airport once again trying to apply for a visa, was met with unhelpful staff and contradictory directions. Sadly, this was not the end of my nightmare. The insulting attitudes of the staff I had to bear when I asked for a certificate of delay at the airport before my flight was appalling. Again, I was turned from counter to counter (the staff seems not to have the ability to direct one to the right counter at first request) At my last stop I requested the certificate and explained my delay. Shockingly, the staff with scorn and disdain replied that my flight was not delayed, why or how did I believe it to be delayed? If it hadn't been delayed I would have been on my flight that second, not running madly around the airport struggling with airline staffsthat seems to despise and absurdly question the intellect of their customers. The breaking point came when he asked me why my flight had been delayed. No, the staff did not have the courtesy to tell me why my flight was delayed but had the audacity to put that question upon me. I have been very disappointed with Turkish Airlines on this horrendous trip. Through my encounters with the airline staff I felt insulted and laughed at. I question the credibility of an airline without efficiency, quality, and professionalism, to call itself one of the top airlines in the world.",Detractor
"I flew London to Ankara via Istanbul, and it is difficult to put into words how bad Turkish Airlines is. Their customer service desk at Istanbul seems designed to annoy as many people as possible in as shortest time as possible. We missed the connection because the first flight was delayed, and then I spent three hours in a line waiting to get a new flight. Despite having a business class ticket, I was turned away from the Business lounge and had to wait in the main terminal.

"I have never been treated so badly by customer service, once in Pisa and again in Istanbul. The agents did not inform me all the conditions related to my ticket and were laughing at my situation. They did not complete the transaction in time and I missed their deadline to check in, requiring me to purchase another full fare ticket. This happened twice. If something happens, Turkish Airlines make it as difficult as possible to help you and it appears they are only trying to mess you up. When traveling abroad, excellent customer service is a very important aspect of a company for a traveler.",Detractor
"The worst travel experience I had and I swear I will not fly Turkish Airlines again. I was traveling with my 9 year old daughter from Venice to Addis Ababa via Istanbul and there was a delay in our flight from Venice to Istanbul, which resulted in missing our connecting flight to Addis. This was not that surprising as I found out later it is very very likely to miss your connecting flight when you fly Turkish Airlines. Like everybody else, we went to the transfer desk and they put us on the next flight which is one day later. Next to the transfer desk there is a a place to make a free phone call to inform your family about the delay. This is where the trouble began, since there is a delay on almost every connecting flight they provide a single phone for all those people and there was a very long queue. We waited for about 2 hours on the queue and when there was only one person in front of me, this women came with one of the desk attendants and he let her to cut in front of me. I didn't think that was right and I complained and as he result he disconnect the telephone line and shut down everything, without caring even a bit about all those people on the line. The next step was to get a hotel to spend the night, which is located outside the airport and we need a visa to go out. The visa can be bought inside the airport but they refuse to accept our Ethiopian passport, and they demanded a resident permit from Italy. I had the permit card, with my daughters name included on the same card, it is the Italian immigration law that minors do not get independent permit card, but their name is included on one of the parents card. The Turkish police refused this and told me that I can get the visa but my daughter can't, which in my opinion a stupid police. When I try to get an explanation for such stupid rule, every one of them was giving me the same answer ""I don't know"". So we spent 24 hours inside the Istanbul airport, buying food with our own money. Even the people working at the food courts are very rude. The next day we boarded the aircraft on time but it took off 6 hours late, they even changed the entire cabin crew at one point. So we had a 30 hours delay in total. On our return flight we again missed our connecting flight but this time we waited only 3 hours for the next one. So you be the judge isn't Turkish Airlines the worst?",Detractor
"Paris to Cape Town via Istanbul with Turkish Airlines. New plane on both legs. Excellent entertainment system and good leg room. Check in easy at Paris and boarding done smoothly. Cabin crew on both flights very attentive, bottle of water for overnight flight and answered call bells quickly. Food passable. Main problem is at Istanbul airport. It is now very busy and can feel chaotic. For both flights there - landing and taking off - we were bussed to and from the airport. This meant a long trip to and from the plane. The gate for the bus to the plane has a small waiting area, no clear means of lining up and no priority given to any passengers at all whether they were elderly, had small children or were in business. More the problem of the airport rather than the airline.",Promoter
"I flew Turkish Airlines from Istanbul to Bucharest. While I was waiting for dinner to be served I laid flat the table for the cabin attendant to place the meal on it. I was sitting by the window and I fell asleep, for maximum two minutes. The passenger sitting in the aisle seat next to me received her dinner but the flight attendant passed by me without leaving my dinner. She didn't even try to gently wake me up. When I woke up the flight attendant was two seats in front of me. I pressed the call button for someone to come see me and I also called out to the flight attendant, but she ignored me completely, unwilling to turn her head and look at me. I couldn't get out from my seat as the woman next to me was eating and didn't want to disturb her. Nobody came to see me to ask me what was that I needed despite the fact that I previously turned on the button. I was completely ignored, and left without dinner.",Detractor
"I was flying Turkish Airlines from Istambul to Bodrum, a domestic flight within Turkey. Despite the fact I purchased business class tickets (not just for this route, but also to and from Turkey), when showing up at check in, they simply said they would downgrade me, because of overbooking. The way they handled the whole situation, kept us waiting for a long time both at check in, and also at boarding, the whole inconvenience was simply terrible experience. They offered a EUR50 check as compensation and thought this would be fair. After returning home, I wrote a complaint for the airline and their reaction is as scandalous as their operations: ""Concerning the matter you raised in your message, passengers not showing up for their flights cause flights to take place with empty seats. For this reason, as does every airline, Turkish Airlines, too, sells more tickets than the number of seats on the aircraft, from time to time. This situation is called overbooking, and in the case that all the passengers booked show up, some of our passengers unfortunately are unable to fly on the same flight."" Hence they think by explaining me as stupid kid, what overbooking means, they think downgrading is a fair action on their side and that was it. I am a frequent business traveller, this attitude and customer service is outrageous and luckily not everyday routine with other airlines. By the way, same thing happened to fellow travellers also on our way back Bodrum-Istambul-Budapest. Not just they downgraded them because of overbooking (seems to be pretty common with Turkish Airlines) but one of my friends ticket was also deleted from their system. Never heard of anything like this before. When she presented the printed version of her ticket (luckily she had it with her), Turkish Airlines said their system shows that because of overbooking, she was not only downgraded, but also transferred to another flight 1 day earlier than the actual flight. It also showed, that she actually took the flight the day before! This is madness. I have decided never to use Turkish Airlines.",Detractor
"Turkish Airlines flight from Gatwick was delayed with 30mins on the screen. We were all ready to depart, but they kept us waiting for another 1h 30mins without any explanation. I had that time for my connection so I started to feel that will lose it as I know how chaotic is Istanbul Ataturk airport (least passanger friendly). We just arrived 30mins before my departure to Bangkok, with another 25 passengers for the same flight to BKK. A guy was waiting for us at the entrance and guide us to our gate which was very helpful and made us think that we will actually catch the flight. We all arrived 10 mins before departure, but they close the gates and didn't let us on, the most annoying thing that without any explanation we could even see that they let PAX board before us. So dissapointing, staff does not speak English and not helpful at all. They guide us to the ""care desk"" with the grumpiest stuff ever (I understand that they need to deal with angry and dissappointed passangers all day, but they behaviour was unacceptable). I gave my boarding card to the lady in same time as my flight was departing.. She just printed me another ticket for the next flight 5 hours later. No appologies no nothing.

"We had a flight on Turkish Airlines from Moscow to Manila via Istanbul. Because our flight to Istanbul was delayed, we missed my second flight to Manila. After some time spent in queues we discovered the next flight to Manila will be two days after and staff of Turkish Airlines gave us the option to go to Manila next day via Bangkok. They told us that we should wait in the airport till they book our tickets. So, we waited for 3 hours without any service and during this time the staff couldn't do it. Only when we found manager he told us that we can go to hotel service and get our tickets tomorrow, and by that time it will be booked. It seems that staff from Turkish Airlines who told us we should wait our tickets didn't know about such option. Next day we got our boarding passes to Bangkok, and staff told us that we should get our tickets from Bangkok to Manila on Turkish Airlines transfer desk in Bangkok. They didn't tell us anything about second flight - no time, no airline. We asked about this flight from Bangkok to Manila two times - the guy on registration desk and the girl on supervisor desk. We also asked about our luggage and they told us that it will be sent to Manila with us. When we arrived to Bangkok, we didn't find any transfer desk of Turkish Airlines). It took a long time to found someone from Turkish Airlines with help of airport service, and at that time it turned out that flight, booked by Turkish Airlines for us, passed some time ago. After long investigation with girl from Bangkok office of Turkish Airlines they booked us tickets to Manila for the second time. I should say the Bangkok office of Turkish Airlines were the only ones who really tried to help us. When we finally reached Manila we found out our luggage haven't arrived yet and be in airport next day.

"The trouble started at SIN itself when our onward journey from IST to LIS was cancelled without notification. Upon inquiring at the airport, we were told that the cancellation was a mistake and that the sector would be reinstated. Once the reinstatement happened, we got our boarding passes. Looking at the trouble that we had, I asked the Turkish Airlines staff to reconfirm our return flight from IST to SIN and we were even allotted seats 16 A/B. The leg space in A330 is poor and I have never ever experienced such uncomfortable seats. The seating in Boeing 737 is more normal and I did not have any issues from IST to LIS. On our way back, IST airport was chaotic. People were not maintaining the queues and check-in was the most unruly I have encountered. Once we reached the counter we were informed that the flight is full. I told the agent that it is good for TK and I just want my boarding pass. I got the boarding pass after some reluctance on the agents part. I did not give it much importance but as soon as we moved from the counter, I saw STB on our seat allocation. I went back and inquired and was informed that we have been put on Standby. Even after informing the agent that I have confirmed seats, she said that she is unable to help me and that I would be helped at the gate. At the gate, the agents told us that a supervisor is going to come to help us out. However for the entire boarding time, no one came and only when we started to get agitated did someone come. There were approx 9 passengers who were on standby and the supervisor let 2 of them board. Then they allowed my wife to board and I was told that there is no more spare seat. I was angry and credit to the supervisor, he was professional and sent his assistant to physically check inside the aircraft and they found an empty seat which was allocated to me. Even though I boarded the flight that I was supposed to, I was earmarked for standby as the tag on my delayed luggage proved later. This was unacceptable.",Detractor

Planes were new and seats where like any European business class (i.e. economy seating with an empty middle seat) with the exception of the Istanbul - Amsterdam leg where it was a proper business cabin. Service was good and the food very good as usual. The lounge in Istanbul was great and I believe is truly exceptional by any airline standard. Turkish Airlines are also very competitive in price since their business class ticket was only a few dollars more than KLM or EL AL in economy. Transit in Istanbul was surprisingly smooth but i would recommend at least a 4 hour layover. It is obvious that the airline has outgrown it home base a long time ago and the airport can barely keep up with the volume of traffic going through. All four flights were delayed by at least 45 minutes to one hour which seems to be a standard now for TK flights.,Passive

However due to a change of aircraft, the airline chaged our seats and gave our son a window seat for sure but with two strangers either side od him.

Food was again tasty but quantity not enough. Overall I enjoyed Turkish Airlines. It was better than expected but not as good as Qatar Airways and Emirates and that's mostly because of the crew.

The A330-300 to DXB was such an aircraft. The problem was that this plane was not made for TK. There is an personal screen but films were only available in arabic (even not in Turkish) and only 3 options are presented and normally the IFE is very good on TK long haul flights.

The food is normally good, the lounge in Istanbul is excellent, but their service is deteriorating by the day. Old, dirty seats, no priority boarding, no access to lounges in smaller airports, finally they didn't load my special meal. When I complained through their online customer service system they were not apologetic, but on the contrary tried to justify and explain every fault.

I have flown with TK a number of times long haul from Asia and found this experience a complete let down. As mich as I've reviewed the good I'm also going to review the bad. Considering that they are competing with Etihad on this route it is very disappointing to see the aircraft quality. Business class seating was falling apart so badly that you could see the metal poles beneath it on some seats. Headrests too were so uncomfortable as well. The food and staff were fantastic on the flight and I can't fault this at all but the rest of it I don't have anything to complain about at all. The TK lounge in Istanbul is phenomenal as well. Flight departures on both sectors has actually been delayed in excess of an hour with everyone sitting onboard waiting in hot stuffy temperatures. At least on the IST-BEG flight there was an additional drink service but the poor people in Y didn't get this. TK really needs to lift their game if they intend to start flying to Australia because at this rate they won't have very many travellers if they aren't going to improve their product and make it more consistent.,Detractor

Food is the same old story, I now order either religious or a fruit platter, which is done with zero imagination and also and usually very boring. Return leg, good check in and fab fast lane and passport control direct in the entrance of the lounge. Boarding a mess, which is very common with TK on BRU route. This time was unforgettable, because of the remote door, no priority boarding, so no place for my bag in any compartment of Business class. Some pax delayed boarding for 45 minutes. My request for a platter was not there either. I complained. Very good, young and friendly purser and c class cabin attendant was eager to help, which made it nicer. Will fly them again in fact in two weeks.",Passive

Inflight entertainment system of seat no 28F remained non-operational for a good hour. Inflight entertainment system of seat 28D became non-operational after approximately one hour of operation.

"Our return leg back to Abuja from Heathrow was terrible. Me and my wife were issued just the boarding pass to Istanbul from Heathrow, while my son (2.5 years old) got boarding pass to Istanbul from Heathrow and Istanbul to Abuja. When I complained they said don't worry, jut pick it up when you get to Istanbul. We arrived Istanbul and someone from Turkish Airlines was announcing to us that passengers transiting to Abuja should go to the boarding gate immediately - we complained that we were not given boarding pass in Heathrow and the guy said go upstairs. We got upstairs at the Turkish Airlines desk told them we need boarding pass. After waiting for about 2 mins, I noticed the lady had a strange look on her face, unfortunately they don't speak good English, so off she went came back after about 2 minutes with someone who flatly told us, sorry you cannot board that plane. I asked him why, he said the plane has departed. He said the option we have is to either spend 48 hours in a Hotel in Istanbul, they'll take care of our hotel bills and food or we go via Egyptair that has a 6 hours wait in Istanbul, 8 hours wait in Cairo and a total of about 8 hours flight. We spent 6 hours wait time on a cold metal chair in Istanbul and 8 hours in Cairo. After a combined 8 hours flight from Istanbul to Abuja via Cairo, we finally arrived Abuja. We got to Abuja but all my checked in luggage could not be found. 5 days after arriving Abuja Turkish airline is telling me its the responsibility of Egyptair to find my luggage not theirs.

"I flew with Turkish Airlines many times inside Europe and received great service, flights, cabin crew, food. I decided to fly with them on long flight to Kuala Lumpur. Flight and service Budapest-Istanbul was like it should be. Istanbul to Kuala Lumpur and back the A330-300 has small space for legs (Boeing is better), they served food 2hrs after departure at 3AM, no smile on crew faces, slow service.

"Turkish Airlines night flight from Heathrow through Ataturk on my way to Bulgaria. Arriving in Ataturk around 4 AM, I waited for the gate indication for the 7:30 flight to Bulgaria. Around 5:30am, it opened, so I went to the gate and showed the pair of Turkish Airlines employees my boarding pass and sat down right in the front row of the departure lounge. Exhaustion took over and I slumped in my chair, jerking awake to see the bus leaving for the plane and the big red letters CLOSED. I jumped to the desk and asked the man why he did not call me or wake me up, when he knew I was on that flight. He simply smirked and said â€œNot my responsibilityâ€. I asked him what I should do, but he was determined to brush me off, simply saying â€œtry going upstairs to the transfer desk.â€ Well, that set off a chain of absurdity the likes of which I've never seen in my life. It seemed that every employee, either of Ataturk Airport or of Turkish Airlines, ranged from nonchalant to downright belligerent. I was sent on a wild goose chase from desk to desk to desk, with practically everyone having the â€œnot my responsibilityâ€ attitude. There was no solution at the â€œtransfer deskâ€, and they kept sending me to other desks in what began to feel like some kind of absurd hazing ritual. Finally, after running the gauntlet several times, I was informed that I would have to clear immigration to get to the Turkish Airlines sales desk in the airport. Supposedly that was the only path to a solution for my problem. I stood in line for over an hour to get stamped, but was told â€œYou need a Turkish visa.â€ Incredulous, on my way to the visa desk, I asked the same information clerk why he didn't tell me that I needed a visa, and he (I am not making this up) told me â€œYou didn't ask. It's not my responsibility to think for you.â€ At this point, I was choking back tears. I just couldn't believe it. I got back into line after paying 20 pounds for a visa and about an hour later finally got to the Turkish Airlines sales desk. The clerk informed me that it was â€œnot Turkish Airlines' problemâ€ that I was not notified of the boarding and that I would have to pay an additional 265 euros in order to be able to board the next available flight, which was twelve hours later. I thought that was extremely unfair, given that I was at the gate on time and had identified myself to the ground staff. I thought I had the right to be informed of the flight leaving and woken up. Nothing I said to them was received with any amount of comprehension, compassion, or understanding. They said that if I didn't like their solution, I could go to their â€œsupervisor's deskâ€ at counter B15. At counter B15, I waited and waited until I finally got to talk to the extremely annoyed agent, who curtly informed me that she was â€œnot authorizedâ€ to handle my request, and that I was welcome to call customer service at the help phone. The lady on the help phone was the most helpful out of anyone I had spoken to in a now 5-hour drama, but even she was only able to â€œmake a reportâ€. Long story short, I was forced to pay 178 euros to board the next flight, and when I got to Sofia that night, I saw that Turkish Airlines lost my luggage on top of everything. Three days later, I was informed that Turkish Airlines will not deliver my lost luggage, so I am forced to pay another 100 euros in taxis to get to the airport in Sofia to retrieve my things.",Detractor
"Both flights were okay and went smoothly, although I never thought my flight experience could be so greatly affected just by customer support! When we arrived in Istanbul (at almost midnight) we were informed that the airline would not be providing overnight accommodation (our next flight left about 13:40 the next day) because there was another flight coming from Rome in the morning - meaning it would have been possible for us to take that flight and not have as long of a layover. Not only did Turkish Airlines not tell us this until we arrived in Istanbul, they basically yelled this at us and then the agent walked away from the desk - worst customer service experience ever. Had we known this, I would have had no problem making hotel plans for that night prior to arriving of course but after experiencing this bad service we were then left to find a hotel for the night in a city we had never been to. It's a shame because the flight crew worked very hard at their jobs but our experience was ruined by poor service from the hotel desk.",Detractor
"Two flights to get us from Ankara to Athens. The first leg was to Istanbul. Online check-in worked and very fast service at Ankara airport. Boarding started 50 minutes before flight due to go which seemed early. Flight was supposed to be 45 minutes, revised to 52, and eventually took 80 as we went past Istanbul and then turned back. This left us with tight connection at AtatÃ¼rk. However we left half an hour late for no apparent reason. So overall too much time on the planes for such a short journey. Onboard service excellent though. In flight entertainment not turned on for first flight, but was for second.",Passive
"We first went to Istanbul in a 4hr flight from Malaga. We had lunch, which was good. Then a Boeing 777 to Tokyo, they took care of the ambience so we didn't have so much jet lag, food came twice, and drinks were served several times. I recommend the home-made lemonade. When going to Tokyo we also enjoyed a typical Turkish cake in the two flights, but when coming back to Malaga we didn't. When coming back to Instanbul, we were next to the catering area, where dishes were prepared. The cabin crew made some noise, so sleeping was a harder thing. I guess the best thing about the food in general is the variety of small things you have when you eat, and the worst thing is the fact that Turkish really don't make a difference between breakfast and lunch/dinner. For example, when going from Narita to Istanbul we had food twice, but before landing at 4 am, I guess it's better to have some small breakfast rather than dinner, remembering we had dinner-like food before on that flight. I really missed the Turkish pistachios when returning. The last thing to mention was the last cabin crew group, when going from Istanbul to Malaga, looked old, like the parents of those who took us to Istanbul in the 777. I would have liked to be able to buy some Turkish Airlines merchandising on-board. Overall, we have to remember the good prices. Turkish will continue being a good airline whenever they continue with that more or less good relation between quality and money.",Promoter

They offered a flight from Rome, but later learnt that it was full. We turned back to Florence. Two days later we went to Pisa Airport -very small - We checked in normally.

I have flown with Turkish Air on previous occasions and found them very good. However this experience was well below their usual good record. Firstly I have to comment on the Turkish Airlines business lounge at Istanbul which would have to be the best lounge anywhere. But unfortunately it's a rose amongst the thorns as the rest of this airport is just awful and unfriendly. Our problems started at boarding where there was no priority whatsoever - in fact we were the last to board. Then the seats in the Boeing 737 are the same as you would expect on a 1 hour flight - very difficult to sleep sitting up. And the chef was missing which is a point of difference for this airline. This was an 11 hour overnight flight so they really need to upgrade the business product. We mysteriously had a 1 hour stopover at some Russian airport on the way that I was not expecting and was not able to use the business lounge there (small as it was). Lastly out bags came out without any priority. So I was really wondering why I paid 3 times the economy ticket price. I have previously been a strong supporter of Turkish Airlines but they let me down badly on this route. I would still recommend them if the plane has lay flat seats in business.,Passive
"I had travelled on 16th July from Munich to Dubai via Istanbul with my family. Our flight from Munich was delayed over an hour. Turkish Airlines staff didn't make much effort to hurry up the process. After landing at Istanbul, we ran across from one side of the airport to the other side in an effort to catch our connecting flight to Dubai. But by the time we reached the gate about 15 minutes before the scheduled departure the gate was closed and none of airline staff could be seen though they should have known that flights from Munich was delayed. There was absolutely no effort to accomodate the extra few minutes for delay in connecting flights. Next when we contacted Turkish Airlines staff about our next connecting flights, one staff member took our boarding passes for Dubai and disappeared for an hour leaving us at the desk. We tried to find out about our next flight status and other staff members were unwilling to answer us leaving us totally bewildered. Finally after waiting over an hour, our new boarding passes were issued. Finally when we landed at Dubai, our baggage were misplaced though we had specifically asked our baggage so to be transferred to new flight. Finally we heard that the baggage was never transferred to the new flights. Today we heard that our baggage had finally arrived at the airport and we were still waiting for our bags.",Detractor
"I am a wheelchair user and traveled alone this time. Turkish Airlines staff made a problem why I travel alone, remarking ""I am not supposed to travel alone"", ask me to sign a document which says they are not responsible for any damage or injury if I would enter the plane. No other passenger was asked to sign this document. Also, after disconnecting the joystick of my power wheelchair, they did not allowed me to take the joystick with me, but put it in a plastic bag and wanted to leave it like that in the cargo part. After I disagreed, because it can be easily damaged, Turkish Airlines staff said to me that the company would rather pay for the joystick than something to happen to the plane because of the joystick. The joystick itself, when disconnected from the batteries has no any power, our laptops and phones can make more problem than disconnected joystick. I have been traveling with Turkish Airlines for couple of times and what always happens is that I am informed as a wheelchair user that I am not able to use the toilet during the flight, because Turkish Airlines does not have cabin chair during the flight, nor they would assist to push the chair to the toilet (which is service other companies offer). The longest flight with Turkish Airlines, in which I was not able to use the toilet was flying from Istanbul to Cape Town, with two hours stop in Johannesburg, so for 15 hours I was not able to use toilet. For passengers without disability, Turkish Airlines may be a good choice, because of their good connections all around the world, but for me as a wheelchair user is a headache. Because of the legislation, when Turkish Airlines is flying in USA, they do have different policy for people with disabilities because in USA you can not discriminate someone because of disability.",Detractor

I couldn't arrive at the airport until 50 minutes before the flight. Even though the check-in counter closes an hour before the scheduled departure, I was able to hand in my luggage (I'd checked-in online). Pushback was at 21.10, and no explanations were made about the delay. At the beginning of the flight, Turkish delight was served. At dinner, either meatballs or chicken could be selected. I chose the meatballs, and it was delicious, and extremely hot for an airline food. I was able to listen the newest Euro Hits by using the in-flight radio.

Legroom was more than expected for an economy class seat. Food was almost as good as what you'd expect at a restaurant. Hot/cold beverages were served throughout the flight. As a means of in-flight entertainment, there was nothing but in-flight music. Not-so-high quality earphones were distributed at the beginning of the flight, and the system lacked variety. Various films/series were played on the on-board screens, I wish it could be possible to see the location/speed/altitude of the plane. Announcements made by the pilot/first officer in English were fairly incomprehensible. To conclude, by paying the same money, I flew with a premium airline instead of a low-cost airline.

"In reading through other reviews, I can see that my experience unfortunately is not unique. Customer service is lacking. This summer we took 8 flights with Turkish Airlines â€“ starting in LA and going to Istanbul, then traveling around the country also with Turkish Airlines, roundtrip to Denmark - and then back to LA. Quite a lot of time, money and interactions with the airline in June and July 2015. The initial trip was good, and we enjoyed the entertainment that helps make the 13 hours bearable. The food was not great. My request for vegetarian food was only honored on the trip to Istanbul. Lost luggage, rude interactions with Turkish Airlines staff at the check-in counter and onboard, zero accountability and initiative. Our luggage was lost 2 times during the 8 trips â€“ first with a connecting flight from Istanbul to Izmir. The plane was delayed from Kayseri so it wasn't a big surprise â€“ despite the fact the agent at the gate ensured us it was on the plane when we boarded. After1.5 hours the luggage appeared. And we got to our destination at 1 am in the morning. The second time â€“ on a direct flight from Copenhagen to Istanbul â€“ one suitcase was lost, remained lost for about 2-3 hours with no explanation â€“ and very little care from the staff at the lost and found office. After continued pressure they suddenly produced the suitcase, and we could get to our hotel. No explanation, no apology no care whatsoever. The following day we left for Los Angeles on our final trip back. We inquired, when checking in, if there was anything they could do to make our trip back a bit more comfortable due to the issues and time wasted earlier. In total we talked to six different staff members â€“ first to a supervisor in the check in area â€“ who said â€œnoâ€ and that was that. At the care Point â€“ the staff couldn't care less, the moment they were confronted with a problem, an unhappy customer, it appeared their command of the English language was lost, they gave us a blank stare and pointed to the gate. At the gate, we had the most unprofessional and rude encounter and staff said no. I was left with the impression that, no one cares, no one feels responsible and accountable, there's an acute lack of training and proficiency in the most basic part of customer care. If Turkish Airlines wants to deliver on the brand promise â€“ Europe's Best Airline, they need to embrace a better approach to service â€“ caring goes a long way when you are traveling, a smile, empathy and helpful interactions would have made a world of difference.",Detractor

After delay of about half an hour and while the passengers on this full 737-800 were standing for a long time at the new gate, only one staff was taking care of boarding which took a long time and a lot of agony on behalf of passengers to complete. The aircraft was a â€œnew interiorâ€ Boeing 737-800. Again, only one flight attendant was serving the first 12 or so rows which clearly is more than what they usually suppose to handle.

"While the inflight service and comfort level of the seats were mediocre at best, my feedback deals with the service by the airline staff at the gate. My elderly parents were booked on a flight from Izmir to Houston via Istanbul and were to meet me in Istanbul for the Istanbul to Houston leg. The airline only gave 45 minutes between the Izmir flight and Istanbul-Houston flight. I assumed this meant that there would be no extra passport checks (since that was all done in Izmir) and that there would be gate attendants to direct the passengers trying to make the connection to the proper gate to expedite the process. That was not the case. The plane from Izmir was stood on the tarmac for 25 minutes so they had far less than 45 minutes to get to the Istanbul to Houston flight, which was already boarding at the time and there was no guidance at all. When I inquired as to whether the flight from Izmir had arrived at the Istanbul-Houston gate and when I explained the situation, the staff ignored me and told me to step out of the way. They told me my parents had 5 minutes to get there and that if they didn't the plane would leave without them. They also stated that there was nothing they would do. They would not announce their names and began to laugh at me and speak about me in Turkish in a mocking way. In short, not only were they were neither helpful nor sympathetic, but they were rude. Other passengers boarding the flight noticed this and expressed their displeasure, this was even echoed by some of the security staff of the airport. My parents finally made it. I wanted to like Turkish Airlines, however my trip made it quite plain that this airline is only a premiere airline for those in Business and First class. It is only a premiere airline if you don't ask any questions and only speak when spoken to. Very disappointing.",Detractor

Flew Colombo-Istanbul via Male to Antalya three weeks ago and got back last Monday. All flights were delayed except for the last leg on return flight from Istanbul to Colombo via Male where I really would have prayed for a delay as my connecting flight got 1.30 hrs delayed from Antalya! Good in-flight service and food etc. Flight delays are so common that you spend an addition of 5-6 hrs on the way than originally scheduled! Plus mad rushing from Domestic to International Terminal in Istanbul with only about 20 minutes for the connecting flight. One of my bags came on the flight. Other came one day. Can't recommend this airline unless you can stomach constant delays!,Detractor
"Flew into Delhi from IST. Business Class. Flight: TK 716 on 5th June 2015. By Far my worst experience in business class. (Despite having flown United several times). On a 6 Hour Flight: Business Class Passengers get blankets and Pillows from the regional Economy Class cabin. Rude Staff horrible service wouldn't even give hot/cold towels before or after meal. Ordered Asian Vegetarian Meal 1 month in advance got it onboard. Nearly Inedible. My mother returned her food we requested for the other vegetarian options from the menu we are told that there qwew none left. 1 hour later I walk in on the staff eating the remaining Indian Vegetarian food. After touchdown did not even give the standard ""Ladies and Gentleman we have arrived at XXX airport or welcome to XXX Airport or the weather report just went on and on about the seatbelts"". Did not even greet passengers during deplaning. Since I flew on the same Airline from the US I have reasonable backing to conclude that these people do not like to cater to passengers on this route or to people belonging from this destination. Horrible Staff.",Detractor
"TK 80 SFO to IST in business class. Best transatlantic business class product out there. Its food and service can give any European carrier's First class a run for their money. So much food and drink. Then there are airlines which don't serve even a meal when travelling First Class on a 5 hour flight because its ""domestic"" (eg United). They kept serving us food for the first 3 hours of the 12 hour flight. Entertainment system: Latest one not even shared publicly on the airline website. Touch screen remote which itself has a large interactive LCD screen/player works independent to the main screen! Movie choices: Amazing! Audio albums: Biggest collection I've seen. Seat is a bit narrow however very comfortable to sleep in. Amenity kits were from Cerruti. Although arrival in Istanbul was disappointing due to delayed baggage delivery. The only unfortunate thing is this is their best product and will probably not be used in Asia ever because Turkish heavily favours US destinations over others. eg. On their Delhi Flight they give out thin blankets in business from regional economy class flights. Hopefully this will change.",Promoter

LHR-SFO (return) via IST. Check-in at LHR was fast en efficient and the PrimeClass lounge was nice with a good food selection. Boarding at LHR was a bit chaotic but we got on board. First leg (LHR-IST) was a A321 with large seats in BC very comfortable for the short trip food was ok and the aircrew were friendly. IFE was an older system with 4 movie running on a loop no great but for a three hour flight it was acceptable. IST airport is very overcrowded and even the BC lounge was packed so I decided to get some sleep at the airport hotel. A little pricey but well worth it. Boarding at IST was without any BC priority boarding and extra document and security check before being bussed to the plane. While airports like the old Doha airport had this down to an art IST seems to have turned this in to organised chaos not a nice experience at all. Second leg was a B777 with a 2-3-2 configuration. I had problems seeing how this would work prior to flying by I saw both a single mum with two children and two parents with a child for whom this setup with 3 seats in the middle worked a charm. Flight crew were nice and service minded but very slow to bring food out and the chefs costume is a terrible gimmick they should drop sooner rather than later as unlike Gulf Airlines where you can discuss the meal with an actual chef and make changes to the menu at Turkish they simply take an order from the menu and that is it. Food was good and plentiful. The seat was ok for sitting and eating or lying down but getting a comfortable position to relax in the middle was very hard and took some fiddling with the limited controls. IFE offered true AVOD with a large selection of films and TV shows as well as live TV. Films were not all the latest and greatest but I think there was something for everyone. Return journey started out better than at LHR with quick and efficient check-in at SFO and boarding done in a controlled and orderly fashion. I had a quick look in the United Club lounge with was nice and quiet but had a very limited selection of food. Plane was again a B777 with a good and attentive flight crew although they seemed a bit more robotic than the previous crews. Food was excellent and plentiful although again it seemed to take quite a while to get it served. Short transit in IST where boarding descended in to a new level of chaos with absolutely no announcements no BC priority boarding and extra document checks. As a seasoned flyer I knew to just get in a queue and get on with it but a rookie flyer would have been lost in the chaos. Not good enough and this needs to be changed fairly sharpish. Again a A321 this time with a refurbished cabin which meant the IFE was true AVOD (the same system as on the B777) and nice new seats. Again a pleasant flight crew that spent forever getting food served. The food was good but we got in to LHR about 20 minutes late because we were 30 minutes late out of IST. Price considered the offering is very good as long as you accept that IST airport is old over capacity and chaotic beyond belief.,Promoter
TK 1994 / 1995 16th - 23rd May 2015. My wife and I recently flew to Istanbul with Turkish Airlines. I have to say that the whole experience from booking the flight to landing back in the UK was excellent.

Jakarta to Istanbul with a stopover at Singapore Changi. Check in was smooth even though Turkish didn't have a fixed check in counter in CGK. Boarding was fast and smooth. On CGK-SIN flight sandwich was served a good one with a selection of drinks. Then we have to leave the plane and reboard again one hour later at Changi. The SIN- IST leg was great the crew served properly but it lacked eye contact. They were chatting with fellow crew members while they were serving passengers. The catering service was good and the amenity case was a good looking tin pencil case which was a nice touch. The IFE was decent with a broad choice of movies and music. The return trip was in the same quality except a fair 45-60 minutes delay because of congestion at Istanbul Ataturk. My conclusion Turkish is a great choice for a long haul flight.,Promoter
IAD-IST-BLQ and return. The plane was clean and with adequate seat pitch. Plane left Washington with only a very minor delay. Turkish delight passed out and later a hot towel service. No cocktail service. Dinner at 1.40am and it was the best airline meal I have had accompanied with great Turkish wine. I asked for and was given a refill on the wine. After coffee service and trays cleared crew came around with another drink service. Bright lights finally dimmed after 3am when it was already light outside. Global positioning system not working on this flight at least not displayed. Entertainment systems not working too well only limited number of selection. Crew passed out amenity kits normally not seen in economy. Children had their own amenity kit and a stuffed bear. After dinner a bottle of water passed out to all passengers additional water available in galley as well as snacks. Crew were friendly,Promoter

ZRH-IST-KIX and return. Plane from ZÃ¼rich to Istanbul was 4.5 hrs late missed the night flight to Osaka took the next flight 24 hrs later and the suitcase took an additional 24 hrs detour. The transportation to the hotel in Istanbul due to the flight missed was organized however the hotel was a 40 min ride across the Bosporus arriving at 4am in the morning. Okay the in-flight service was okay but would I fly TK again? Not if I can avoid it because there was no information during all these delays my online feedback afterwards produced only prefabricated and unrelated standard answers and more importantly minor delays can produce quickly a 24 hrs. delay if there is only 1 flight per 24 hrs (true not only from long distance trips!).,Detractor

Flew from JFK to Istanbul with transfer to Bologna 4/23. Flight delayed 1.5 hrs - no big deal happens. Seat cramped personal entertainment system broken. Food and drink better than average - I'll give them that. Istanbul airport is a crowded mess and the info monitors are not very informative. About 30 min before the scheduled boarding time they flash the message that our flight from Istanbul to Bologna was canceled along with > 40 other flights. No overhead announcement no airport workers in sight can explain coherently what to do or don't speak English. We later learn that a plane caught fire on landing and the runway was closed because of that. After about 6 hrs of running from one place to another and dealing with incompetent and rude employees we were fed and placed in a hotel. We were rebooked for the flight next morning but our luggage was not on it and took 3 more days for it to arrive in Italy.,Detractor
Hong Kong to Istanbul in Business on the latest TK 777-300ER with the brand new business and economy seats. There is no more Comfort (Premium Economy) on this aircraft.

Flight 71 Hong Kong to Istanbul Business class layout of 2-3-2 in a 777-300ER. This flight leaves at 11.25pm. We flew Qantas up to HK and had a 6 hour wait in HK. The first 3 hours of the flight is an eating delight. There were 2 fully decked out chefs on-board in Business class. The food presentation was just amazing. The food itself was very tasty and it just keep coming. Nothing was too much trouble. The table layout was like dining in a top restaurant and it even had an electronic candle that flickered. Breakfast was an equally excellent experience of service and taste. The seats are very roomy and quite comfortable for that long 11 hour flight and go fully flat. Ok the not so good. And it their lounge in HK. Its not their own lounge and its a shared arrangement. Its very down market and not very well appointed. To have a shower you had to book in and the next available time was 11.45pm 20 min after my flight was to leave. They really need to improve their lounge access to compete with the others as their inflight experience is excellent.,Promoter

On our short (3-hour) flight we were served a full meal (they even hand out menu cards beforehand!). That alone impressed me but then when I saw how nicely it was arranged/presented and how good it tasted I was blown away. I don't think I've ever 'cleared my plate' on with any previous airline meal but that happened on both flights (to and from Istanbul). There was a pillow and headphones on each seat and the in-flight movie selection was incredible - my only complaint is that there were too many movies to choose from. Very satisfied and impressed with my first experience with this airline. Would absolutely recommend it to others and would definitely fly Turkish Airlines again.,Promoter

I flew to Osaka which was a 2-legged flight with a transit at Turkey International Airport. I was fortunate enough to get good seats thanks to the staff at the check-in counter as she was very helpful and accommodating.

I flew in Economy from JFK to Ankara via Istanbul on April 24 2015 and returned on May 2. My overall experience was very positive: Turkish provides superb meals on transatlantic flights and even managed a satisfying mini-meal on the short Istanbul-Ankara flight. Cabin staff were abundant friendly and present on all four flights. Ticket counter and gate personnel had a somewhat severe affect but were nonetheless very helpful. Turkish B777's are fairly new (the oldest is less than 5 years old) clean and offer very good inflight entertainment. Lavatories seemed clean throughout the flight. Economy seating is quite cramped on Turkish B777's however but not to the point of discomfort. Ataturk Airport in Istanbul is better approached as an adventure rather than as a convenience: it is prone to delays chaotic lines and overheated spaces. Allow at least 2.5 hours to transfer between international and domestic flights there.,Promoter
SFO-IST-ADB/BJV-IST-SFO. I have not often flown TK in economy but was part of a group and that was where we sat. I was astounded by the perks that TK offers in Y. There were pillows blankets headsets and slippers at each seat. A small amenities kit was provided as well as hot towels prior to the first meal. There was also a printed menu with a choice of entrees. The legroom is a bit tight but the seat has an adjustable lumbar support and a footrest that help in adjusting position. The food was plentiful and well prepared and there was a full drinks service available. While I would have preferred to be in Business TK economy is heads above any of its competitors. The crew was friendly and attentive which also made the experience enjoyable.,Promoter
We flew from SFO-IST on April 17. The flight arrived late and so left SFO about 2 hours late making us miss our connection to Athens. Turkish put us up in a hotel provided meal voucher and transportation. They also booked us on the first TK flight to Athens the next day even though our IST-ATH-IST ticket was validated on Aegean Airlines. I will say that customer service/communication is not their strongest point but the service on the flight between SFO and IST was excellent. The food was delicious and sandwiches and snacks provided throughout the flight. The attendants were helpful and courteous and very pleasant. I would fly them again because though they have their shortcomings they are certainly tops in inflight service.,Passive

"TK 333 Baku to Istanbul. Six hours delayed without any explanation. Once it finally boarded and took off the crew never acknowledged the delay in any way just wished us a nice flight! Toward the end of the flight they announced gates for those who had not missed their connections. Never acknowledged that some of us had gave no instructions whatsoever. When I found a service desk the guy printed out my new boarding pass (for a flight the next morning) and threw it at me only when I asked did he blurt out something about going through passport control then to the hotel desk. By then it was late at night three PP control guys serving a huge crowd people starting to get angry and shout. I was afraid I would get through PP control then not get any help and be stuck outside the airport so instead I headed for the wonderful Turkish Airlines VIP lounge. There they refused to give me one of the sleeping rooms but did offer a ""five star hotel"" and a shuttle if I left the airport. By then it was so late that I would barely have time to get to the hotel before it would be time to return to the airport for my early flight so I hung out in the lounge all night. In all this time there was never the slightest apology for the delay or even a smile. I travel a great deal and am usually fine with different personal styles (and I love Turkey!) but this was over the top for lousy customer service.",Detractor

Done 4 flight segments in 3 weeks DMM-IST IST-FCO BCN-IST and IST-DMM. Check-in was organized and was swift given because there were not much pax on all flights problem started on the boarding it was chaotic where everyone just ran to board the plane and ground cannot enforce boarding rules like who should go first etc. There wasn't much enforcement of carry on luggage as well as most passengers bring huge bags sometimes 2-3 pieces inside the cabin and some passenger didn't have any space for their luggage to place. Flight was delayed on all flights either due to late arrival of the aircraft or the cabin needs to cleaned before passenger can board or there is no gate assigned yet. which should have been pretty standard in most airlines. Once onboard the service was a hit and miss some cabin crew were rude and with poor command of English and while some maybe 1 or 2 are eager to please cabin is as usual clean but the toilets gets filthy half through the flight. The seats are very narrow and uncomfortable I'm an average 5'8'' in height and was having difficulty moving this onboard their A321 and Boeing 737. IFE was average not much new movies and quite unresponsive the touchscreens you'll still have to use the remote. Information from the cockpit came only twice before take off and before landing. Food - their lunch and dinner are good above average servings are large plus Turkish delight is distributed prior to take off. Drinks were served frequently which was good amenity kits were given which was a plus! Landing was smooth and a plus was even with a tight connection my bags reached the destination.,Passive
"We flew LGW-IST-CMB on 16/4 and being a frequent flyer and Star Alliance Gold member I can easily say that this was the worst flying experience of my life. I have never met so rude uninterested and unhelpful staff on any other airline before. To start with I was denied access to a lounge at LGW. I am aware that Star Alliance do not have a lounge there but all other airlines I have used before have given me access to contracted lounges. TK did not. First flight as relatively OK on their new B737 but seats were very uncomfortable. Then we arrived in IST and the problems started. When I went to the lounge and connected my phone to the wifi I found an email from them saying ""your flight to {1} is delayed please contact {2}"". I went to the lounge reception and showed them the email and they told me it's nothing to worry about. When I looked on their website though I saw that the IST-CMB flight was delayed by 5 hours. From then it took us about 3 hours in order to sort out a hotel. When the flight departed the next morning there was no mention at all by anyone as to why the flight was delayed or a single apology. 10 hours on that plane and nothing. The crew were the most unprofessional and rude cabin crew. Not interested in passenger satisfaction and not interested in safety. Their English was very poor.

"Flew to London Heathrow from Hurghada via Istanbul. Everything started off fine. Punctual and a comfortable business class seat on what appeared to be a brand new 737-800. The problems then began with the plane landing in the ""wrong"" Istanbul airport. One very brief announcement from the Captain about weather and that is where the information stopped. No one on board was able to give us any information about missed connecting flights whilst we waited on the tarmac. Plane was full of connecting passengers. Plane then takes off to the correct airport. On arrival there was nobody from Turkish Airlines to process or inform customers of what to do. Eventually we found the transfer desk which had a minimum of 250 people descending on only 4 very harassed and extremely impolite ticket agents. When I finally got to the front the ticket desk agent simply stood up and walked away announcing that it was the end of his shift. Got a new pass for a plane leaving 5 hours later. Still no apology. Just thrown at me as if I should be grateful. Found the business class lounge that was also stuffed to the gunnels at the entry reception and barely a seat available in the place. Summoned to the new gate at far end of the airport. It was a full Airbus 330-300. There was a double security check leading to a seated area that was the size for a small commuter jet flight. 280 or so Passengers were rammed into each other waiting for the coach. There was no Business class fast track. On board staff were the most unfriendly bunch and seemed to have a collapse in their understanding of basic English. One seemed to really struggle with the concept of ""Could I have my lunch a bit later?"" Suffice to say my meal was served with no menu. I was then told that it was either Chicken or Pasta. They forgot to offer me the dessert and I had to chase them for it and was told ""We will see if we have anything left."" Even on disembarkation at the plane of the door they pointedly refused to say goodbye. The main hub is a complete mess and deeply unpleasant experience and the staff on board are feckless and rude. I would put this Business class experience down as the worst premium flight of my life. I fly on average 100 times per year nearly always in premium cabins. so that is saying something. Only saving grace were the seats themselves. Which have to be said on both flights were comfortable.",Detractor

PRG-IST and IST-PRG. My first flight with Turkish Airlines and quite a disappointment. We were about one hour late on both flights - as the air conditioning was not on it was awfully hot on the plane but no water was offered. The seats were not very comfortable and there was very little space. The flight attendants did not seem very interested in what people were doing (like playing with their mobiles and reclining the backs of their seats during the take-off). On the return flight there was a family with an infant squealing like an air raid siren sitting two rows away from me which turned the whole flight into a torture exercise. To finish on a positive note - food was very good and I appreciated having my own screen with flight information. Yet in future I will try to avoid Turkish Airlines and it is a mystery for me how they can score so well in the ratings.,Detractor
OSL-IST-AGP return February/March 2015. OSL-IST on B738 aircraft. Flight more than 80% full. Cramped seating in economy. I moved to a row of 3 vacant seats were I could sleep after the meal service. The same applies for the AGP-IST sector on B738 aircraft. IST-AGP on A321-200. The aircraft seemed brand new. The flight was almost 100% full. My seat was in an emergency exit row and so the legroom was very good. The same applies for the IST-OSL sector A321-200 aircraft and seated in an emergency exit row. I had the option to travel for a slightly lower fare non-stop with Norwegian (from Gardermoen airport) or Ryanair (from another Oslo airport not Gardermoen) but I had to be at Malaga at a determined time of the day and when you factor in the luggage Turkish Airlines was then the most reasonable option.

TK 1956 AMS-IST old aircraft and the so called Business Class an outdated most uncomfortable 'joke' with zero comfort. TK 0673 IST-MBA the 757 single aisle aircraft is not suitable for long haul flights and the C-Class seats compared to other airlines like KQ or KL which I frequently use on this route of poor standard and lacking comfort. Service run of the mill food mediocre and run out of choice with selection of 25ml bottled wine - very poor.,Detractor
LHR-IST return. As a frequent business class passenger who has already tried British Airways Lufthansa KLM Etihad Emirates I can only say that this was definitely the worst of them all. Old and run-down seats with parts of the seat torn down and dirty. First part of the trip with newer 777 and angled lie flat but return a recliner like on a premium economy. Serving of the food and the quality more like an economy class and nothing like a business class. Flight attendants OK except one lady on the return who was rude.,Detractor
From ORD-IST and back in economy. Row 16 and 22 respectively. Our first experience with Turkish. We requested vegetarian meals and a gluten free meal for my sister we all had excellent food and even had fresh squeezed orange juice (at least on the IST-ORD leg). The seats were comfortable too with a recline and a second option to slide the seat bottom outward giving more of a natural reclined feeling allowing better sleep without cramping the person behind you! Hot towels before the meal (I still love these simple things) and Turkish delight before service. The entertainment selection was good movies could have had a better selection but the music was fantastic. From the overall comfort and food quality I was able to sleep for 5 hours on a 9.5 hour night trip. I never sleep that much in economy! I believe their aircraft's sacrifice a few of the bathrooms for food/beverage/storage. It seems the bathrooms get used a bit more though there are never lines. The flight crew kept the bathrooms cleaned several times during the journeys. I would definitely fly them again mainly from the food and comfort perspective. When you put that in comparison to the price it works out pretty well.,Promoter
From Houston TX to Vienna AT via Istanbul and return. I had only 1 hour for the transfer in Istanbul was told that's not enough time to catch the connection flight. That's plenty of time as you just walk a short distance to the other gate. No traveling to the other terminal needed. The flights were very pleasant by the quality of food (salmon shrimps even in economy) comfort and flight attendant service on these flights. Porcelain plates variety choice of food proper cutlery and napkins hot towels. Turkish delight at the beginning of the flight. nice menu cart plenty of drinks and sandwich any time you ask for during the flight. Just the whiskey is not the small bottle was given the glass. Staff very attentive and even transit at Istanbul was hassle-free. The ticket was like U$ 350 cheaper compare to others airlines flying to Vienna!,Promoter

Porcelain plates choice of food proper cutlery and napkins hot towels no stinting on drinks and water. Staff very attentive and even transit at Istanbul was hassle-free.

Only quibble is the very high temperature at which the cabin is kept and lack of individual air control. Would recommend.",Promoter
Guangzhou-Istanbul-Venice. Guangzhou-Istanbul: Comfort class (Premium Economy). Managed 6 hours of good sleep which is more than OK for me. As usual the seat is extremely comfortable.

The Istanbul-Venice flight was just a regular uneventful European flight.,Promoter
I fly Turkish to IST from several locations in Europe in economy. The airplanes tend to be a bit older and the crew tends to be pretty much the same as most airlines have in economy. Catering pluses are the fresh orange juice and warm meal which most other airlines now forgo can't speak about the inflight entertainment because I never use it. However there is one huge negative - the online checking is a mess giving PNR or e-ticket number works maybe 10% of the time and I'm forced to go to the airport early and queue to get a boarding pass even though I don't have any luggage. This is the only Star Alliance airline where this happens to me I've checked with colleagues and they all have the same problem especially on code-share tickets. I've now started to avoid Turkish flights just for this reason as I need to waste about an hour in their huge and chaotic queues at Istanbul which also destroys any potential trip satisfaction.,Detractor
GOT-IST-DAC-IST-GOT on A320 A330-200 back on A330-200 and B738 in Jan/Feb 2015. Mixed review to say the least. Flight delayed from GOT due to bad weather in IST. Middle seat turned down but otherwise standard economy seat and no IFE. Food ok. Arrived late and got a hotel night free of charge at IST since the flight to DAC was next day. Lounge at IST is wonderful and I really felt relaxed before boarding tk 713 to DAC. Old plane poor IFE poor service. The lights in the cabin were blinking all the flight and I was worried someone would get an epilepsy attack. no lie flat seat felt like a plane from the mid-90's. All in all not a pleasant business class experience. Flight back tk 714 on leased 330-200 this time a newer plane good service lie flat also a leased plane from jet airways.

TK8 IAD-IST. Seat 5K business class. Never again. I have been flying Qatar Airways a lot lately - no comparison. Late departure from IAD. Business cabin felt crowded with narrow aisles. Service rushed. Galleys were noisy with no attempt by the crew to be at all quiet. Seat not good with confusing controls (what does MR and M+ mean in the armrest controls?). Armrests and tray table were unmovable. So what if there's a crew member wearing a chefs hat. The food was dreadful. Dried out. Overcooked. Tasteless. Terrible seats. Economy and business class passengers all mixed up with no clear delineation between the two cabins. The lavatories are so small that I banged my elbows in the most minimal effort to change clothes. Waste bins full before we'd even pushed back from Dulles and soap dispensers nearly empty. Unreal. Felt like Aeroflot in 1970. Appetizers dried out. I asked the flight attendant what kind of soup they were serving and she didn't know. So much for pre-departure briefings for the crew. Honestly a poor show for an airline that prides itself on its food. AVOD confusing and boring. Could never find the map. The crew spent most of its time standing at the â€˜bar' looking at all of us like we were monkeys in a cage. Really unbelievable. The soccer stars who are advertising for TK are all flying on private aircraft - make no mistake. If they ever took TK they soon switch to Singapore Airlines or Cathay Pacific first class. FAs walking around with their airport IDs badges hanging from their necks - what is that all about? Really disappointed with TK. For all the hype in their advertising a big letdown. Couldn't get off fast enough. Now have to endure another seven hours to DAR.,Detractor
Frankly a disappointment. I flew Turkish Airlines Business Class recently: Lisbon-Istanbul Istanbul-Seoul Bangkok-Istanbul and Istanbul-Lisbon and it was the least satisfactory business class in recent years. In all flights except the Istanbul-Seoul the cabin and seats appeared run-down and old. The in-flight entertainment was limited and out-dated. The seats comfort was OK but not more than that. The service was friendly and the food was OK.,Passive
"Flew from Paris to Samsum via Istambul and return in Economy. From reading previous reviews on this site and others it seems TA passengers can be separated in 2 categories: Everything went as scheduled and the performance is highly rated or something goes wrong and TA customer service is at best non-existent. Luckily I was in the 1st category. In CDG TA is in the old terminal 1 (not their fault!) which is completely outdated. Departure was a little delayed due to late arrival but we recovered most of it during the flight. Very recent A321 with IFE (choice not outstanding but OK for a 3.5 hours flight). The crew spoke good English (1 stewardess spoke French) the seat pitch is comfortable (at least 10 cms / 4 "" more than AF) the food is fair both in quantity and in quality with a hot meal and a choice of drinks including wine and alcohol. A much better service than their French competitor with bus-type cabin and no IFE. The domestic flight was done on a slightly older A320 with even better seat pitch and here again crew spoke English and served some sandwich and drink. Return was of a similar standard fresh Turkish breakfast in the domestic flight good service and acceptable meal in the international flight. Istanbul airport is not at the same level but it's an other story. Safety demonstrations done in all 4 flights general condition of the aircraft's from good to excellent. Regarding this trip I believe TA is in the top league of European airlines.",Promoter

I flew Comfort Class from IST to JFK. I've always been impressed with the service on economy class Turkish Airlines so I spent the upgrade for Comfort.

The food was excellent I appreciate being given choices for my meals and drinks as well as having porcelain dishware. The entertainment selection is one of the best I've had on an airline.

I have flown with Turkish Airlines three times in the past year. Once from Bangkok to Ho Chi Minh Return (suppose it qualifies as a flight) once from Bangkok to Tel Aviv via Istanbul Return and once from Bangkok to Tashkent via Istanbul Return. All flights were way above average - and I know what I am talking about because in the past 12 months I have flown on TG QF VN SQ NZ and PX on more than 50 return flights. I actually hate flying but have to fly to my place of assignment but flying Turkish Airlines is very good. Most cabin staff - male or female - are very good to excellent (several among the best I have ever dealt with) the food is very good IFE way above average and aircraft in very good condition (staff make sure toilets are always kept clean and are up there TG QF CX and NZ). My only real grip is rush rush at transit - Istanbul Airport not the best in the world although Turkish Airlines Lounge must be one of the best - and one of the A321 I flew on from Istanbul to Tashkent had several rows of non-reclining seats (mine 9C) so I must read Seat Guru more carefully in future.,Promoter

BKK-IST-ARN on A330 and then A321. Flight from BKK late 1h arrived in IST in the midst of the snow chaos. Landed 2h late then stuck on tarmac for 1h. No gate so exit in severe snowfall and winds people in flip flops and t- shirts as this was from Thailand. Shipped on buses finally to terminal in utter chaos as all flights were cancelled. Thousands of people and only 3 TK representatives to help. Took into hotel at own cost rebooked tickets next morning via phone. Then headed for airport again flights cancelled again and no help anywhere and of course thousands of angry passengers stranded. TK head office is a place of shame that gave absolutely no help actually the sour lady just said no and then called for next in line. Result 2 days in IST from own pocket. Flying business and being star alliance gold gives little in this company when it matters. Even refused to be rebooked on other flights. Needless to say last flight IST-ARN was 1h late boarding commenced without communication between gate and crew so business passengers and others too stood 20 min outside of plane door watching crew clean the cabin and stock the food. Quite embarrassing. Was planning another flight with TK in business to BKK but my money goes from now to other carriers.,Detractor
The check-in and departure time are always chaotic with Turkish Airlines. I flew already 8 times with Turkish and they are usually late. Connections at Istanbul are tight which is not matching with the systematic delays of Turkish Airways. If you miss your plane the hotel is provided by Turkish Airlines but the transfer to the hotel is terrible without mentioning the terrible and unprofessional attitude from the visas service + immigration + info desks at Istanbul Airport. Globally I would not recommend Turkish Airways. Even if I omit the delay issues and even if the service on board is OK there is still this something missing that does not make me want to fly again with Turkish Airways - maybe courtesy from their staff. The only point I am impressed about is that even if Istanbul Airport seems to be an organizational chaos the luggage is usually arriving at the final destination even when the time between connection flights are tight (of course if the planes are on time).,Detractor
Flew TK 1332 BRE-IST then TK 716 IST-DEL round-trip. I booked the flight quite spontaneously and TK was surprisingly cheap. Having read that TK is quite good I was a little bit disappointed. Though the food was really great (the Turkish delight is delicious and I like the idea of the fresh orange juice) and I was even given a second menu the staff disappointed me. Perhaps it was only me but I didn't feel very welcome their English wasn't always understandable. Furthermore my flight from Bremen to Istanbul was delayed by over an hour and thus getting my connection was definitely exhausting. When the plane arrived at the gate my last call had already begun. Unfortunately there was no help offered by the FAs. All in all I chose not to recommend Turkish because the onboard product is just average and I prefer airlines being held by more democratic states than Turkey. Nevertheless the flight was quite cheap but in future I will try to avoid them.,Passive

"Flew from DXB-IST-JFK in December 2014 and the return JFK-IST-DXB in January 2015. At check-in in DXB I requested an emergency exit seat for the IST-JFK leg. The rookie check-in agent first said nothing was available but his supervisor stopped by and found one for me. This made the long flight bearable. The flight was packed but the crew were cheerful and efficient and did everything right. Food was so-so - getting a bit weary of the standard kebabs and mystery veggies. The IFE was excellent - far better than Emirates' much touted IFE and better than QR. On the way back was checked in by a surly female agent at JFK. She couldn't find me an exit row on the A-330 to IST but said she found me a bulkhead one on the IST-DXB leg. The A330 was surprisingly comfortable much more so that the 777 even for my 6'3"" frame and the young lady next to me just curled up and slept the whole way through and was no bother to me. On the home leg I found that the seat the JFK agent had got me a seat in the row behind the bulkhead! On the 777 with the seats compressed for the 'short-haul' 4 hour flight to DXB I found sitting was unbearable. I silently cursed this agent and couldn't wait to deplane and get home. Service was once again good and the scrambled eggs were fluffy and tasty. But any satisfaction I got from this was neutralized by the uncomfortable seat and the incompetence of the check-in agent at JFK. This is the second time this has happened to me. A year ago flying from AGP-IST-DOH the agent at AGP assured me she had got me an exit row and I found myself directly behind exit row in a non-reclining seat. TK has to train its check-in staff to read the seat map better. Am contemplating a trip very soon to AGP and then later to BOS and wondering whether to fly TK after these twin disasters.",Passive
Turkish Airlines deserves to be the #1 European airlines! It treats people in the economy class like other airlines treat business class passengers.

JFK-IST-DHA and return in Jan 15. Be advised that planes have no individual ventilation system and were unexpectedly quite warm on all segments. The planes on all segments were dirty. Leaving Istanbul in both directions the restroom had not been wiped down or restocked. There was trash in the seat pocket and in one instance on my seat! There was a marked difference in staff treatment of passengers. On US legs the staff were merely uninterested. On the Dhaka leg the flight attendants were actively rude. Though there was no noticeable turbulence on the Dhaka bound leg we were instructed to remain seated and not permitted to go the restroom for 5 hours. The lady in the seat in front of me called the attendant. Three times the attendant came by and switched off the light and left without asking the reason for the call. The fourth time the lady put out her hand and asked for a glass of water. The attendant rolled her eyes and half an hour later brought a half glass. Also delayed takeoff at Dhaka (which seems to be a hallmark of TA judging from these reviews) caused all passengers on the full flight to miss their connections for the night. The only announcement in the cabin at landing at 6pm was to list the connecting gates. But there were no flights until the next day. There was no assistance with arrangements. The lucky people who knew what to do and had money for a visa waited 3-4 hours outside the airport for a TA transfer to a hotel. Those without experience or funds wandered the airport all night looking for a helpful TA rep to no avail. Never again. I will pay the extra for Emirates.,Detractor

I flew ORD-IST-BOM and back. Checking in and Boarding at ORD was pleasant. The ORD-IST flight left on time and they offered Turkish Delight (sweet) on board with nice touches like hot towels for the face. Istanbul airport is the worst. The gate isn't announced until just 1 hour before departure and until then there is hardly any seating whatever there is it is for patrons of the overpriced restaurants. At the gate there was no boarding plan and no announcements! Just a hoard of passengers moving towards the gate in any random order. The most intriguing factor is their double standard- flights to/from the US serve Turkish Delights and hot towels have friendly staff who speak good English. On flights to India they don't serve any welcome sweet or hot towels and the staff are rude and can barely muster up basic English. On the return trip this double standard was confirmed. Also the flights to the US connect the airport with jetways where as Indian flights have to use a bus! Flights to the US require extra screening which again is done in a totally disorganized fashion and what's more our gate changed after the screening so we had to repeat the screening at the new gate! They ask weird questions going into much more detail than US immigration ever would and make you grossly uncomfortable. Our flight was delayed almost 2 hrs out of IST due to this gate change fiasco.,Passive
Flight 15 Istanbul-Sao Paulo/Buenos Aires as usual operated with Boeing 777-300ER. Flew Comfort/Premium Economy class. This was the best long-haul flight I have taken. What impressed me on this flight was the cabin crew: they were smiling polite and always there. I felt sick (heavy headache) and two members regularly came to me (flight time was 13.30 hours due to bad weather conditions on the Atlantic) to check if I was feeling better or not.

I flew Economy from Istanbul to Lahore. My flight was delayed in Istanbul by 6.5 hours but no one informed us until twenty minutes after the flight was supposed to depart.

We spent two hours walking around the airport like sheep trying to find a single dinner voucher due to the airport staffs incompetence and indifference.

Flew A321 Business class IST-LHR. Seating was economy seating that was very hard. The food and service in the cabin was excellent but was let down by the physical cabin environment. Turkish Airlines should really think hard about assigning these aircraft on flights of 4 hours. The seats are not business class and are quite uncomfortable. For the duration of the flight I sat on the pillow. Additionally there was no inflight entertainment. Turkish Airlines can do better than this. I will think carefully before choosing Business Class again on this airline if this type of aircraft is assigned.,Detractor
Flew LHR-IST on 737-800 Business Class. Inflight Entertainment was OK. Seat comfort was not great and the recline angle very small on this aircraft.

They take care of kids very well too. Montreal to Istanbul flight was a newer plane. They are also not picky about a kilo or two overweight which is great. Per pay lounge in Istanbul is free for kids. For $21 you and your children can spend 6 hrs in an all you can eat snack lounge take a shower and recharge. The negatives were: They put me my wife and 3 yr old and 6 yr old daughters in completely separate seats in different rows for the 2nd leg. Istanbul airport is simply not large enough or updated enough to transit the volume of passenger its doing. I found the airport staff rude and unhelpful on a couple of occasions. I would still fly Turkish for flights that aren't via Istanbul.,Passive
We found it unacceptable being placed in a side room being used to re- charge batteries for electric vehicles! A large group of disabled passengers were left in this dreadful room. Only seating was non upholstered dropdown metal seats with a narrow gap between them. There was inadequate space to pass resulting in feet being stood on and legs being banged every time someone needed to pass. When we arrived in Manchester staff had forgotten to request wheelchairs. In all made to feel like third class citizens. Don't accept disabled passengers if you don't want to look after them. There was very little help for us on this airline.,Passive

Flew JFK-MAN in late December after reading recent reviews I was very hesitant about choosing Turkish. They were the cheapest legacy airlines on this route besides the slight detour to Turkey I thought no problem. Being star gold check in at JFK was easy with no waiting was informed at check in that flight was delayed by an hour due to late arrival of previous flight. I had a 2 hour connection in Istanbul asked the check in lady whether it'll be a problem she said no problem plenty of time. Went into Lufthansa lounge as it was the better option of lounges very good quality food/drinks and very quiet. Only problem was no monitors for boarding I proceeded to boarding gate at the time on the boarding pass and there was a was slight delay. Ended boarded first aircraft was clean and in good condition A330-300. Sat in the first section of economy in window finally departed 2hours late due to traffic at JFK knew I'd be pretty lucky to make my next flight. In-flight service was great food good quality and plenty of drinks frequently. Only part I could fault was the size of the offerings was on the small side besides that FA where attentive and helped passengers in every way. I found the onboard chef a bit of a laugh with his hat and outfit but it is a good look and it's a unique product in the industry. I asked one flight attendant what was to happen with my connection when I arrived - no help just said plenty of flights to MAN daily. Arrival into IST was when my next flight was boarding I thought I might have a slight chance if gates were close arrived to a remote stand and we were bussed in. No one was there to help connecting passengers everyone had no idea where to go I eventually found the transfer desk. Was put on a flight 5 hours later no food vouchers offered or compensation or an apology. I used the 'amazing lounge' which would be great with about 50% less people the lounge was packed it was struggle to find a table or chairs. I tired to get some sleep somewhere but was unable to. Asked to use shower but there was a 4 hour wait I said ok because I had five hours got given a buzzer and waited. Finally boarded MAN flight A320 it was uneventful good in-flight entertainment staff were good but less happy than previous leg. Turkish Airlines in-flight product is very good but they really need to work on ground staff and transfers at IST after that flight I said never again purely because of the transfer.,Passive
Flights 33 and 34 round-trip from Houston to Istanbul from July 26th 2014 through August 10th 2014. They have the best food and inflight entertainment. Their Boeing 777 Cabin is new and looks very nice. They make my flight a real pleasure every time I fly with them.,Promoter

"IST-Paris CDG Business Class A330-200. Boarding at extremely crowded and too small IST Airport was a mess. Surprisingly for wide-body airplane boarding was via buses in pouring rain and it took ages to close the doors which caused almost 50 mins delay. No explanation given. Service not too consistent. Amazing ""little touches"" like welcome drinks of different selection of juices pieces of Turkish delights food was fantastic and it was the best part of the flight. However plane was quite old and dirty cabin crew well groomed but quite robotic IFE ok but no Air Show with a map included (which I found very strange or I couldn't find it for 4 hours). Altogether Turkish exceeds in catering for sure but other than that it is just a regular airline. Flown better.",Passive
OSL-IST-MLA return. A widebody A330-200 aircraft operated OSL-IST sector. Excellent IFE (though no moving map channel or display). The dinner service was almost perfect. Very comfortable seat. Shame that eye contact by the cabin crew was almost inexistent and service delivered in a very robotic manner. Flight arrived at IST with a 1-hour delay. All in all a great flight. IST-MLA on a A320 aircraft in Y/C was very good especially the catering (freshly-squeezed orange juice and lemonade in economy together with turkish delight at the start of the service - very nice indeed). The crew on this flight was very friendly. In-seat audio IFE and moving map display in small overhead screens. Great flight. MLA-IST in Y/C on A320 aircraft. Good service and very good catering again. In-seat audio IFE not working (even though I tried 3 different seats. There was a moving map display in small overhead screens). The flight landed at IST almost 1hr 15 minutes late. Overall a very good flight. IST-OSL in Y/C on A330 widebody aircraft. Excellent IFE. Very good service friendly crew and good catering. A very good flight overall. I'll definitely consider flying TK again. TK must improve customer service culture among its staff (eye contact smiles and do away with robotic service). This is why I would rather fly Lufthansa on this route unless TK has more competitive fares.,Promoter
Pre - and post - flight experience was terrible! Delayed flight by several hours due to bad weather no one can give you information on your long-haul connecting flight that I missed and no business class service! Thankfully they make up for it onboard. Even though it's a narrow-body you have a chef onboard and the food is totally outstanding. You (nearly) forget about all the problems you've had until then! The 3.5 hour flight on an older A321-200 has a 3-3 business class configuration where the middle seat is made into a table. Comfortable. But it's the service and food that made the Turkish flight superb.,Passive
I'm amazed that a 737-800 can fly 6 hours and 20 minutes which is how long this flight from Istanbul to Nairobi was. Who knew! This is a brand new 737 with a 2-2 business class configuration. Not flat beds though just recliner business class seats. Which for such a long flight is a bit of an inconvenience especially given the tix price. Love having the cook on board. From Turkish delight which is served to you at the very beginning of the flight to your meals ending with strong Turkish coffee the culinary experience is outstanding. Service was a bit distracted. They forgot the menu. They forgot the toiletry bag. The lights were never really dimmed off on this overnight flight. But ok it happens some times. This is a great plane for continental flights but am not convinced it works for 6+ hour overnight flights. You're pretty much sleeping upright which is not what you're looking for on such a long flight.,Passive
After our trip just before Christmas from Ercan-Munich 12/12/14 Ercan-Heathrow 18/12/14 and Heathrow-Ercan 23/12/14. I can positively state that we will not be flying with them again if we can find an alternative. The flights were late both directions and the Heathrow-Ercan flight was so late we missed the connection and consequently spent 6hrs plus at Attaturk this is most unsatisfactory from an airline which is supposed to be one of the best.,Detractor
I flew Turkish Air from Los Angeles to Istanbul in comfort class row 11 aisle seat. It had no seats in front of me. This area is very roomy. Comparing to BA's seat room this is great.

This airline just seemed roomier. Good movie selection. I like the snacks and hot cloths.,Promoter
We flew a family of 6 CGK-TLV and TLV-AMS all via IST. First time flying and we were satisfied. Plane departed late from Jakarta but made up in the air and arrived in Istanbul 5min behind schedule and we were on time for our connecting flight to Tel Aviv. It was on a A330 seats felt wider than any other airlines IFE was good food definitely better than average airline food and service from the cabin crew was friendly. The plane made a stop in Singapore. IST-TLV-IST on a smaller 319 without IFE service is ok. IST-AMS on a old very small B737 here the seats felt cramped. Overall TK is a good airline for the price we paid we will definitely use them again.,Passive
IST-BKK a flight we were looking forward to but which disappointed. Our domestic connection was very late but we were given no help at all at Ataturk to transfer to the international terminal in fact an airport staff member tried to prevent us taking the fast route through. The Bangkok flight was listed as only 10 minutes behind schedule so we did not get to the reportedly wonderful lounge but stood in line to board and waited and waited. Flight eventually took off nearly two hours late. Priority boarding OK and a very helpful ground staff who checked that our baggage had been safely transferred. Clean and comfortable Business cabin A330 300 with flat beds and 2x2x2 configuration. Full cabin tiny loos. We sat at the gate for more than an hour with no explanation or apology from the flight deck and took off just before 10pm. Cold drinks before take off champagne after take off dry tepid towel offered. The meal was good but not fantastic and each course took so long to come. Not to use trolleys in a full cabin may look good but slows things down so much. No proper wine glasses we were given our second requested glass of champagne in a large water tumbler! This lack of style and training was obvious at all times. FAs were friendly and obliging but not confident or capable as on many other premium airlines. One had so little English she could not understand us or we her. Good choice of entertainment but the amenities bag was awful. Posh bag very little inside no face cream and the slippers had been used and recycled. Poor storage and FAs had no idea what to do with pillows and duvets once passenger luggage was in the racks. Completed breakfast orders were not collected but we handed ours over. The hot part of breakfast was worse than any premium cabin we've flown in: flabby white toast inedible unseasoned eggs. No announcement from the flight deck about our lateness of arrival or apology/explanation of why. No local time check either and when we asked a FA he got it wrong by an hour! Hope our return trip is better.,Passive

Great service from the hard working and friendly crew from Washington Dulles to Istanbul flight TK008. I was given emergency exit seat - being 6 foot 6 inches tall it was highly appreciated. The drink selection and quality of food is good - the best I have had on an airline. The plane was clean and bathrooms were well maintained. The service even in economy was of good quality and crew are professional and friendly. I will fly with Turkish again. The crew take pride in their job and go out of their way to accommodate. I enjoyed the blanket slippers and inflight entertainment. I continued on to Amsterdam on TK1955 and received the same high quality service.,Promoter
Istanbul to Washington TK007 on Nov 272014. Flight was not full and I had 3 seats to myself in the back of the plane next to the bathrooms and food cart storage closets. This is a busy area but the extra room was worth it. I can only say great things about this airline. The crew work very hard to make sure everyone is well taken care of. Turkish delight at beginning of flight is a nice touch. Drinks were served throughout the trip and were of good quality. The food was of excellent quality for an airline and all in all I really like the feel and modern clean design of the cabin. Seats appeared to be new and were comfortable. I had plenty of room for my knees which was a relief being that I am 6.5 feet tall. In flight entertainment system and film selection is top notch. I was so thankful to have chosen this airline as the price was a great deal and the staff were professionals. Landed Thanksgiving evening right on time. What more could you want in an airline.

GRU-IST 19/12. Could not upgrade to Premium Economy as the flight was overbooked. I have to say this is the first time I felt like the cabin crew did not care that much for passengers. Food was also of a lower quality than usual. Istanbul-Venice 21st December. Flew on a 738 with no private screen. Cabin crew was fantastic on this flight.

The seat comfort on three segments was slightly disappointing as the seats were identical to economy class ones just the middle seat blocked off with the sole exception of the IST-ASM flight that featured the new business class configuration. The food offered on board by DO&CO was fresh and generous in both quality and quantity without being to overwhelming. The ambience and general service on board was genuine and of high standard without being too pompous as with most premium products. The cabin crew were extremely polite and professional and most seemed to be warm and quite friendly. Ataturk Airport is wide and spacious offering all functioning facilities the security procedures are very lenient and quickly handled with no hassle or long waiting. The customer service staff at Ataturk Airport are satisfactory as most don't seem very keen to assist you although they do their jobs.

TK33 Economy IAH to SSH via Istanbul on November 21 and again November 30 2014. TA exceeded my expectations in all aspects of the flight. Food on the flight was abundant and of a very good quality. Staff were attentive and helpful throughout the whole flight. Inflight entertainment was varied with pretty good choices. Seat was ok but after a 14 hour flight everything seems a little uncomfortable I guess. The only negative was perhaps the craziness encountered at Istanbul Ataturk airport and the uncaring attitude of people at the airport. TA is pretty good value for money and I will not hesitate to use it again in the near future.,Promoter

Disappointed with 1st flight no welcome on board and certainly no smiles only 6 passengers in business class. 2nd flight lovely welcome smiling staff food excellent lots of tasty dishes small helpings and freshly prepared.

After my outward bound flight from Amsterdam to Kathmandu (TK1952 and TK726) I was ready to write a rampage of discontent if the return flight was anything as bad. For almost a month from mid-November the Istanbul-Kathmandu sector had never been less than four hours late except for two or three days when it left Istanbul two hours early! On the day we travelled there was a six hour delay meaning we had to wait at Istanbul airport for 10 hours. No excuse or apology was offered. When we eventually boarded they had changed the aircraft from the day before when we had booked our seats online so we found ourselves sitting in seats next to the toilets and with no recline. There was also no IFE. Clearly the aircraft was from another era. An hour after we eventually took off (0200) and when I was finally nodding off to sleep I was rudely awoken by one of the crew and offered breakfast - at 0300! I was also offered wine with breakfast! So it was with some trepidation that I awaited my return journey fully expecting a long delay and wait at Kathmandu Airport which is no pleasure! Fortunately from two days before my departure the flight was running on time. What a different experience. A new(er) plane that had IFE an excellent service from the cabin crew on both flights. Why travellers to Kathmandu were singled out for such delays when nearly all long haul flights are on time remains a mystery. Because of the risk of it happening again I would not fly Turkish Airlines to this destination but otherwise I find them more than acceptable.,Detractor
Good service from crew on Dub/Istanbul leg in newish 737. Istanbul to Tbilisi on Airbus. On return to London via Istanbul flight out of Tbilisi was cancelled due to fog.

Turkish Airlines staff are normally brusque and indifferent but when one of their flights is delayed they really excel themselves in terms of inscrutable disdain. Firstly TK0805 to Istanbul (5/11/14) the cabin crew didn't seem to think anyone had the right to know whether we were going or not. When we finally took off over an hour late they were affronted that passengers might want to know if we were going to meet the connecting Turkish flight to London. So not having an answer and not seeming to care they just blithely said 'yes it'll be held'. Everyone rushed to the gate. Low and behold it wasn't held. Sent from pillar to post to interact with various other stony-faced employees who frankly don't care. Not a single person ventured an apology.,Detractor
Brussels to Istanbul. The plane was clean and smart and the staff were helpful and well turned out. Standards of English from staff were also very good. The food was very tasty. The inflight entertainment didn't appear to work in any seat on the inward flight though it was good on the outward flight with a decent choice of movies and TV shows. You are offered a piece of Turkish delight after take off which is a nice touch. Turkish Airlines is significantly better than its home airport.,Passive
TK60 from IST to KUL in economy. Food and beverage service was as good as the food itself definitely 4-star standard. However the crew had a new trick which I have not seen before: One of the two front lavatories was reserved for crew use. It was clearly visible from my seat that the crew locked the door from the outside after they were finished using it. Reducing the number of lavatories on a plane is not a good idea. To add insult to injury the crew never bothered to clean the passenger lavatory resulting in an abundance of overflowing sewage. Wrote to the airline and did not receive any type of response. I recommend taking rubber boots on your next TK flight.,Detractor
Istanbul-London Heathrow. Bus to the aircraft â€“ happens so often these days at Istanbul. The chicken meal had run out by the time the cart reached me. Meal I had was good and I relaxed for the rest of the flight. On descent they announced that they would come round for newspapers cups etc but they did not. During the taxi to the gate people started getting up all over the aircraft even though there had been an announcement not to do so but none of the crew attempted to stop them. Luggage was already on the carousel when we arrived. The flight itself was good but efficiency of the crew in my area was appalling.,Passive
I flew business Dublin to Bangkok via Istanbul. First leg of the trip was ok on par with premium economy but no business class. The leg from Istanbul to Bangkok was the worst flight I have had. We arrived late into Istanbul from Dublin and were running late to catch the connecting flight aircrew told us that ground staff were waiting to escort us once we had disembarked well once we had been dumped by the bus at the terminal gate there was no staff to help just the usual mess in Istanbul. We eventually found our gate which lucky for us was running late. So as business class we had priority boarding but in reality this was only onto to the bus which then with everyone else on the flight dumped us in the pouring rain at the rear of the aircraft and we had had to fight our way through to our seats at the front. We took our seats and after some time were offered some water or juice â€“ same as economy. There were 5 airline staff looking after a full business class plus the 2 chefs. The service offered did not reflect. About half an hour after take off face wipes were offered however mine was cold and smelt -â€“not offered a replacement. We were offered a drink I chose champagne which when arrived hardly wet the glass with the quantity given and was warm. A short time later the meal was served which was ok and edible. I managed to get 2 glasses of wine from the crew during the meal. Crew were in a hurry to get your trays packed away and 2.5 hours into the flight all alcohol was locked away and never seen again. Crew took themselves of to hide behind their curtains and not to be seen until 2 hours before we landed when a miserable breakfast was served which I had not ordered. There was 1 business class toilet to service the crew and passengers and the crew seemed to have it in use 80% of the time in the last hour when most passengers were also trying to use it. There were no amenities in the toilet hard paper towels no small cups sink was filthy floor wet. Finally after disembarking in Bangkok getting through customs etc quickly through to the baggage carousel I expected that our bags would be out quickly as we had priority baggage no they came out last and after just about every one else had left the Airport. I have flown Turkish economy before and have found them to be very good and thought that business class would be good but it was awful.,Detractor
Flew IAD-AMM and return from Malta to IAD in November. Flew Business Class round trip. Can't say enough good about the flights as everything from check in to landing went on-time smooth with excellent service both on the ground and in-flight. Considering that I saved over $1000 per person on this routing compared to BA LH and any of the domestic carriers - their in-flight service was far superior to the other transatlantic carriers I've flown over the past 25+ years. Would compare their service to Cathay Pacific. The meal service was outstanding. I've never had meals of this quality before on any airline in First or Business Class. You have to experience it to believe it. Great value for the price I paid and the wonderful service received. Any future business I have going that way - I'm sure to fly Turkish again.,Promoter

We used Turkish on 5 segments for a group trip where many members arrived in IST for a 2 week trip. Of the 22 members of the group who arrived from all corners of the world nearly everyone had a story about Turkish failings. Business class on TK46 from IST to KIX was a perfect example. Plane was a beat up 330-200. Boarding was a mess. Loaded onto a bus in IST in the rain. Driven around the tarmac for 15 minutes to our plane. All passengers loaded through the rear of the plane on a mobile jetway in the rain. To get to the business cabin we had to 'swim upstream' to our seats. After settling in to 4a and 4b (in the beat up cabin) discovered that the toilets (tried to find a clean one of the 4) had not been cleaned. The cabin crew could not be bothered. The seats are not lay flat. The remote did not work. Don't believe the hype.,Detractor
I had a short 2-hr flight from Naples to Istanbul before transferring to JFK-NY. It was a full flight and they were far over their overhead storage capacity by about 8 carry-on suitcases. Often you'll be a few spaces short but I've seldom seen that many. I imagine the problem was caused because the airline check-in agent was not enforcing the 1 carry-on 1 personal item (which is to be pushed under seat or held on your lap) policy. This is negligence on the airlines part. However the flight attendants did the right thing by keeping on the carry-on luggage onboard and not putting it beneath the plane therefore allowing us to be on our way quickly. They offered excellent service with full meal alcoholic beverages and newspapers offered free on a 2-hr flight. The service on the flight from Istanbul to JFK was also quite good. However for whatever reason they did not allow you to pick your seat when you book (at least the system didn't when I tried) so as I result I got stuck in a middle seat which I always try to avoid.,Promoter
Avoid this airline and avoid any transit through Istanbul. Recently flew with Turkish Airlines LHR-IST-TLV-IST- LHR. Cabin crew are cold unfriendly and indifferent to passengers. I was on a scheduled connection home from TLV via Istanbul with a one hour connection time. By the time the aircraft parked offloaded passengers and we cleared security in the transfer lounge I arrived at the gate 10 min before he next departure time only to be told that the flight had closed and I couldn't board.

Two completely different experiences. Took a flight from Los Angeles to Istanbul. It was fabulous! Even in coach! The flight staff was so pleasant and attentive. Took the flight back from Istanbul to Los Angeles and it was a completely different story. The flight crew was absent. In 13 hours the beverage cart came by twice and only to serve meals. The crew at the gate were so rude and disorganized. By the end of the flight there was trash everywhere. I was shocked on upon exiting the plane that even First Class was a pig sty. They did offer cheese sandwiches and drinks if you walked to the back of the plane but it was an absolute madhouse. I did nothing but rave about my experience until my return flight. Sad to say that I'd probably never fly TK again.,Passive

My recent flight on Turkish Airlines was with mixed emotion. Inflight service was excellent. We flew with Turkish Airlines from Dubai to Athens with one stop in Istanbul. The flight from Dubai to Istanbul was 40 minutes late and we missed the flight from Istanbul to Athens by 5 minutes. One would think that since it is the same airline and they knew their flight was late which contained passengers going onto a connecting flight to hold the flight for 5 minutes and also have staff waiting at the exit gate of the first flight to express process passengers in order to make the second flight. I was traveling with my pregnant wife and we had to wait another 5 hours for the next flight. Two other couples were not so lucky as they had a connecting flight to Skopje and they had to wait until the next day. They were given the choice of sleeping in the airport lounge or to pay for a visa for each person to sleep in a hotel outside the airport. One of the couples had a baby who would've been about a year old. We were compensated with a measly food voucher worth no more then 4 Euros each. There was a huge line at the flight services counter with many people experiencing the same issue with connecting flights. It seems they have not got the hang of how connecting flights should work and the gap between the flight times.,Detractor

They were given the choice of sleeping in the airport lounge or to pay for a visa for each person to sleep in a hotel outside the airport. One of the couples had a baby who would've been about a year old. We were compensated with a measly food voucher worth no more then 4 Euros each. There was a huge line at the flight services counter with many people experiencing the same issue with connecting flights. It seems they have not got the hang of how connecting flights should work and the gap between the flight times.,Detractor

We travelled from JNB South Africa to London via Istanbul. The trip to and from South Africa to Istanbul was excellent. Staff good and the seating had ample legroom. Unfortunately the same cannot be said about the flight between Istanbul and London. The seats were old with very little padding most uncomfortable and with little legroom.,Passive
AMS-IST-AMS- smooth check-in in Amsterdam and Istanbul. Boarding is very good. Business lounge in Ataturk airport is fantastic! I frequently fly with Turkish Airlines including transatlantic flights.The meal service was excellent and stuff was very helpful! Best meal I ever had on all flights. The flight entertainment had great variety of movies and games. I will fly Turkish again on my all flights. Thank you very much Turkish Airlines!,Promoter
Flew IST to BJV flight TK2510 return TK2509. Both flights full. Kept to schedule. Crew did their job well but not much interaction. Food better than expected for a short flight. Seats comfortable with relatively good leg room. A good airline.,Passive
Rome to Istanbul. The original flight was initially delayed but we were given little information. Eventually we were told another aircraft would be coming from Istanbul and we would be given a meal. There were so many restrictions and inconsistencies with the meal provided. Information on the flight was not available despite several requests. Inaccurate information was given regarding the need to change boarding passes. The ground staff were next to useless and when the supervisor eventually arrived he was boarding of downright aggressive and would not rectify our problem with boarding passes. The flight was underwhelming. Inflight entertainment system was not working and my requested special meal was not available. On landing passengers were walking around the aircraft as it was moving. The cabin crew did nothing and even laughed at the child running up and down the aisle as the aircraft was moving.,Detractor
BRU-IST-BRU c class - rather smooth check in BRU. Used fast track and lounge. TK uses SN lounge in Brussels which is always too crowded understaffed and unclean with little food choices. Especially if you bear in mind 2 UA flights 1 AC and one Hainan plus all of El Al and Turkish and all of SN and other Star Alliance flights all sharing this non Schengen lounge at the same time! Too vile and disgusting. No Senator members lounge at all! Even Vienna has got one. Boarding was the usual TK mess but must say flight ok A320 excellent configuration and experienced staff. Expecting an A330 as earlier planned but change of plane (must say not enough pax). Arrival in IST using fast track arrivals plus optional lounge in IST a breeze. Return again smooth check in Istanbul plus fast track plus lounge a breeze and absolutely exquisite for a business class lounge! Now boarding was the usual TK mess remote gate and all that jazz on board crew too busy arguing about something or other and service was dull and boring but efficiently done! disembark ok no fast track no need really in BRU and suitcase one of the first out! good. Will think twice before recommending though.,Passive
First time on Turkish this summer. Flew From JFK to Tirana via Istanbul and return from Podgorica via Istanbul. Although I had some reservations flying with Turkish at the end I was more than happy that I chose them. The meal service was excellent. Best meal I ever had on a transatlantic flight. The A330-300 was comfortable and the flight entertainment had great variety of movies and games to choose from. I reserved our seats 3 months in advance by calling the call center. Our seats were all promised as we originally chose them on all flight segments. Again I will fly Turkish again on my next transatlantic flight with no reservation.,Promoter
Bad: I flew many times between London and Istanbul always on business class. I have had enough of it. Their planes are old seats are most uncomfortable little leg room same seat as economy but with spare seat in the middle. They also always make you take shuttle bus to terminal both inbound and outbound most inconvenient. I had to help carrying the luggage up the steps for an elderly lady. Hate it they think it is a popular routes so why bother improving it! Wrote to customer service twice no response! Good: Better food and lounge than BA.,Detractor
I made 2 trips to Dhaka last year and both ways missed the connecting flight in Istanbul. The reason is very short lay over time which is only one hour. Though hotel accommodation was given staff are not friendly. My visa fees were not reimbursed. This route is the best for LAX-DAC-LAX because it takes shortest time to reach Dhaka-LAX vice versa.,Detractor
Recently I travelled with them on four sectors each averaging 2.5 hours. The gimmick of a crew member wearing a chef's outfit is just that - a gimmick. Service onboard is hit and miss. On some flights it's good on others it's mediocre. There are better airlines operating in Europe.,Detractor
"Non-stop from Istanbul arriving in Boston 30 minutes late. My husband and I chose TA for non-stop reasons because we are in our 80's and wanted to avoid mid-journey transfer. Both trips exceeded our expectations. Chose business class had row 2 each way with just two seats long enough for us to really stretch out and sleep. Cabin was quiet and darkened for relaxing. Food and wine choices were fine and nicely presented. Even ""candlelight"" via a tiny paper lantern with battery light inside. Staff very helpful. Only complaints are the long wait for baggage in Boston and confusing / absent signage for boarding at Istanbul Airport.",Promoter
BEY-LHR via Istanbul. Flight was delayed by 45 mins to depart from Beirut. Flight was packed from Beirut to Istanbul operated by an old A321 with no personal TV. To be honest one of the things that was brought to my attention the carelessness of the cabin crew in checking seat belts and providing the appropriate safety demonstrations no announcement was made from the captain at all during the whole flight. Nevertheless once we got to Istanbul I nearly made my connecting flight to LHR. Again flight was operated by an A321 with no ptv which I found very surprising. Again service was not great however they served good food. Overall would not fly again with them due to their very tired aircraft's being used on the route and due to the service of both the cabin crew and the hassle for connecting passengers in Istanbul.,Detractor
IST-VCE-IST - Boarded pretty much on time but departed Istanbul 1 hour late with the aircraft sitting on the tarmac with Ataturk airport almost always congested that's nothing new. Cabin very hot and stuffy until the end of the flight. Of course no beverage service until 40 minutes into the flight. 737-900ER which looked brand new cabin very clean nice looking seats but with typical THY pitch so not much space to move. Reclining button missing/broken so impossible to move the backrest. Nice choice of movies on the IFE and big screen when the thing worked the whole system rebooted on all seats after a while and my lucky colleague next to me has his rebooted a dozen times or more until the flight attendant attempted to fix it by rebooting it a few more times and then gave up. Service as usual with THY OK if you don't expect too much the only friendly and smiling stewardess was the one who did not speak any English. Return flight on A321-200 departed on time from VCE and full almost to the last seat. Good for them. Slow food service with only 2 stewards each with one trolley and that took ages mine ran out of beef kebab after the 10th row. The 2 of us had beef served cold and mine was some kÃ¶fte dish which was not even on the menu. I guess it was some leftover from a previous flight and re-heated twice the lid was already open and it was stone cold. My colleague had the time to finish watching his movie from the previous flight and arrival was on time in IST. Every time I am stuck with flying Turkish I wonder how they manage to get Europe's best airline award and now for the 3rd year. I guess the people who evaluate do not fly the same routes as me and never in economy.,Detractor
Another fantastic journey with Turkish Airlines. Sao Paulo-Istanbul: flew Comfort class which in my opinion is excellent value for money. Seats were only 50% taken in this class and I could thus enjoy three seats free for me. The space and comfort of this class is comparable to Business class of many other airlines. The seat is wide the space for legs is exceptional the IFE was also nice with noise cancelling earphones distributed. Service: top notch. Food was of very good quality in abundance and served with almost Business class layout (real plates and real towels) both for breakfast and the dinner served two hours before landing in Istanbul. Cabin crew was discreet but always present when needed: I asked twice for some juice and had the glass delivered at my seat within a couple of minutes. Did land in IST after 12 hours and 45 minutes with a delay of 2 minutes. I just keep recommending this airline.,Promoter

"I read some variable reviews before booking my flights from NJ to Istanbul so decided against direct flight and booked United to Munich then TA to Istanbul then TA back to Frankfurt and Lufthansa back to NJ. TA was by far the best parts of the trip with over-the-top service plenty of stretch room in business class (I'm 6'1"") and solid quality food. I liked the repeated options to grab another croissant / roll or requests whether I wanted a refill of wine or coffee. The Airbus A330s I flew were new and immaculate. My only complaint was the boarding process which wasn't well organized in Munich at all with a long narrow gate where everyone across all classes congregated and blocked any chance for an organized boarding. Had I not been near the front I would have been one of the last to board despite my business class seat and never heard a call for that class to board. The return trip was a bit better with the gate agent asking out loud - not over the PA - whether anyone was in business class and directed us to a separate line that was initially hidden from view. I would definitely recommend TA to other passengers traveling in business class and would take fly with them again if given the option.",Promoter
Flew Montreal-Istanbul-Bangkok business class. On both legs the flight was fantastic the food was in abundance almost feeling like there was too much. Inflight entertainment was great. The first flight had the side by side seats that go into full sleep position and were great. The 2nd leg had the pods which I actually found slightly less comfortable. The service was great except for one thing on my Montreal flight when I had to ask 3 times for some water. I still find their inflight service excellent and very attentive.,Promoter
"My husband and I took four economy flights in the last couple of weeks between London and Antalya via Istanbul. We chose Turkish Airlines over the lower cost carriers as it has won several awards and had better arrival times than Easyjet etc. Check in at LHR was chaotic and staff were disinterested and inefficient. The flight was delayed. In fact all four flights were delayed. We were unable to book legroom seats on the first flight (my husband is 6'6"") but were able to move once the flight was underway. As we were going through the gate for the second flight the staff grabbed my boarding pass took a pen and scrubbed out my seat number and changed it. When I asked why (no explanation was volunteered) I was told the plane had changed. On boarding I was in an entirely different part of the plane to my husband in between members of a young family despite there being spaces next to my husband. Needless to say I moved once the flight was underway. No apologies from staff. On arrival international passengers were separated from domestic and taken to the international terminal to receive our suitcases. After waiting for a long time (late in the evening) someone eventually came and told us we had been sent to the wrong terminal. No apologies. No directions as to how to get into the arrivals hall of the domestic terminal. Eventually found it - everyone else from the flight were long gone. On arrival at Antalya airport 2 weeks later to take our two flights home check in again was chaotic. Asked for legroom seats - we're given them for the first flight but not the second. No explanation or apology. Legroom was non existent - even I struggled to fit. My husband found it impossible. We asked if it was possible to move and we're told no - no explanations or apologies. Again others were seated separately and there were a couple of heated conversations which the staff dealt with very poorly. Once the flight was underway and the seatbelt signs were off my husband stood up finding a spot out of everyone's way. The person in front reclined their seat making it impossible to sit back down when told to do so. My husband explained this politely to a very abrupt attendant and was told in no uncertain terms to sit. No care understanding or apologies. I pleaded with the guy in front to put his seat upright and my husband retook his seat. His knees were up against the seat in front and the magazine rack cut into his shins. Food dreadful. Seatbelt signs kept on for most of flight and flight attendants almost invisible for the rest of the journey.",Detractor
Milan-Istanbul-Sao Paulo. Milan-Istanbul: quite old Airbus A320 with limited entertainment onboard. As usual excellent hot meal distributed. Very nice and efficient cabin crew. Long transfer at IST Ataturk Airport. For such a reason Turkish paid a very nice hotel for me (5 stars) located in the city center. Free transfers also provided both ways. Istanbul-Sao Paulo: 13 hours daily flight aboard a new 773-full flight. I got the emergency exit which means a lot of space for a better rest. The 3-3-3 seat configuration in Economy is extremely appreciated and TK is one of the few airlines world-wide which still keeps it nowadays. Very young and pleasant cabin crew. Meals: overall two hot meals - tasty and well-presented. IFE completed with a wide range of movies and TV programs. Live TV and free-wifi onboard definitely a plus. First long-haul flight with Turkish. Can definitely keep recommending.,Promoter

"Travelled VIE-IST-JFK-IST-Vie at the end of July. We booked Premium Economy with TK to N.Y. for a family trip as TK offers best value in this class (only slightly more expensive than the cramped Y-class on any direct flight from Vienna to N.Y. in peak season unfortunately there is no Premium-Y ex Vienna). 3 days befor departure we received note from TK that due to an aircraft switch ""Comfort Class"" (only on TK's 777) would not be available on the 10-hour flight from IST to JFK thus we were offered a later flight. I requested an update to C-class instead which was duly granted - a great move from TK and just what I expected from ""Europe's best airline""! Our 2-hour morning flight to IST in Y-class was comfortable sufficient legroom menu cards were distributed and a hot and tasty breakfast was served (fantastic service having in mind what other airlines consider as catering). Our connecting flight was in C-class so we enjoyed the marvellous TK lounge at IST airport that streches over 5000 square metres on two levels - try the freshly brewed Turkish Coffee! The flight to JFK on an Airbus A-330 in business class was as comfortable as it can get (welcome drink fluffy duvets flat beds Do&Co flying cooks meal courses were served one after the other as it should be dedicated and smiling FAs a wide range of movies). Bottomline: we arrived relaxed and happy. Only a minor point: cabin design could be slightly more colourful. Unfortunately our flight back to Vienna via IST was not upgraded so we travelled in ""Comfort Class"" as planned. Seats are in CC are wide and legroom is plenty. There were no welcome drinks and meal service started way behind C-Class (keep in mind that the flight departed at midnight!) but the meals dinner and a full hot breakfast before landing all served on china were tasty and satisfying. The amenity bag distributed in ""Comfort Class"" wasn't Porsche-design like in business but nevertheless came in very handy. At IST we spent some time at the ""Prime Class Lounge"" (we pre-booked this service before we departed) where you can take a relaxing shower after a long-distance flight. The final leg of our journey took us back to Vienna in Y-class in the late afternoon. Again menu cards with an extra drink/wine-list were distributed prior to dinner service once again an amazing service by TK considering the occasional sachet of pretzels - it at all! - other airlines serve on 2 hour flights. Final verdict: I wholeheartedly recommend Turkish!",Promoter
Flew business class with my wife from BHX to IST. Comfortable enough on both legs but late departures on each flight. Cabin crew were good to excellent though service rather grudging and not as attentive as my experiences with Emirates. Aircraft cabin littered on both legs.

Biggest problems on return leg was hopelessly disorganised ground staff: chaotic hectic and not at all relaxed or smooth as one would expect in business class.,Passive
Booked Business Class BHX to DEL via IST. Business Class Service on the BHX to IST very hit and miss. Steward seemed nervous took my order for drink and forgot to bring me the drink. Later on during the flight the FA took my order for a drink and this one came. Flight attendant serving drinks without bringing them on a serving tray certainly shows me that the Turkish Airways staff need training and overall the service in business class was poor. The lounge at Istanbul is very good. Istanbul to Delhi boarding a shambles. No segregation between Business Class and Economy on boarding especially if you have to travel to the plane by bus. IST TO DEL - one of the most uncomfortable business class seats in the air. I travelled on 22/8/2014. I am going to travel in Business Class on the same route BHX to DEL VIA IST on October and I am hoping for better service. If there are no improvements I will go back to Qatar Airways or Oman Air from Heathrow.,Detractor
Traveling from St Petersburg to Istanbul in business class - very disappointed the business class on this ageing 757-800 was no better than economy class. The seats were economy did not recline more than 15 degrees. The centre seat of an economy row was made inactive by folding it down. Hence calling the two seat arrangement business class. Extra leg room was there but was of no use as the footrest was fixed. How can they be called the best airline in Europe when they do not provide the basic requirement for a business class seat.

Traveling from Boston on August 22 the flight was scheduled for 11.45 we waited several hours without knowing what was going on until. At 3 am they told us the flight was cancelled and we had to recollect our baggage. They sent passengers to different hotels some as far as state of New Hampshire. Crammed us to the bus while some passengers did not have a seat and there was not enough luggage space. On August 23 they told us the flight will leave at 6 pm.

TK66M IST-SIN on 31/8/14 - The THY lounge at Istanbul Airport whilst impressive was very busy and noisy. It is not a place to relax. Already the lounge is starting to show signs of wear and tear despite opening only recently. The entry gates were mostly broken and barricaded off. On this visit the hot food had all but disappeared which was disappointing prior to taking a 1am flight to Singapore. Flight was OK cabin crew not very interested in passengers and disappeared for most of the flight. The flat beds on this aircraft seemed quite hard and was difficult to get comfortable and to sleep.

IST-BHX. I have flown on Turkish Airlines about 60 times over the last 18 months. I have noticed a general decline in the quality of service. This was very marked on my last flight from Istanbul to Birmingham. The seat I has was almost worn out and very uncomfortable. The cabin service was poor. They offer a choice of meals but do carry enough of the options to provide choice to all. On this occasion they had given all the meals out of my preferred option after only 4 or 5 rows of passengers. They did not offer any option. During the 4.5 hour flight I was offered one drink and my calls for another were ignored.,Passive

TK 2421 Antalya to Istanbul August 11. TK 66 Istanbul to Jakarta August 12. We have always enjoyed TK and have flown it many places around the world each time in Business Class. There does seem to be a difference in both the service and attitude on the 330 vs 777 airplanes. The 777 FA's are more caring and do not disappear after service. After numerous long haul flights is seems that the FA's on the 330 are less trained and really do not care. Yesterday on the Istanbul to Singapore flight a FA attendant was smashing the pillows and blankets into the overhead compartments even if they were full of luggage. It was a disaster trying to get the hand carry out of the overhead because of all the bedding. Another thing is the food. When a flight leaves Istanbul at 1 am on a 10 hour flight the most important meal is breakfast not dinner. We have yet to have an edible breakfast even in Business Class. The eggs are a messy runny non-recognizable mess or there was some mystery Turkish pastry breakfast that was like rubber. You would think that with nobody eating the entrÃ©e that they would stop serving it. The funny thing is that the meals served in the European Business Class are quite good. The Business Class lounge in Istanbul remains the best in the world. We love spending time there. Unfortunately they boast if having thousands of flights daily but the airport in Istanbul cannot handle nearly as many as they want to fly. The taxi ways and concourses are a disaster. You would think there would be separate lines for Business and Economy like the rest of the airlines in the world but no. We will continue to fly Turkish Airlines because we feel safe and the price is right. Occasionally we get a good flight crew. But it is all hit and miss. The one consistent thing about Turkish Airline is that you cannot apply one word or phrase to describe them because they always are different.,Passive
BUD-IST-KIX (Istanbul-Osaka) and return. Short range A320 and B737-800 were a bit tighter seated but the A332 on IST-KIX and back was very spacious. We took row 32 or so (do your online check-in 24 hrs in advance) where config is only 2x3x2 - legroom was great. Seat comfort for my 90 kgs also acceptable but a bit high armrests. Food was plentiful and excellent in quality with metal cutlery (long gone since the '90-s from most fights unfortunately) even trilingual menu cards were provided on all legs with 2 choices on the long range ones. Both long ranges being (mostly) night fights cabin attendants got all window blinds closed after service so all pax could sleep rather well - even on the backwards leg where plane was 90% loaded. Cabin crew were very attentive and thorough - what I rate the most is that they checked all seat belts and seat tray window blind etc. before landing and got everything arranged right. Toilets were kept clean in the aft cabin all the way through free beverages and snack stocks were kept available constantly. Inflight entertainment runs (obviously) on some Android old op.sys tablets integrated into seat backs and mine was stuck somehow though but did not ask for assistance. Flights were punctual (no delays) and crew were smiling.,Promoter
Flew Nairobi-IST-Boston return. While aircraft and cabin were fine food definitely above average and a bird strike was professionally and safely handled by the pilot (take off aborted switch to new aircraft) I was not happy with the following: 1) Very difficult to get hold of Turkish Airlines office by phone. I wanted to inquire about changes to my ticket. In Nairobi I had to end up making the journey to their downtown office in person because no one answered the phone. In the US it was equally difficult to get hold of anyone who could help with ticket changes. You can also only pay any change fees in person at the airport (this alone took an hour prior to the actual check in and ended up being USD 80 higher than originally advised). In Boston there is also no on- line check in available. Turkish is just not equipped with the kind of services that makes this much easier with airlines like KLM BA Delta etc. 2) Horrible experience at Istanbul airport. Again wanted to go to a ticket office to inquire about changes during my layover. In the entire international transit area there is none! It was also incredibly difficult just to find someone who spoke adequate English! After going in circles I was finally told I need to get a visa exit the airport go to the ticket office outside then re-enter! It was also by far the dirtiest airport I have been to hardly saw cleaning crews and if I did they were standing around talking rather than working. Neither ground staff nor cabin crew particularly friendly on a four leg trip one flight attendant stood out for trying to be particularly helpful. I had chosen Turkish because at the time it was the cheapest option the few hundred dollars saved were not worth it because of the other hassles gained.

While aircraft and cabin were fine food definitely above average and a bird strike was professionally and safely handled by the pilot (take off aborted switch to new aircraft) I was not happy with the following: 1) Very difficult to get hold of Turkish Airlines office by phone. I wanted to inquire about changes to my ticket. In Nairobi I had to end up making the journey to their downtown office in person because no one answered the phone. In the US it was equally difficult to get hold of anyone who could help with ticket changes. You can also only pay any change fees in person at the airport (this alone took an hour prior to the actual check in and ended up being USD 80 higher than originally advised). In Boston there is also no on- line check in available. Turkish is just not equipped with the kind of services that makes this much easier with airlines like KLM BA Delta etc. 2) Horrible experience at Istanbul airport. Again wanted to go to a ticket office to inquire about changes during my layover. In the entire international transit area there is none! It was also incredibly difficult just to find someone who spoke adequate English! After going in circles I was finally told I need to get a visa exit the airport go to the ticket office outside then re-enter! It was also by far the dirtiest airport I have been to hardly saw cleaning crews and if I did they were standing around talking rather than working. Neither ground staff nor cabin crew particularly friendly on a four leg trip one flight attendant stood out for trying to be particularly helpful. I had chosen Turkish because at the time it was the cheapest option the few hundred dollars saved were not worth it because of the other hassles gained. The early morning departure and arrival times in Nairobi also make an already long trip even more painful.,Detractor
"TK1850 ATH-IST June 19. ATH airport check in procedures swift my luggage checked to my final destination boarding passes provided for my subsequent flights with another Star Alliance carrier.

Travelled on TK 0069 with my wife on June 13 2014. We mentioned to the air hostess that our table trays could not be closed and were staying in the locked position as it was broken. The flight attendant could not assist us and were not willing to help. Plane was very old and in bad shape. Food was served late after 2-3 hours when everybody was sleeping.

Flew IAH-IST in business. Cabin was nicely appointed and comfortable and the inflight entertainment works well. The food and drinks offered were high quality and plentiful except my fish entree was over cooked. The service was awkward. It was a full hour after takeoff before the in flight service was started. Food was prepared in the forward galley and plated in the rear galley which meant there was constant cabin staff traffic between the two galleys making the cabin environment frenetic. Beverages were only offered once at the beginning of the meal service. Any additional beverages including water required a direct request with an attendant who would then readily provide another beverage.,Promoter
LHR - Istanbul - North Cyprus - Istanbul - LHR. Business class to Istanbul economy to North Cyprus. Flight to Istanbul departed on time. A321 seats not really business more economy plus as it's 3 seats across with the centre seat blocked off and a little more leg room. Very early AM flight breakfast good flight nearly full. Entertainment not that good. One hour transfer time at Istanbul was no problem at all in fact we did it in 10 minutes. Flight to North Cyprus B737-800 seat ok food surprisingly served on an hour flight entertainment system not fantastic. Flight from Istanbul to LHR was just fantastic mainly because of the Turkish business lounge which is as far as I am concerned is the best of the best. Food space comfort facilities all there in this brand new lounge all excellent. Flight on B737-800. Aircraft type changed at the last minute so passengers seated all over the place. Everyone seemed civilised onboard and just swapped seats onboard so couples could sit together. Chef onboard and food prepared by DoCo just sumptuous. Cabin crew all male in business were terrific. Aircraft full seats again more eco plus then business and no real entertainment system on this plane. Pilot informative flight smooth landed on time.,Promoter
Venice-Istanbul-Beirut. Venice-Istanbul: brand new A321 with individual screens and IFE plus a full hot meal provided (with a printed menu distributed). Broad selection of beverages even fresh orange juice available. That's amazing for a 2 hours and 15 min flight. Flight attendants: most of them very friendly and professional apart from a young girl who seemed not to care at all. Smooth and easy transfer at Istanbul airport which by the way is a total mess and way over-crowded. Istanbul-Beirut: full flight. Again new A321 but this time with very small individual screens with no IFE. Super friendly and professional cabin crew. A cold meal offered. Luggage did make it to Beirut without any issues.

TK604 Dar Es Saleem - Istanbul 8th August 14. Incoming flight delayed due to bad weather at Istanbul Airport. Check in staff at Dar Es Saleem seemed clueless about how to sort problems re prospect of missed connections. Eventually assured us that we were booked on later 19.10 hours flight to Heathrow and gave assurances our luggage would be transferred. On arrival at Istanbul received the worst customer service experience. Staff rude unhelpful and incompetent. No bookings for onward flight found initially told we would have to overnight in Istanbul only after continued insistence with staff were seats found for us. On boarding flight TK1983 we found over 30 empty seats on the aircraft we were told there were no seats available. Of course arriving back at Heathrow they had managed to loose 5 items of our hold baggage. I would never fly with Turkish Airlines again.,Detractor

The TK0051 flight landed in Istanbul at about 19.10 h when the scheduled landing time was 18.00 h. Although I rushed to the gate where I arrived at 19.26 it was impossible for me to get the connecting flight which departed at 19.20 sharp. There were at least 6 more passengers in my same situation. Nobody was waiting for us at Istanbul airport to give us assistance no help was offered. We went to the ""customer care counter"" where a Turkish airlines worker simply gave us instructions to go to the transfer desk. After a very long queue a Turkish Airlines employee explained to us that there was no available flight to Madrid that day. We had to get flight TK1857 departing at 7.50 am next day. Turkish Airlines would provide us with a hotel dinner and breakfast.

Istanbul-Lagos had terribly worn out Business Class seats. USB plug did not charge my phone only neighbouring seat did so. Headset cable was broken only one side could be heard. Way back it was worse: Checked in but was not offered an invitation to the lounge so I had to bribe someone to get me that instead of again going through security. Then 75 min departure delay without any notice information etc. which made me miss my connection in Istanbul. The onboard entertainment system was completely off apologies for the technical defect. Not to mention the USB plug for charging the phone. After the 7hr night flight no breakfast or simply a coffee was offered. Never again if I can avoid it somehow.,Detractor
"We have flown Turkish Airlines several times in the last year and always with a little hesitance connecting through Istanbul-an airport that's always a bit chaotic. While the flights we've had over the years have been good in terms of food price in-flight service and entertainment etc today was quite the opposite. My wife and kids flew to Istanbul from Macedonia intending to get on a flight to Chicago. Instead they were told at the gate that the boarding passes they had received for the flight were not adequate and there were no seats for them. They were turned away and sent to a ""help desk"" that was a nightmare. It took hours to rebook them on tomorrow's flight and they were denied hotel accommodation even though it was the airline's fault. Next time we'll book with a proper European carrier likely spending a little more but saving ourselves the headache and worry.",Detractor

Travel agent booked me on a Malaysia Airlines flight which was code shared with Turkish airlines Turkish for first leg from Istanbul to KL then Malaysian from KL to Sydney. Boarded in Istanbul and the check-in staff couldn't have been less helpful. The first person at the check-in counter passed me off onto someone else because of what she called a 'ticket problem' before promptly going on her break. The second person was slightly more helpful up until the point someone came around and told him to go on a break. Then it became too hard to do anything more than check me in onto the Turkish airlines flight. He wouldn't check my bag through to Sydney no real reason given but from previous experience it is possible to check bags through despite different airlines in operation. This meant that once I arrived in KL I had to clear customs pick up my bag and then check back in again. A massive pain and something that wouldn't have been achievable if I had had less than 3 hours between flights. First and last flight with Turkish Airlines!,Detractor
TK12 and TK571 JFK-IST-JRO departing July 3rd 2014. Had multiple terrible experiences with TK in the last year the most recent of them in July 2014 on the first flight of our honeymoon! Every time I have flown with TK from JFK or BRU the flight was late by more than 90min without any explanation. Leading to a missed connection and being stranded against our will in Istanbul. Each time the in-flight crew assured us the connecting flight would be informed and wait for us. Each time there was no one upon landing to direct us and help us find our connection gate. Each time we missed the connecting by less than 10min after desperately running across the airport to try and make it. Each time the ground staff for luggage collection and transfer/hotel arrangements were unduly rude and totally unhelpful. And the hotel provided for the night was very sub-standard. And each time we had to pay an entry visa that we would otherwise not have had to pay. I have flown a lot of different airlines and this is by far the worst experience I've ever had. In the latest occurrence they would not even make a nice gesture to acknowledge the fact they were ruining the first 2 days of our honeymoon. Needless to say we will never fly Turkish airlines again if we can avoid it.,Detractor
26 July 2014 United 7781 (Operated by TK) TK370 IST-Tashkent. I have had a very mixed record with TK. Previous flights were in the acceptable range but things seem to be going downhill. I am much taller than average and have found the latest flights to be torturous in terms of legroom. On my most recent trip I had to skip the meal because I did not have sufficient room over my legs to lower the tray table. Cabin staff were good but ground staff were decidedly a mixed bag in terms of helpfulness. Entertainment consisted of the 1970's-era pop-down screens.

June 18-21. Ankara (ESB) to Istanbul (IST) and to Rome Fiomicino (FCO).TK 2109 and TK 1965. I have been flying with Turkish Airlines for about 10 years. Mostly I enjoy excellent flights. Luggage is rarely lost. Out of 100+ flights it happened once which was likely due to a non-Turkish Airlines connection. Food is halal and of top quality. Most of the fleet is brand new. Once in a while you get an old one which makes the flight experience mediocre. The miles program is great but they started reducing the number of miles that can be earned. One thing annoying is the in-flight announcement. The pilots better stay silent instead of trying to speak with their low- level English.,Promoter

Istanbul to Thessaloniki on a morning flight. Boarded the plane. Two crew were working in the J cabin (including senior crew member). Load of J cabin only 6. They handed out the menu for the service before take-off which had hot breakfast choices. After take-off the crew started the service. Without any interaction the crew member came and passed me the tray. Tray consisted of a fruit yoghurt croissant and a selection of cheese. Never asked me if I would like anything to drink or which hot meal choice I would like. I got up to visit the toilet before the seatbelt sign came on. The J cabin toilet was unusable for its respective cabin customers as the crew allowed a Y cabin customer to use the toilet and he threw a whole tree of paper in the toilet. The other crew member asks me finally if I would like to have anything to drink. Asked for a Turkish coffee. After I came out asked a crew member to take my tray. Then comes my coffee. That's when the seatbelt sign came on. Nobody came to secure the cabin before landing. Landed in Thessaloniki. Waited for our luggage on the carousel only to find the priority bags arriving last. At the end of the day a short flight is a showcase of what a long trip can be with them.,Detractor
BRU-IST-BRU C cabin - check in is unfortunately a mess no priority check in respected staff not interested don't give a damn attitude. Done by Avia Partner. Had to ask twice for a fast track card for arrivals in IST check in staff did not even know they existed. and they have 4 flights to IST daily. Lounge is always full and dirty and am afraid boarding is always a mess even you are flying c class. From wait in lounge to designated gate to last call all of this in less than 10 minutes simply ridiculous. Experienced this many time. Once on board all is different - friendly yet professionals staff with lack of language skills but ok on security and service. Some try to go the extra mile. Only option to IST direct. They need to improve ground staff and boarding skills and attitudes otherwise I would perhaps recommend. IST lounge on Sunday 27/07/14 announcement from no info to go to gate to last call gate closed 15 mins. Too many flights too little doors even if they are remote they have lost it - they need a third airport.

"JFK-ATH business class round-trip in June (TK0004 & 0001). Departure from JFK was delayed by almost 3 hours as the pilot could not be found. On arrival in Istanbul we had to go the ""transfer desk"" to find a connection to ATH. Said transfer desk has a queue of over 100 people from every conceivable destination and no priority for business class. End result was that we had to sit for 4 hours in the biz-class lounge and watch 2 codeshares fly out before TK. Yes we missed our connecting flight in ATH as well. Return ATH to IST managed to be 2 hours late as well for a 90 minute morning flight. This time we barely made the JFK connection and our ""priority"" luggage was delivered 2 days later.

BHX-IST-BKK. July 9 2014. Boeing 737-800: BHX-IST. Very impressed with Turkish Airlines European business class. By far the best of all European carriers for comfort and privacy. It offers a 2-2 configuration with 20' leather recliners with additional foot rest. There is a personal VOD monitor in the arm rest with a wide variety of shows and movies for a 3 hour flight. Flight attendants are very polite and professional. Food catering is of the highest standard to match and surpass other European Carriers like BA KLM or Lufthansa. Airbus A330-300: IST-BKK. The TK business class lounge is very impressive with kids room multiple TV rooms 2 grand pianos and some of the cleanest toilets I have seen at an airport. Lounge provides user friendly lockers to store your belongings. A bit chaotic boarding at IST. The shuttle bus used to take passengers to the aircraft was a bit overcrowded and ground staff seemed a bit disorganised. However after boarding it's all up hill. FAs were very attentive and professional. The personalised chef for the forward cabin was a nice touch. Good selection of food and drinks and the inflight entertainment is more than adequate for the 9 hours and 40 mins. Seats are very comfortable for business class with an exceptional amount of leg room although the seat configuration of 2-2-2 does not provide loads of privacy for a single traveler with the two end seats A and K not giving direct aisle access. Overall Turkish Airlines provides a very good product in business. Will definitely recommend and travel again in the future.,Promoter

The flights were all very good. Leg room varied. I had adequate legroom on the B737 and A330 but I felt crushed on the B777. The food was tasty and the flight attendants offered good service. My main issue with Turkish Airlines with the customer service on the ground. leading up to my flight I found frequent outages with their US website.

Planes varied - the least good was a workaday Airbus between Istanbul and Izmir (nothing wrong with it though) the best a brand new B737-800 to Gatwick.

Travelling from Alanya/Gazipasa to Istanbul via Ankara the first disappointment was that there was no online check-in. At the airport you are allocated a seat which cannot be changed as the system doesn't allow it said the young lady on the desk. No lounge but such a small airport and only one or two flights a day hardly warrant it. In fact the Turkish Airlines printed timetable doesn't even list the flights there. I went into the airport shop for a can of Coke but at TL 7.25 decided it was too much of a rip-off. No priority boarding so a scramble at the gate. Flight operated by Anadolujet was comfortable and a sandwich and water tea and coffee served. At Ankara the domestic transfer passengers were sent straight into the departure area which meant no second security screening. But inside I discovered my next sector was delayed and the Business Class lounge was outside so I could not reach it. Luckily the delay was not long and soon we were boarding. They made an announcement about pre-boarding but then just let everybody go through. Full flight and had another sandwich and cake. After landing at Istanbul we had to sit on the ground with the engines running for 15 minutes before a gate was available. My luggage was the last up - seems they don't use priority tags at Alanya either. But at least I was able to go to the airport shop and buy a can of Coke for TL 1.75!,Detractor

Flew non-stop Houston to Istanbul in Comfort Economy. I had low expectation however it was a pleasant experience. From check-in to boarding the process was well managed. I was greeted with a smile while boarding and found the Comfort Economy area quite spacious. The seats were 2-3-2 with decent cushioning leg room foot rest and in seat IFE. The seats did not allow reclining for a comfortable sleeping position but let's not forget it was $350 more than basic economy fare. Here is the more pleasant part: the cabin crew were full of smiles and were pleasant. No attitude or doing the passengers a favor type behavior. The food service was good and well portioned. I don't get this much polite and pleasant service in business class of major US carriers! The arrival at IST was timely however we parked at a hard stand.

"I have flown with TK a couple of times this year. The majority of flights are disappointing. Most recent flight was on 20 June 2014 from Riyadh (KSA) to Paris (France) via Istanbul. Leg 1: TK141 was delayed (as usual). Flew with an old A321. Very tired and dirty. Business class seat was an economy seat. Most of business class passengers complained about the seats (it was an overnight flight and most of us wanted to sleep - but it was impossible). Crew was ok - nothing exceptional (typical TK). Food was average - I am really wondering why they have the-so called ""Flying-Chef"" on board. Leg 2: TK1821 was delayed as well. Flew with a new A330-300 featuring the new business class. Much space and a fully flat bed. Although business class cabin is spacious it is not sophisticated at all. Cabin was dirty. Food was just ok. Crew was unprofessional and rude.",Detractor
I had return flight CDG-TBS-CDG via Istanbul by Turkish last month. The service overall was really excellent. The food was very good nicely presented and tasty. Cabin attendants were professional in all flights nothing to complain about. Seats are ok for a couple of hours flights with the overhead screens and consequently limited entertainment. I have three observations for improvement: 1) The Business lounge in Sabina airport is very unpleasant a box size room with no edible food available. 2) The Ataturk airport (I had it for return flight) was extremely busy and flights are usually delayed for 30-45 minutes. 3) I observed that the light in cabins during the boarding catering (almost two hours) and landing was extremely bright (it is annoying when there is late evening or night flight). In general Turkish and Lufthansa are the best choices for Tbilisi.,Promoter
Flew from IST to ESB on A321. The Business class configuration is typical of the European short haul flights with the middle seat left empty. Legroom is limited and hardly an improvement over Economy. Aircraft was showing its age and as with all TK flights I have been on the air was stuffy and stale. Flight attendants came across as aloof and did not seem to be interested in engaging with the passengers beyond the most basic requirements of their duties. Good meal service for a short flight. There was moderate turbulence throughout the flight resulting in spilled drinks. The FA's did not bother to clean up the spill on my table even though it was evident at the time they collected the meal service. The crews on TK really need to improve their English skills as their announcements are barely understandable and would represent a real concern in the event of an emergency. As well my experience on all of TK flights leave me questioning the safety culture of the FA's as they tend to ignore basic in-flight safety breaches such as passengers standing up while the aircraft is taxiing and leaving their tables down during takeoff and landings. The flight left late due to congestion at Istanbul airport but was otherwise uneventful. Their domestic service is clearly superior to North American and many European carriers and is certainly good value for money. With some attention to cabin service and improved FA performance this airline can easily maintain its status as Europe's best but has a long way to go to compete with Asian and Middle Eastern carriers on long-haul routes.,Detractor

TK21 PEK to IST. Orderly and on time boarding. Was asked to relocate to a different seat than the one pre- assigned in order to accommodate a passenger with physical disability. Ended up in a window seat as no other aisle seats were available. The Purser tried very hard and apologized profusely. A warm approach I am not used to receiving from TK FA's. Cabin as with many TK flights very warm and air stale. Comfortable lie-flat seats with plush blanket and soft pillow. The shell style seats do not offer much storage room and are narrower than other business class seats. Attentive service throughout the flight with FA's frequently checking on passengers. Good meal and wine selection although main course was somewhat tasteless. AVOD system with 20 inch screens and a wide selection of movie and music options although somewhat dated. The highlight of the flight was the free WiFi which is a very nice touch. Overall a pleasant experience.,Passive
TK 0035 IST Ataturk-Montreal June 17 2014. Booking the flight one month in advance: both my travel agent and I tried to secure an exit row seat. I expected to pay for it. The airline was impossible to reach from Canada. At check-in the seat selected by the travel agent was changed to an unacceptable one. A request to upgrade for business cabin was denied. On the ground at Ataturk a long and very slow line-up in the corridor just to enter the gate (an additional security check - we have gone through the passport control as well as the security already). Not a single seat available. The security agents behaved like Canadian immigration officials interrogating people about purposes of their trips but no information was going into computers. Younger people were sitting on the floor older ones standing there with their bags looked tortured already. The plane was jammed full. The seats in Economy were really cramped no legroom (a 10hr flight). Rude FA's and completely devoid of smiles. Dismissive and unhelpful to boot trying to ignore passengers as much as possible.

Flew TK041 from Johannesburg to Istanbul on 12 June. The flight was full and as a result it was one of the most cramped flights I have experienced. Not for the faint hearted. The major issue is the A330's they use on the route are old and tired. The upholstery was worn through and coming apart from the seats. Very tacky for an airline striving to be one of the world's best. There was minimal leg room in fact on sitting down my legs were already jammed into the seat in front. I don't think I would fly with them again - will probably take the longer route via Dubai. Emirates' seats have far more leg room on the 777's.

The food and drinks were well presented including â€œcandlelight dinner high above the clouds.â€ The bathroom was kept clean through-out the flight the fresh flowers inside and immediately outside were an unexpected touch. Only complaint was the lack of expedited customs upon arrival. Will fly with Turkish again they certainly provided a high quality international flight.,Promoter
Recently flew Istanbul to New York City in Business Class using United Air Miles. Very comfortable seats which allowed a potential good sleep. Food excellent though it took a long time to serve and we all were anxious to sleep it was evening. There were two problems: the restroom was filthy from the beginning of the flight. Floor was sticky trash overflowed the bins and was on the floor. When I told Flight Attendant I don't believe she really understood. She told me to use the restroom in Business Class but this was in Business Class. Second problem was it seemed families with young children (infants and toddlers) were invited to use Business Class as a free upgrade. This was nice for them but having two screaming youngsters for several hours was hard on the rest of the passengers. Turkish Air has a great reputation so this was a disappointing flight. Check the bathroom!,Passive
VIE-IST-TLV-IST-HAM: Outbound flight from VIE to IST with A 330-200. Much legroom excellent food freshly squeezed juices and very tasty hot meal. Flight attendants were smiling and friendly and did a great job to complete a full service within 2hrs 45 min. Flight left on time arrived on time in IST. Smooth check-in and boarding in Vienna. Transfer at IST airport very easy. Plenty of shops and restaurants the only downside is that there was no airbridge available for the next flight to TLV. No seats available at the departure gate and very cramped. Flight from IST to TLV was excellent. Brand new A321 with personal TV on each seat. Again FA's very friendly and they served a hot meal in the middle of the night (flight was 1 hour 40 min). Return flight from TLV to IST again a very new plane flight left punctual at Ben Gurion airport FA's smiling and friendly all the time. Again a smooth transfer at IST connection to HAM. Older aircraft from IST to HAM but enough legroom even in Y- class. I have no doubt to recommend this airline. Especially the catering and the onboard meals are fresh and tasty from Turkish Do&CO. Turkish is much better than most of the European airlines. Will choose them again.,Promoter
We recently flew from Chicago to Istanbul to Tel Aviv. The experience was very positive but where Turkish Airlines really stood out was in providing gluten free meals. They were of excellent quality and out of four major meals there were no repeats. Really beat the standard white rice and dry white chicken most airlines serve every time. It helped make a long trip easier.,Promoter
BRU-IST-BRU 1 class both legs Boeing 737-800 great C configuration. Good efficient check in and SN lounge not as good as BA which was the usual lounge in BRU. Boarding a mess but once on board rather good service comfort and tranquility Two remarks on board though menus are getting very boring if you fly TK often as I do on European routes and bathrooms are used by everybody and FA do nothing to stop it! Third remark is BRU boarding which is always a mess! Arriving in ST when C pax a bliss due to the fast track on arrivals. Will recommend and use them again already book the next 3 trips!,Promoter
We flew from Rome to Istanbul business class staff food and aircraft were excellent no complaints on this 3.5 hour flight. We then had a two hour wait for our flight to Hong Kong in premium economy on Turkish Airlines. Again everything was excellent. Only thing I could say they should get their boarding process more efficient. Everyone was seated near the boarding counter (flight full or nearly full) we had been sitting there for an hour a person came in and told everyone to move we thought the gate had changed. No. We were moved outside the door past another counter and then had to line up show our boarding pass which part was torn off and then had to sit back where we were originally. Sat there for an hour. After all passengers were seated back where they were the staff member then proceeded to zap all the boarding passes it seemed like 6 times. Why I don't know that is usually done in one process. We then lined up in lines marked A B C D and then flew to HKG. Great flight service and nice clean planes.,Promoter
Delhi to Istanbul was terrible. Old flight with bad quality of seats. The entertainment system was not working for the whole flight. Asked for water as it was peak summer and did not come until the beverages started. The crew were curt. Flight from Istanbul to Sweden was better quality but again food was pathetic. Sweden to Istanbul food was bearable. Istanbul to Delhi - again entertainment was not working. Never again will I take this flight. Thankfully there was 1-2 crew members who were a bit courteous else would have given a single star on each parameter.,Detractor
I've flown with Turkish 4 times since Jan 2014. This weekend (29 May to 1st June) I flew with them again from Riyadh to Geneva and return. First flight Wednesday night was crowded but boarding went well and was relatively quick. Onboard the plane was not clean the supposedly red seats were much more black the carpet was dirty and entertainment system outdated. Flight attendants were rude. The food as usual was quite good. Landing at IST was ok. Airport is not the nicest but not bad. Nevertheless I still do not understand why you have again to go for a full security check while in transit. Then we boarded for GVA starting with a bus ride crossing the taxiway and queuing. The plane was again outdated and not clean at all. Again flight attendants were not smiling and the entertainment system did not exist. Yesterday I did the same trip back same conditions same services same outdated planes.,Detractor
Critical flaw - staff do absolutely nothing to enable best possible chance to make connecting flights. TK feeder flight late leaving Antalya late arriving IST bus 10 minutes around tarmac as no airbridge! No staff waiting to expedite transfers. I am a regular traveller and always every attempt is made to enable connections. It's basic. TK international flight also delayed so not leaving for one hour - staff just tore up my boarding pass rather than even attempting to get me on board! The implication was significant.,Detractor
BRU-IST C class Airbus 330. Good check in and sn lunch. Very busy day at Zaventem full everywhere sn class leaves much to be desired. Boarding messy but once on board all went very smoothly. Food not that great hardly changed the menu and flew them at least 6 legs just this year. Passport control for C class pax a dream and good delivery of bags. All in all good will use them this coming weekend again.,Passive
"BOS-IST-BOS. The flight was fine but ground crew in both Boston and IST were uncommunicative unhelpful and more involved in talking with each other than in helping passengers. 4 hour delay leaving BOS with promises to update ""in 15 minutes"" no further info for an hour. Nasty little sandwiches provided around 2am but not enough bottles of water to go around. I travel a lot and I've never seen such an unprofessional ground crew. Boarding in IST chaotic. No announcements no signs. Constant ""security checks"" but no computers used so no real verification of identity info. Wanding being done incorrectly. Security staff asking passengers detailed questions about the reasons for going to the US where they were residing etc. as if they were US Immigration - but nothing going into computers to be transmitted to US authorities.",Passive
AMS-IST-AMS Business Class. Their Lounge at AMS has been reduced by 50% which can get uncomfortable during the busy hours. Food and beverages are scarce. But it's a clean friendly environment! A340-300 to IST just a few business class passengers. The seats are worn but not worn-out. I preferred a low calorie meal which turned out to be fish. The meal itself was good enough. We landed on time. My flight outbound from IST is always late no matter the weather. Late boarding late departure. My plane was already there! Service on-board was good. Business load [sold seats] was high. The best part of the trip is the CIP lounge!,Passive
LGW-IST-CPT return. Great value flight. Check in at LGW easy and quick and very pleasant staff member. Simple flight to IST and a 6.5 hour wait with little to do. Recommend Cafe Nero for a really good cup of tea while you wait. Flight to Cape Town was reasonably pleasant but staff were a little sniffy especially the females. Food was fair but nothing special. Inflight entertainment was awful. Provided headphones were of the earbud type really uncomfortable and wouldn't stay in the ears. Sound quality was horrible. Return leg was an unsuitable for long haul plane which was full after it stopped in Joburg. The meal on take off was delicious. The staff on the return leg were one of the most hard working I have encountered making up for the poor plane. However the breakfast was served cold and was uneatable. Same meal was served on the IST-LGW leg and we declined it. Security check at IST on the return leg was horrible. One South African woman bleeped while going through the gate and was the subject of what I consider rough and unnecessary treatment. Would consider flying again but only if the price was right.,Passive
"BUD-IST-YYZ-IST-BUD. BUD Ground services are horrible confusing and mean spirited towards the passenger. The inflight hard- ware experience is very good (seat toilets aircraft IFE etc.) but the human resources are like a lottery of low probabilities of meeting a winner or just someone to recall after a weekâ€¦BUD-IST-BUD sectors on A319 and B737 respectively. Only 2 rows assigned for business class and the seats were economy seats. However with only two passengers for the 12 seats available space was more than enough and one could lay down stretched out by lifting armrests. As for B737 there were old but true business class seats in a 2x2 configurations in 3 rows). Flights on time. Excellent service on board. Champagne at take-off. Special meal ordered almost a year in advance was given. Three more hot meals were presented and given by FA who were proud of their many options. Thus I had cold seafood platter as starter hot salmon as 1st maincourse and as 2nd main course: kofta 3rd main course: pasta and 4th rice with giant prawns. Cheese platter of high quality. Good advice on wines. IST-YYZ-IST on Boeing 777-300. Perfect hardware (inclusive WiFi) and excellent food. However the staff (FAs) has a lot to improve on - Language Socializing Read and understand passengers minds and needs. They need to avoid speaking Turkish to ""all"" passengers and could recruit a bulk of international staff to beef up Spanish Chinese Vietnamese Thai French Arab and â€¦English. The timing of service inputs need improvement. Sense of FA-humour is nil FA's avoidance of passengers is felt -â€“ one could sit on the entire flight without being offered more than 10% of what are available.",Passive
TLV-IST-YYZ on B777-300. Staff were friendly and helpful for the most part. Great In flight entertainment with large personal touchscreens USB and AC ports. Free Wi-Fi offered. Seats were fairly comfortable and planes in great condition. Ordered a vegan meal (VGML) and got a vegan hot meal with dairy salads deserts and butter - however staff were helpful and replaced salad and desert with vegan ones. Food quality was good but nothing to rave about. Fresh squeezed juice pop and alcoholic beverages were offered. Overall satisfied and would fly again. Great value for only $850USD round-trip.,Promoter

While planning a trip to Istanbul we decided on Turkish Airlines mainly due to low fares out of Houston. We booked economy and were a little concerned due to some negative reviews but we have no regrets but do have a few observations. Check in at Houston was fine we decided to upgrade to comfort class at check in there was no offer or signs we just asked. It cost us $350 each for one way but we are glad we did it. Roomy seats nice amenities and good food in comfort class. The in flight entertainment was not so great mostly older movies but we slept just fine. We had concerns about the temperature in flight and yes it was too warm. On our return from IST the check in was chaotic at best. Flight was fine food and amenities were about the same as comfort class so we are glad we did not pay to upgrade. Overall we would not hesitate to fly THY again.,Promoter
This was the first time I've flown Turkish airlines so I wasn't sure what to expect. The flight from Houston to Istanbul was great and flight attendants were fantastic. But the flight from Istanbul to Houston was bizarre. I had to show my ticket stub 4 times to prove I was in the correct area (not just me everyone had to show their ticket stub) and they placed stickers on unoccupied seats so they could tell if someone changed seats. Turkish Airlines apparently has a weird policy of not letting customers upgrade to premium seating when seats are available. They spend way too much time monitoring the empty seats. They really made my trip feel cheap and uncomfortable.,Passive
I read so many bad reviews of Turkish I was a bit sceptical when I boarded. The flights we took were round trip from Houston to Istanbul. I was pleasantly surprised by the entire experience. The plane was comfortable with adequate legroom in economy. Very good inflight entertainment system. Food was excellent. We especially liked that snacks/drinks during the mid-flight time (after first meal and before second) were all self service. Very convenient. My only complaint would be the lavatory got messy fast and never really felt clean. Flight out of Houston was one hour late out of Istanbul was right on time.,Promoter
Washington Dulles to Istanbul Business Class. I was re-routed from a cancelled flight onto this one and what a nice surprise it turned out to be. The flight arrived on time and the cabin crew were very polite. The service was excellent with on demand entertainment comfortable reclining seats to sleep in and a complimentary meal service. This was not at all like flying with the USA's airlines where the staff are usually brusque and rude and the service generally terrible. I very much recommend Turkish Airlines for long haul business class.,Promoter
IST-YYZ. Pretty much a good experience except that the overhead luggage storage was completely stuffed full as we boarded the aircraft. This created tension and stress as we did not want to store our belongings way down the aisle. We discovered that it was in fact the cabin crew that had plugged the overheads with their personal luggage and not even the crew from our cabin. I have flown with Turkish many times and I wish they would understand that little things like this do matter very much to the traveller.,Passive
19th April Nairobi to Istanbul. The cabin crew responded well and were kind I was also comforted by the Boeing sky interior in the Boeing 737-800. We took of on time and landed 15 minutes early. Return flight on 29th April was a bit hectic after we missed our return flight to Nairobi Turkish Airlines offered to help us and after clearing with them the main problem was our bags. They told us that our bags would be transferred from the lost and found desk directly to the aircraft. Would recommend.,Promoter
Travelled from Birmingham UK to Dhaka Bangladesh via Istanbul the on-going flight was ok. The return flight was not as pleasant the inflight entertainment system was not working. I asked the cabin crew if they could help but they were far too busy. Eventually after a long wait I was relocated to another seat similarly on the new seat the inflight entertainment system was not working. I had to make the entire journey (6 hours plus) with nothing to do. As a result I would not recommend Turkish Airlines.,Detractor
Houston to Delhi on 26th and it was quite impressive. Staff were attentive food was excellent and service excellent. I travel at least twice every year to India and this has been the best I have encountered.

I am looking forward to my next trip on 11/05 with a stop in Istanbul and heading to Chicago on 22nd.,Passive
JFK-IST-TLV and return. Flew with my family to Israel for Spring Break. This was my first time flying with Turkish Airlines and will not be my last. Flight attendants were very nice to me for all flights. Food was very good! Eggplant stuffed with minced beef was fantastic! JFK-IST and IST-JFK flights had good IFE with many music and movie selections to choose from. TLV-IST and IST-TLV flights had no inflight entertainment but this was only a two hour flight so I just slept. Seats were nice for economy. If only airlines in the US learned from airlines like Turkish. A very good experience.,Promoter
Flew MAN-MBA return in April. Both legs to and from MAN-IST were full. The service was great with a full meal and a good selection of drinks for economy. We had Exit row seats and had ample leg room. Full use of the entertainment system on these legs (good for 3.40 hour flight) and a decent selection of films however the games were not much to have. All fights on time and no luggage issues. Check-in staff in Manchester were very good and helpful and Mombassa staff polite friendly and obliging too. Long-haul flight on single aisle 737-900 service good though not quite the same high standard of the MAN-IST leg. On 7 hour flight to MBA only one full meal service thought they could of managed at least another drinks service many passengers went to the galley to get a drink. The return flight (4.00am) an average breakfast was served and sandwich snack before landing same entertainment system. This flight also included flight socks and shades which was a plus. FAs were friendly on the whole (male FAs more so then the female) though not always obliging and scarce once the meal service was over. Overall a really good experience and superior too many other European airlines would not hesitate one bit to flight them again in fact would prefer too - price wise very competitive and even cheaper too. Look forward to flying with them again. One tip - give yourself time to transfer at a busy Istanbul airport.,Promoter

Travelled ESB-IST-LHR and return 2/4/14 and 7/4/14. Both sets of flights and aircraft were satisfactory. Flight between Ankara and Istanbul is short so the crew have just enough time to give out the picnic baskets of food before descent commences. Sandwiches are served on the domestic flights which are ok but not a substitute for a proper meal. London flights were ok food was served within the first hour of the flight but then the cabin crew were almost non-existent for the remainder of the flight. Selection of food was not available to me on both international flights probably because I was sat in an exit row half way down the aircraft. It was beef or nothing. Connection between the two flights was stressful as navigating Ataturk airport customs is a long process. The most disappointing thing about the flights is the attitude of the cabin crew towards the safety rules. Many passengers on Turkish Airlines do not observe the seatbelt sign and will get out of their seats while the aircraft is taxiing to open overhead lockers. This occurred on all flights and the cabin crew were indifferent and didn't say a thing on all occasions. This is a very different attitude compared with other airlines. The command of English of the cabin crew and at times the pilots is quite poor also which is surprising for a growing international airline.,Passive
DUB-IST-PEK and return. Check-in slow at both DUB and PEK due to group travel. All four flights full. European sectors particularly good with very friendly smiling and welcoming onboard staff and food above average. IST-PEK outbound delayed by almost 3 hours with no explanation given. Service good staff efficient but indifferent on the long-haul flights with food below par on occasion particularly breakfast. Dinner on both long-haul sectors meals edible. Drinks plentiful with frequent top-ups. Entertainment excellent with plenty of choice of movies and programming. Will definitely use again but a little bit more required to maintain 4-star rating.,Passive
LAX-IST-BCN and return. Turkish continues to be a favorite with the finest catering I have encountered on any airline. On the intercontinental segments both the appetizer and the dessert are chosen from a cart laden (truly) with an incredible selection of options. The menu is extensive and provides something for every taste. While food in Business Class is generally good on every airline Turkish takes it to a new level and provides and experience worth anticipation. The crews are friendly and the seating is comfortable for long flights. All services were on time and the Istanbul Lounge is a wonderful place for relaxing between flights.,Promoter
TXL-IST-KRT return. With Lufthansa stopping its flights to KRT in January no major European airline flies there anymore. Thus flying from Europe the shortest route one has to take either Turkish Airlines or Egyptair. Since I had good experience with THY in the past I took them once again and have no complaints except for the 50 mins delay on the IST-KRT leg and the fact that they stopped serving alcohol on flights to sharia-law countries such as Sudan. The food was good and seats in the 738 were comfortable providing sufficient legroom even for a 4.10 hrs IST-KRT flight. Ataturk airport has been renovated since my last visit there and the wait for the connecting flights was quite pleasant.,Promoter
I fly every 3 weeks on Turkish. Having a good experience is like a game of roulette. Some aircraft's are excellent others very old and shabby. Economy class does what it says on the tin but Business class is generally below the standard of peers. However one thing is constant: the poor level of service. If anything goes wrong or if you have a special request just forget about it and remember this is an emerging airline. Cheap A to B in economy why not? But as a business traveler I cannot honestly recommend Turkish.,Detractor

I flew from JFK to Madrid and back from Rome to JFK. Outbound flight was not a good one with a delay resulting in missing our connecting flight to Madrid but it was mainly due to heavy snow and delay at JFK itself. However the returning flight was a real nightmare: We (family of 4) were not given the seats we reserved on the phone with the airline. They cancelled our flight out of Rome and replaced it with one leaving 4 hours later and arriving at IST 2 hours after our connecting flight to JFK left. The funny thing is that on the phone and at the Rome airport the reps I spoke to kept reassuring us that we will be able to catch our flight anyway. Of course they were not being truthful and we missed our flight and were put in a hotel. We had to pay Turkish entry visas. But the worst came when they made pre-arrangement with the hotel for our food. They did not give any voucher but pre-ordered a dish (same for everybody) consisting in a bowl of some kind of soup a fistful of rice with a piece of unidentified meat on top and no dring (not even water) allowed. They had no consideration for people's choice or diet preferences. You may get lucky but you may also dearly regret flying with them.,Detractor

I'm a frequent traveler hopping on planes every couple of weeks for U.S. domestic and European travel and my recent experience flying Turkish Airlines from Istanbul to JFK is the worst flight experience I have had. It started with not being able to contact the airline on the day of the flight to confirm the flight time on March 30th a day that Europe moved to daylight saving time but the Turkish government for some odd reason decided to delay the switch for twenty-four hours at the last minute. Next a surly person at the Turkish Airline check-in counter followed by a lengthy delay for takeoff due to the computer-automated baggage system being down. On the flight my travel companion and I were separated by the flight crew to accommodate a family that wanted to be seated together. We repeatedly told them we were traveling together he was moved to economy plus/business with plenty of seats around him but they refused to move me. So on an eleven-hour flight I ended up with no one to chat with. Finally the plane was full of toddlers and clearly the flight crew was having difficulty keeping the bathrooms clean and the cabin ended up smelling awful for the last 2 to 3 hours of the flight. On pulling out my laptop to do some work I discovered there was not enough room with the seat in front of me to actually open the laptop fully.,Detractor

TK1980 (14/3/2014) and 1985 (31/3/2014). Flights both outward and in were nightmares. For economy passengers the cabin seats food etc were fine. The cabin crew onboard were courteous enough. Onboard entertainment on outward flight was fine. The connecting flights were the ones that caused problems. On our outward journey there was only one hour allowed for us to get to the connecting flight from Istanbul to Dhaka. This one hour is too little. I am 71 years old and I was made to run behind the porter who was young and strong and was running and pushing my wife in a wheelchair through various check points to get us to the connecting flights on time. On the way back it was even worse. This time the time allowed for changeover at Istanbul was 1.5 hrs. The plane arrived late and after a very long wait the plane eventually stopped on one part of the runway. Passengers were bussed away and then the marathon began for them to get to the terminal for connecting flights. Same again running behind the porter pushing and running with my wife in the wheelchair. He managed to get us to the plane but just.

Johannesburg to Istanbul on 3rd April 2014 flight TK 41. The flight was full yet flight attendants graciously attended to each passenger. They smiled and were extremely polite which is something that seems to be lacking across a number of airlines.

Chose the airline due to recommendation and price. Went from Gatwick to Kuala Lumpur via Istanbul experienced a long delay on the outward leg at Istanbul but otherwise flights were on time.

We boarded a flight from Edin to Istanbul on 23/3/14. The cabin was rather small (seating of 2 and 3) and the air- conditioning was rather warm! Seats can be rather cramped if you are on the plus size. No negative comments about the food though. However Istanbul airport was chaotic. Going through passport control took us a good one hour. The next leg of our flight was Istanbul -Kuala Lumpur on a much bigger plane. Again the food was satisfactory. Service was ok and inflight entertainment featured some of the latest movies. Nevertheless the cabin temperature was a bit warm. We got a good deal on the tickets (1900 pounds for 5 pax) so I guess I shouldn't complain much.,Passive
All 4 flights reasonably good (Vienna-Male and back via Istanbul) however mostly unfriendly crew and delays of 2 of 4 flights. The delay as such was not too bad but the frustrating thing was that the pilots gave no information at all to the passengers. Imagine a delay of 1 hour and you sit in the plane and get no information about reason/extent of delay despite begging flight attendants for information. Pilots just did not care about passengers hope it is not the culture of Turkish Airlines. And there are two extremes: no announcements with regard to flight delay but otherwise so many announcements of useless information that passengers really got irritated. I'm sure Turkish Airlines is quite high in the ratio of announcement time versus flying time. Would be good if they reduce the announcement to the extent of other airlines. Please announce/talk less to passengers!,Detractor
IST-KTM. Flight was delayed 2.5 hours. No staff at the gate to provide information.

I flew in business class from Zurich to Johannesburg and back via Istanbul with Turkish Airlines. Their business class product for short haul was by far the best business class I have experienced in Europe. The crew were friendly and efficient the seat pitch was good and the food was absolutely great. The lounge in Istanbul is one of the nicest business class lounges I have been in. The long-haul sector to Johannesburg and back was also great. OK the seat and the inflight entertainment and not the most modern but they were well within acceptable bounds. Once again flight crews were friendly and efficient. No problems at any time with ground services. No delays and bags all delivered promptly and in good shape.,Promoter
IST-JIB with return. Both sectors brand new A321 with very good IFE. Food always above standards and plenty of soft drinks (no spirits on these flights). Cabin crew very attentive. The outbound leg arrived 30 minutes early. However the return had a delay of 30 minutes and I had a connection flight to catch (1h 30 min). This is the biggest issue with THY. Ground handling in IST. Although they were informed they did nothing. Long bus ride and then the chaotic security control of IST airport. The only reason that I didn't miss the next flight was a 20 minute delay. As far as it goes for value for money.,Promoter
My husband I are seasoned travellers. We travelled to Kathmandu from the UK via Birmingham and back again with a 3 day stop over in Istanbul. On our journey back we missed our flight due to a faulty flight display system which did not show that the plane was boarding and a public announcement system which did not announce the flight. The staff on the ground were rude discourteous and unhelpful. It took the airport staff to help us. Much needs to be done to improve services.,Detractor
I flew TK1939 (IST-BRU) in an Airbus 321. I had forgotten how pleasant flying economy class could be after all those hated Ryanair flights. Every seat has a personal screen with loads of movies to chose from. Fortunately the 3 hour flight gave me enough time to watch a full movie. Food was delicious. They even brought a menu with a choice of two plates. Wine was free. There even was a cook (complete with a cook hat). I know -it's just a flight attendant dressed differently but I bought it. Being a Gold elite member at Star Alliance I had access to the Turkish Airlines lounge before the flight. Truly wonderful. Spacious a great buffet and even a golf simulator to kill time. From now on I will use Turkish Airlines for all my flights to Asia avoiding Lufthansa and Frankfurt or Munich!,Promoter
I flew on flight #8 from IAD to IST and was quite impressed food was very good entertainment could be better but I guess it is enough to get by. Service is good however you might encounter a little attitude at times from the flight attendants. The departure back to IAD on flight #7 was also quite nice with some attitude problems from some flight attendants. Departure from IST is a bit disorganised you have to go trough a lot of security to board that flight to DC in Istanbul. I would fly this way again to go to Europe my final destination was Zurich Switzerland and those flights were great and on time.,Promoter
Dubai to Barcelona via Istanbul (Flight TK 0761 and TK1853 IST - Barcelona) on 15th March 2014. Flight delayed from Dubai however we arrived 50 minutes prior to departure of Barcelona flight.

DXB-IST 24th Jan TK 0761. IST-HBE 25th Jan TK 0696. I was lured to this airline by their extensive advertising I wish they saved the costs of advertising to improve their equipment and services. I paid for business class and I didn't even get anything near decent economy standard. The plane was old. The seats were in a very bad state. Boarding was chaotic. The second flight was on 25th Jan IST-HBE. Although I paid for a business class seat all I got was an economy seat at the front of the plane.,Detractor

I am back from my recent trip to Nepal and I have to say this has been the worst trip I had taken so far. Return trip from Kathmandu to Istanbul was delayed 6 hours thereby missing my connecting flight to USA. They re-routed me through Canada the next day and my baggage was left in Istanbul. Turkish ground staff were inefficient most do not seem to know what they were doing and keep you waiting for hours.,Detractor
BCN-IST-LJU in economy 7 March 2014. One of the better flights on Turkish. What bothers me is the inconstancy of service staff and maintenance of flight. 1 good flight out of 10. I always select a seat when booking but somehow when I check in TK always change the seat. As a Gold member I am not able to select exit rows either not even at online check-in. On both flights I was comfortable however having an aisle seat the middle sear next to me was empty the cabin was not hot at this time and the service was rather good. We were however delayed out of IST for more than 20 mins. but arrived 5 mins late to LJU. I will not fly Turkish for another year let's see if they get better.,Passive
London-Istanbul-Beijing Economy class. I have to say this is the best economy class I have experienced. For both segments Turkish delights are served immediately after takeoff the food is completely at different classes against other European airlines juice was freshly squeeze orange juice. For the long haul flight we were given slippers ear phones toothbrush and toothpaste and so on which you do not expect in economy class. However the drawback is the geography of Turkey has made the flight much longer and the staff in the Istanbul airport are absolute nightmare although they are not the faults of the airline. However I have worries about passenger behaviour once the aircraft has touched down people are standing up and collecting their luggage from the overhead storage this is the case whether the aircraft is either still on or just leaving the main landing ways. I feel sorry for the cabin crews as there are just so many people and there are little things the crews could do about it.,Promoter
LGW to CPT - 27/28 February in Economy. Both planes very full. Easy boarding in London - less so in Istanbul where it was necessary to board a coach to go to the plane. Seats on both were comfortable and inflight entertainment good. Food excellent - special meal provided as requested. Staff very helpful on board and good amenity kit. Highly recommended especially if you can get a promotional fare. Security check on transfer at Istanbul simplified and no lines.,Promoter
Copenhagen-Istanbul-Kathmandu on 18th February and back on 24th and that was not a good experience. On the flight from Istanbul to Kathmandu the plane was old and shabby with very little space the lights at the seats did not work so the light was on in the cabin all night there were no screens in front of the seats and no entertainment not even information on the flight on the small communal screens. Nobody served water or anything during the night dinner was OK but meagre and as a vegetarian I got only half the food of those who had ordered meat. I asked for more but the staff member never came back with it. The flight could not land in Kathmandu due to fog. We were 5 hours late with an extra landing in New Delhi with no food or drink and arrived 5 hours late with no offer of compensation. On the way back again more than 5 hours delay without information as to why as we arrived in Istanbul it took ages to get tickets for a meal in the airport and when we got them we could only use them in the fast food restaurants in the food court and had to pay ourselves if we wanted to sit in a decent place. All together not to be recommended - and on top of it all the staff was not very friendly and informative.,Detractor
27 Feb TK 211 Antalya-Moscow economy. Aircraft was old 320 at the airport before departure no proper explanation given for almost one hour delay - apparently caused by malfunctioning of emergency door. The food was excellent staff friendly although it was a midnight flight. Return was 3 March Moscow-Istanbul daytime flight TK 414 economy. Brand new 321 with comfortable leg space. The food was excellent. IFE was very good with latest movies and a lot of variety. The cabin crew were friendly. Smooth take off and to Istanbul smooth landing.

Business from IST-JFK JFK-IST with 3 family members staff horrible both flights didn't do proper pre-flight service service was poor. Staff not attentive to passengers especially for a business level flight. Baggage was last out even being tagged priority on first leg the return flight baggage was lost.

Over priced as well usually double the fare for a 1 stop business flight compared to other airlines like British KLM or Lufthansa.,Detractor
HEL-IST-BOM return on A320 B777 and A321. Last trip on TK was few years back and since many fellow travellers on this forum have suggested TK to be inconsistent nowadays we didn't expect anything really. TK turned out to be very good on all four sectors: all flights on time or ahead of schedule all aircraft quite new with great legroom and good IFE that had many interesting options. Moreover the hot meals by DO&CO were of high quality compared to any big European competitor - I still prefer proper food on flights over 3 hrs instead of a sandwich if a meal is served. Human interaction is always a matter of personal taste: for us the cabin crews on these full flights were perfectly fine with good command of English - plus many smiles all the way. All in all TK was very comfortable and great value really.,Promoter
We chose the airline for the good price they have in Business Class and also for the fantastic lounge in Istanbul. The hard product on long distance planes are great but the 737 and 320 that we flew ARN-IST with is just normal economy seats with blocked middle seat. The food is good but the service level is low. Priority boarding is a big no. Everyone is let onboard straight away. The Cabin Crew hardly says hello as you enter the aircraft and dinner service is slow. A smile is very unusual on Turkish. So pay for a good seat (on long distance flights) ok food onboard and a good lounge in Istanbul. Service level is very low. Also if you book early you can get a really good price even in Business class.,Passive
Flight from CPT-IST-CPH. Turkish airlines has a top of the range product (if one were to exclude their customer service). Their planes are very up to date modern interior fantastic food great lie flat seats and generous sized IFE with a wide selection of films. The CIP lounge in IST was also very very good! Customer service has ample room for improvement. Perhaps its a cultural thing but I didn't find the cabin crew nor the staff in the lounge particularly forthcoming. In fact they were all quite arrogant individuals which appeared to hate their jobs. Nevertheless I will fly with them again - just don't be expected to be treated like royalty.,Promoter
TK 1637 IST-MUC. Going back home from Iran I had to change planes in IST. This was a very bad experience you had to go through security control and I had only a limited time for connection. It was overcrowded and disorganized. We started with delays because of disorganization. They checked whether everybody had a visa or permission to go to a Schengen country. Why did they not check it when getting the boarding pass. Entering the plane very unfriendly crew. They served everything without smiles not speaking English? Like always theoretically the choice of two meals but on reaching row # 18 there was no longer a choice. Only one kind of meal left. Happily it was the meal of my choice.,Detractor
Flew JFK-BOM and return with stopover in IST on my way back. First served a little Turkish Delight (Lokum) which was quite nice. This was followed by drinks and meal. JFK-IST served 2 meals and IST-BOM had one. Leg room for economy was pretty much what I expected. IFE was quite good. New movies shows and free WIFI which was of course slow but worked. They also have USB media so you could just snap your flash drive and it will play the songs / media on it. I have travelled on Cathay Qatar and Emirates and while they do have the USB slot it wouldn't play media but this one did. Staff were courteous and polite. The IST-JFK sector had many vacant seats in Comfort class but they wanted 260 Euros which I didn't got for. Paid less than $900 for the round trip with the stopover so it was a good value.,Passive
Istanbul - Munich - Istanbul 10 January 2014. A very comfortable and enjoyable flight both in Business Class. The staff were friendly and helpful. The planes were both Airbus A321.

The Entertainment with films and music channels were interesting. Before take off and before landing given hot towels to all business class guests. Value for money is very excellent.,Promoter

HAM-IST-AYT-IST-HAM: Once onboard we were greeted by courteous staff. Before takeoff they served Turkish Delight in economy class which is something never to be seen on any other European airlines. They even arranged my vegetarian meal from business class as it was not loaded. TK serves fresh orange juice and lemonade which is perhaps the best drink I have had on onboard! Meals are always tasty and crew are friendly and helpful although I have to say that Chef-onboard service is absolutely useless. Chef did not even know what the vegetarian meal was on TK flights but thanks to the crew who got me something to eat although it came an hour after the service. The legspace is acceptable and much better than Air Berlin and Lufthansa though one of their aircraft's was so old that I could hold the seat cushion. All in all it was a pleasant experience. How I wish they performed with same service on Non EU routes.,Promoter
I flew with Turkish in January in C-Class Vienna-Istanbul-Bangkok and Singapore-Istanbul-Vienna. Its true that they offer good amounts of food but the quality was poor on all these sectors. Completely tasteless meals served by flight attendants that did not smile at all and did not understand English. The cabins of the long sectors IST- BKK and SIN-IST were also quite dirty. The most disappointing thing was that the crews on all the sectors were not very friendly. Austrian Airlines also have Do&Co as their caterer but between Austrian and Turkish there is a big difference.,Detractor
Flew from Vilnius to Dubai. Plane from Vilnius to Istanbul was great and comfortable yet got very old A330 from Istanbul to Dubai. Service is great price is ok too. Yet I wish they would make at least a few seats for people taller then 180cm. I'm 189cm and I absolutely hate Airbus seats as their head rest is pointing at my shoulders.

JNB-IST-WAW 13 and 14th Feb. Flights on time. Metal was A330 and A321 respectively. The long haul was excellent with many food and drink choices. Wines from 4-5 continents ranging from rose champagne red and whites selected from within a wide range just to my taste. FA attendants were frequent and respectful. IFE maybe the best I've seen and easy to operate. Huge monitors. Bed not fully lie flat so I actually turned around and laid my head on the stool and slept better with my legs in slight upward position. Night-kit given was boring and superfluous. Check-in at transit in JNB only possible 3 hours prior to departure. However was allowed through security without boarding cards as to kill time in the SAA-lounges. When the check in lady eventually appeared at transit she was professional and kind and managed even to trace my luggage and give it an additional (needed) label so I could transfer it throughout. The corresponding luggage receipt was smoothly given to me as I entered the stairs boarding the aircraft. The lounge in IST was extended with a huge under-deck 3 days ago and is a world-class positive experience in design space beauty and service provided. IST-WAW on Airbus 321-200. Not business class seat but ordinary economy with tabled middle seat to increase space in the 3x3 configuration. IFE on small ceiling monitors were useless. Staff were alert and kind. As usual for TK one was dressed up pretending to be a cook despite we were only 4 pax in business out of 12 possible. Food very good varied and wide options inc. of individual cheese plates deserts etc. Even champagne was offered on this European flight of a duration of only 2+ hours.,Promoter
HEL-IST-TLV 19 Feb. Fog in IST kept us delayed in HEL for 3 hours. Updates from gate agents left much to be desired. 45 minutes circling the foggy airport not a nice feeling but eventually landed safely. Next flight to TLV delayed 4 hours. No gate personnel present until boarding. No amenities offered. HEL-IST A319 with no IFE at all. Crew friendly and nice meal/bar service. Generous with alcohol. IST-TLV A321 with IFE at every seat. Leg room a disaster compared to other TK a/c. Again all female crew friendly nice food. I also noticed that on all 4 flights the aircraft's were never air-conditioned. It meant sitting in a very warm stuffy and crowded plane until they were ready to go. Not a very welcoming environment. All in all good service. Will fly again.,Promoter
AMS-IST: I was on the wing. This section has to do with 1 less FA than in the back. My warm meal arrived cold. KIX-IST: Like on the outbound flight a sense of disorganization during 1st meal service. One FA was running back and forth. Good on-time performance.,Passive
TLV-IST-HEL. TLV to IST B737-800 great leg room leather seats no personal IFE. The crew were nice handed out heart shaped chocolates for Valentines Day. They managed to serve breakfast on this short flight and a bar service. The only bad remark cabin very hot during boarding terrible welcome. It got better as we took off. Remote parking in IST bussed to terminal. Security much quicker than expected. Departure area crowded and stuffy as usual. Again boarded A321 steaming hot. This time legroom was atrocious could not move or eat? The B737-800 felt like business class compared to this torture. Crew friendly and hard working full hot meal service wine beer and alcohol were free. This time personal IFE. Product seems inconsistent. All in all a positive experience.,Promoter

IST-EZE GRU-IST Economy. I am a frequent flyer with TK (Elite) and there are many things I like about TK but the biggest problem of this airline is consistency. Some flights are excellent while others are just a horrible experience. This happened with my flights to EZE and back from GRU. The plane on both legs was awful. Under each seat there is a big metal box which makes it unbearable in combination with the tight legroom. Overall the plane seemed old and not taken care of. It had not been cleaned properly before departure. The staff were not attentive forgetting my requests. On the return flight there was no menu no hot towel no fresh orange juice. The temperature during the flight - freezing. The lounge in GRU is a joke. The good TAM lounge is closed at night and they use the Smiles lounge which is simply not acceptable. Ground handling poor - my priority has not been recognized at baggage delivery and for the return flight the check in staff didn't attach the priority label at all. All in all if I only took this one flight and judged TK based on this experience I would definitely not recommend this airline.,Detractor
9th Feb TK70. We purchased our tickets from London to Istanbul and then from Istanbul on to Hong Kong almost as soon as they were released 11 months before we were due to travel. Perhaps because we booked through an online travel agent we were not offered seat selection at that point. We didn't worry too much because we assumed that the airlines default position would be to sit a couple together and after all we had booked very early. This turned out to be a naive assumption! When we attempted to check in online which was more than 36 hours before the Istanbul to Hong Kong flight the only seats available were at opposite ends of the cabin. Our pleas to the Turkish airlines office in London the check in desk at Gatwick and the transfer desk at Istanbul were all to no avail. This completely ruined the flight for me whilst I respect that the airline couldn't bump someone from a pre booked seat we should have been sat together by default at point of booking.,Detractor

Flew CPH-IST-Bombay mid December 2013. One more good experience with THY all flights on time and service as expected good. No other European carrier serves this amount of meals on intraeuropean flights and service about the same on intercontinental. As a regular flyer on THY in recent years I would recommend changing the meals a little - on all 4 flights food was the same as before always delicious but perhaps a little tired compared to some years ago. Beverage service excellent and although staff of THY are not very smiley they were effective. Inflight entertainment good with good selection of movies both older and recently published. Transfer in IST chaotic on way out very smooth on return flight. Again I can recommend THY for both service costs and extensive route network.,Promoter

DHK-IST then IST-JFK. This was my first time with Turkish airline. Cabin staff were rude. On my first leg I ordered a glass of water twice but it never came I had to walk to the galley to get my glass of water. The food was served after 1 hour. It was an 8.5 hrs flight so me and my wife slept a bit after the meal was done. I took beef biriyani and my wife took grilled chicken. The chicken was really tasty unfortunately I choose the wrong meal. Then before landing we were served a sandwich which was good. On our 2nd leg IST to JFK (10 hrs 30 mins) it was an early morning flight which was supposed to take off at 7.30 but got delayed 45 minutes. First meal (scrambled egg with mushroom) was served immediately after take off which was tasty but the cabin crews were again disappointing. Again I ordered a cocktail but it didn't come the first time I asked for it. I would recommend this flight as its cheap.,Passive
Flew from Manchester to Dhaka (14th January) return Dhaka to London (11th January). Completely mixed bag experience when comparing the outbound and return journeys. The outbound was 10 out 10 due to punctuality professionalism amenities etc. I took advantage of the free Istanbul Tour offered by the Turkish Airlines. For the return leg the flight was delayed by 7.5 hours due to foggy conditions at Dhaka which obviously is not Turkish's fault. I was put on a different connecting flight to London which was supposed to depart within 1 hour of the arrival of the Dhaka flight to Istanbul. However the flight took 8.5 hours instead of 7 hours which meant that I missed the London flight. But what made this experience worse is the lack of in-flight entertainment system on this 8.5 hour flight. If Turkish is to compete with the other Airlines (Emirates Qatar Etihad) flying to Dhaka it has to take the Istanbul-Dhaka-Istanbul route seriously and ensure consistency across the flights.,Passive
LHR-IST-SCQ via BIO. I pre-reserved seats which were not respected even being Elite+ passenger on TK. Check in at LHR was very regular not giving a decent service. I was not advised about the seats and lounge options. Flight LHR-IST departed on time and was full. Fight was so hot! A321 was dirty and old. The cabin crew served the meal and drinks and disappeared for the entire flight. My headphones stopped working in the middle of the movie and even changing them did not help. Staff did not do anything to help. My next flight to Santiago via Bilbao was as bad as the first one. No movie available. Only one service available during 6 hrs of the flight. The last leg BIO- SCQ did not have any service. All in all not a good experience and for the price paid I would never repeat!,Detractor
NRT - Istanbul - Barcelona. Plenty of food and snacks on the long haul flight - I love how they give out Turkish Delights just after take off and a meal menu on all flights. The only complaint was the friendliness of the crew who always looked grumpy and a few were falling asleep at their crew seats during taking off and landing on both sectors. Once they completed their meal service they disappeared and were chatting non stop at the back of the plane with other crew. Other than this a good 2 sectors with TK.,Passive
Geneva - Istanbul TK1918 19 Dec 2013. Istanbul - Dhaka 19 Dec 2013 TK0712. Dhaka - Istanbul 9 Jan 2014. Istanbul - Geneva 10 Jan 2014. No inflight entertainment on flight from Istanbul to Dhaka or from Dhaka to Istanbul. On January 9 flight from Dhaka to Istanbul was delayed 7 hours due to fog. When the flight finally took off on 9 Jan flight time from Dhaka to Istanbul (non-stop) was 8.5 hours due a ridiculously old plane being used. I was informed in Dhaka on 9 Jan that I would miss my connecting flight to Geneva and would have to travel the next morning and was thus issued a boarding pass for the next day. When we arrived in Istanbul no instructions were given by the cabin crew leaving passengers to figure things out on their own. It took another 2.5 hours for ground staff to issue us hotel vouchers. Some toilets were non-functional on the flight from Istanbul to Dhaka on 19 December. All crew members on the flight from Istanbul to Dhaka and back appeared to be Turkish and spoke very basic English. Plus points: Staff of Turkish airlines in Dhaka were most professional and courteous and did their best to attend to the needs of passengers. Food was decent. Overall - a very lousy experience. There is a major difference in the quality of service (old planes no in-flight entertainment rude/unprofessional service) on the flight to/from Dhaka-Istanbul compared to flights to/from Istanbul-Geneva.,Detractor

"JFK-Istanbul-Bangkok. While the crew were not overwhelmingly friendly they did their jobs efficiently and mostly with smiles. What sets Turkish Airlines apart besides their phenomenal lounge at the Istanbul Airport is the quality and quantity of the food that they serve on board. Whereas on most other airlines you get a choice of perhaps 3 different appetizers to choose from on Turkish Airlines they have a whole trolley filled with different Turkish appetizers from you to select. You can try as many as you want. The same logic holds true for desserts. You had perhaps 10 different options to choose from. The seats on both flights were not of the ""lie flat"" variety but were comfortable nonetheless. My only true complaint dealt with the cabin temperature. The crew kept the temperature fairly warm on both flights. I did ask one of the attendants to lower the temperature on the flight to Istanbul which she did. But in about an hour or two later the temperature was warm again. Offerings in the amenity kits provided were generous and the cabins and rest rooms were kept fairly clean throughout both flights. Lastly it really is a bit comical to see one or two of the flight attendants dressed up as chefs given that none of the food is prepared on board.",Promoter
TK 713 Dhaka - Istanbul Dec 13 2013 and TK 712 Istanbul - Dhaka Jan 9 2014. The airline is turning from slight above average to a complete disaster on their Dhaka bound flights. Now they are using their oldest A330-203 with no inflight entertainment at all. Seats are sometimes broken. Even the last resort of comfort the reading lights are not working or wrongly wired and therefore useless or really annoying. FAs are trying to cope with it but you can see that it even annoys them to work on a plane like this. They will even wake you up in the middle of the night to serve breakfast when everybody was sleeping. When I got shook awake despite having a sleeping mask on and questioned them they said it is normal for them to serve at this time as it was morning in Istanbul (5 hours away). Dhaka is not an easy destination but Turkish is doing everything to make it the worst for the average passenger. In winter when there is morning fog in Dhaka Turkish is the only carrier that does not dare to change their flight schedule like Emirates or Qatar but prefers to have their flights delayed by 5 hours without prior notification. It had now happened 3 times travelling from Dhaka or Istanbul. Only positive thing is the quality of the food which is usually good and tasty and drinks policy. Nevertheless this was my last flight with them after I was a loyal traveller due to affordable price.,Detractor
BKK-SGN. Very disappointed upon a first good impression that did not last: Aircraft 777-300 were old and worn. Staff pretend to be kind but were just assuming they could speak English. Basically no food on board and a very very poor cold sandwiched was made from remnants from the previous leg flown. Horrible. The 2 staff dressed as cooks were a joke: apart from clothes not clean they were just pretending and no foods were ever cooked or made for the flight. Could not get additional food. They told me that the cheese was spoiled by heat from the previous trip. An FA agreed to offer me anyway but never came to me again. The mayonnaise in the sandwich were not good and too much. After hard negotiations got a glass of champagne but no info of provenance. Menu cards were wishful thinking. Seats worn and torn arranged in herring pattern poorly arranged and most provided no view. No earphones provided. No travel kit no magazines no papers nothing of anything! Seat pockets were empty except for air-sick bags and safety/emergency info card. Staff kept away from cabin as they had nothing to offer. At least they admitted that they had ran short of supplies. We were then forced seated as they announced we were to land soon. That gave them excuse for further denials of drinks and snacks and food. I was allowed to try their ancient 1st class and was impressed by the very old design and spacious cabin with 4 windows at a seat. The cabin was closed for service however as only business class is sold. Give only score 3 out of 10: two for being on time and one for an FA for being honest enough to admit food crises on board.,Detractor
KTM-IST-LHR 28/12/2013. A330-300 flight from KTM was delayed around 5 hours. Not much information given apart from aircraft was circling above probably due to fog but other flights although smaller jets landed up to 2 hours earlier. On board aircraft had no personal screens and on take off the Captain announced there would be no IFE with no reason given. Transit at IST should have been 6 hours but due to the delay we had a 1 hour transfer so a rush to the departure gate. Flight to LHR arrived a half hour early but checked in baggage was left in IST.

On Jan 17th we went from DXB to IST. This flight was awful. Normally they have quite a lot space in economy class but not in this Boeing we really had to squeeze ourselves between the seat rows! Also they had no control over the hand luggage. Passengers came with really large bags and cases which that were not at all suitable to be stored in the cabin. When the lockers were full some passengers started arguing. This was chaos! Until this point we had always been satisfied with THY but this time we were disappointed. The connecting flight from IST to LEJ as well as the onward flights some days ago were much better.,Detractor

LHR-IST-LHR over the Christmas - We use this airline regularly as they offer a good choice of flights from London with convenient departure times and have always been impressed with the quality of inflight service. B777-300 in both directions - aircraft was very clean and looked reasonably new. Very tasty meals were served in both directions and the Turkish Delight shortly after take-off is a nice touch. Good choice of drinks offered with the meal although it's true to say that they don't regularly pass through the cabin with the drinks trolley (to be honest there aren't many airlines that do these days - especially in economy) all you have to do is ask and they will serve you with a smile! The AVOD offered a good choice of TV and movies - the 4h flight passed very quickly. It's worth remembering however that some of the flights from London use smaller B737 or A320 family aircraft and may not have personal TVs in economy. The 11.40 and 16.10 flights from LHR generally use A330s / 777s. We have flown on smaller planes and the service is fine but not quite as much legroom as on the 777. Overall the flights were very comfortable with good in-flight service and compare favourably with many Western European airlines that I have flown on and have no hesitation in recommending them.,Promoter
LHR-IST round trip. I decided to choose schedule based on flying on the 777-300 (Jet Airways lease). Chose row 33 out 31 back. Complimentary drinks served quickly followed by offer of a Turkish delight and then a full meal service. Choice of chicken or beef dish same on return journey but still good quality for an economy flight. Cabin crew efficient not really service with a smile however. Seat back on demand films games etc. to pass the time. Both flights spot on time with bags off quickly.,Passive
IST-IKA 28th Dec 2013. I arrived from MUC going to IKA. Finally one hour delayed we entered the plane. Crew were very unfriendly without taking any notice of us. Shortly after take-off we got Turkish delights. Then it took a very long time before we got our meal. According to the menu you had the choice of two meals but when they reached my row no choice and a very cold meal. On the A321 you had theoretically inflight entertainment. The menu of the display was in Turkish English German French Arabic but only the menu. The movies etc. were only in Turkish. Summary: Delayed bad service cold meals unfriendly staff chaotic situation at the airport in Istanbul.,Detractor

Flew Turkish Airlines for the first time in December Business Class from Dhaka to Vienna return Paris to Dhaka. We were disappointed in a number of things. There was no entertainment service (out of order both ways) and the attendants while not unpleasant were more interested in chatting than serving. The food was excellent and the beds OK. The rap highlight however was the Istanbul lounge which must be amongst the best in the world. Fabulous food and services.,Passive
On 5th Jan 2014 flew Business class from Manchester to Bangkok via Istanbul. The trip was disappointing in that we flew on different planes than we were advised when booking the flight from Manchester to Istanbul was supposed to be on a 737-900 but was in fact on an old 321 and the flight from Istanbul to Bangkok was supposed to be on a 777 but in fact was on an old 340. However what was good about the flights was the excellent service of the cabin crews and the quality of food and beverage both of which were of the highest order and could not be faulted.,Passive

18/12/2013 Luxembourg-Istanbul TK1354. 19/12/2013 Istanbul-Jakarta TK66. 4/1/2014 Kuala Lumpur-Istanbul TK61. 5/1/2014 Istanbul-Luxembourg TK1353. Staff on various flights were impolite to even rude. A vegetarian meal was ordered and served but turned out to contain meat. After enquiring they simply took back the meal and served a new one without saying a single word. No apology - nothing. Other questions were answered with grimaces only not words. Safety instructions from staff before landing sound more like army orders. The media box in their A340 takes half of the foot space absolutely inconvenient on long distance. The inflight entertainment doesn't contain new releases only old movies. The schedule as per magazine doesn't comply with the entertainment system. Furthermore very limited language options on some flights only. The food was very good on one flight average on 2 and un-enjoyable on the 4th flight. Journey time was quite long. Website looks antiquated not possible to order special meal only by phone. Online check-in not possible for some origins but they tell you only after all data like passport number date of birth has been entered already. The transfer in their Istanbul hub is horrible. One has to queue for transfer safety check for hours. All in all the second worst airline I have flown with.,Detractor
Flew GVA-IST-AUH. Seats were dirty and could hardly be reclined footrest is a joke. On both legs staff rushed through the meal to the point where my husband had to physically hold on to his tray (IST-AUH). Staff not very friendly no greeting during boarding and an unapproachable attitude during the flights seats in front of us were used by cabin crew to sleep during the flight between IST-AUH. Entertainment system was poor compared to what other airlines have to offer. On both flights the toilet was smelly and did not feel clean. Not looking forward to our return flights nor the changing of planes in Istanbul we will avoid them in the future.,Detractor

Although seats are very good there are severe limitations: Istanbul Airport offers no extra tracks for Business class passengers which means that you have to line up with all the others in the middle of the night/early in the morning (usually) to pass the overcrowded security checks. There is a fast track lane but it was always closed when I needed to pass it (4 times in the past 2 months). Istanbul airport is deplorable not coping with the rapid expansion of TK. This means that your expensive Business class experiences finds a rather unpleasant middle piece. Even more disturbing is the very wrong catering service concept and staff quality. Usually one pays for an expensive business class seat to find rest and piece and some sleep. TK assumes that you are in it for the culinary experience and serve food regardless of the flying time thus limiting the rest time severely. For instance while flying from Istanbul to Cape Town TK started serving dinner at midnight for over 3 hours. Then they wake you up 2 hours before landing to serve breakfast. Even worse is that the crew is serving and removing the food very noisily moving plates glasses etc for hours. The 11 hours flight to Cape Town thus had only 3 hours of quite sleeping time. Worst affected are the first and last rows of the business class being close to the pantry. Another bad example was the flight from Istanbul to Doha: here same procedure: although guests wanted to sleep right after the take-off (midnight again). Food was served almost the entire flight (4 hours). Noise was unbearable as the pantry did not even had a shielding curtain. Besides the fact that the food is nothing special the quality of the crews is very heterogeneous. During the flight to Doha the chief cabin attendant was reading the newspaper drank tea in front of the business class passengers (no curtain) and was observing leisurely the work of his subordinates. The staff chats constantly with each other and although there are more than enough attendants on board it is not possible to place a successful request as the chain of command is long and unclear responsibilities seem to exist.,Detractor
Extremely pleasant flight. Despite all weather issues our flight took off and landed on time in Toronto. In- flight free wi-fi is definitely the best. The meals were so tasty and fresh.

I have nothing but praise for this great airline. Meals provided and drinks included. They have always left on time. They are great value for money.

September 2013 on a return trip from New Delhi to Istanbul. The plane food service were all way below what I expected the plane was so old I was surprised it was still in service. I took a return trip from New Delhi to Rome - via Istanbul. At that time I raved to friends about the quality of the plane flight everything. I was shocked when my experience this year was so bad. Staff didn't want to be on the plane it was so bad. I would like to try Turkish Airlines again when I travel in September this year - how do I know whether I get a good plane or a bad one. I have said I would recommend the airline again because my first experience was so good - would advise people to be cautious though.,Detractor
DUS-IST-KUL and return in Economy. DUS-IST and IST-DUS by A320/321. Very crowded and the cabin crew didn't bring discipline into boarding deboarding and inflight behavior. All natural chaos with people standing/talking while fasten seatbelt-sign was shown passengers with much more than 1 piece of (bulky) hand luggage children without seats pax standing up just after touching the runway - nobody seems to care. Experienced cabin crew checked seat belts with loud and clear announcements from the flight deck - in Turkish and English. In addition: excellent catering (outgoing IST) by DoCo.

PTV's on A321 ok but on A320 not at all not even on the roof! Finally we had to wait about 4 hours both inbound and outbound in a chaotic transit in Istanbul with not even one chair to sit on.

Transfer in IST was horrific - poor signs and the transit for VIP passengers is not highlighted so easy to miss. Miles of walking and it looked like a building site. The lounge was simply overcrowded and staff at reception had an ""I don't care attitude"". Onward flight boarded early no separate line for business class and departed on time.

This is a shame as the product could in principle be very good but we'll not fly TK again.",Passive
Business class LGW-IST-BKK / BKK-IST-LHR. Having read several reviews particularly around the level of business class service we were somewhat apprehensive prior to travelling. In the event we found the overall product to be high quality and at an operational level all flights departed on time and allowed connections to be made easily. It is true that its down to you to request drinks throughout the flight but requests were met in a friendly way. In fact there was certainly no lack of friendliness or smiles from the cabin crew unlike other reviews on this site. Comfort levels were great in the A330 flat bed sectors the London to IST sectors on the A321 compare very favourably to other carriers short haul business class. The lounge at IST is also to be highly commended although very busy (xmas). Overall we were very satisfied all round and would use them again and would recommend.,Promoter
Got a very cheap discount ticket from Milan (Italy) to Kuala Lumpur (Malaysia) and return. Each sector was on time and operated by an aircraft with decent legroom. Meals on board were excellent more bistro than airline food! Transiting at Istanbul airport is as painful as getting through packed Gulf hubs (as Doha and Abu Dhabi) but this is the unavoidable part of the journey! Just two cons: Most of cabin crew and ground staff at IST have really basic English skills. In Dec 2013 online check-in was not available at KL airport making the pre-flight experience a bit hectic.

IST to Gatwick London on 25th as a Gold member with other Star Alliance airlines they did not provide a priority baggage handling tag. Lounge at IST was excellent but far too busy at least 10 mins to find a seat and another 10 mins to queue for the foods. If you want to have a shower you may need to wait 90 mins. From London to Istanbul on 30th I was not allowed to use the lounge not allowed to increase check-in baggage allowance and could not check my bags to my final destination. When I re-checked my bags in Istanbul they would not check-in my bag again to Melbourne only to Singapore asked me to re-check them in Singapore. After I arrived in Singapore I checked with ground staff of Singapore airlines who helped me to re-direct my bags to Melbourne and I did not have to do it myself again. The cabin service with TK: staff very unfriendly and do not want to provide services at all. The toilet was disgusting. Only good thing about TK is that they provide a good travel kit.,Passive
The B737-800 used by Turkish airlines (IST-ISB) is completely unsuitable for a journey of over 4000km and lasting 5 hrs 35 mins. The seats are tiny and the leg room not great even for 5'10 person.

In December 2013 we flew from Istanbul to JFK - Flight 0003. We had previously flown from JFK to Istanbul a week earlier so we knew what to expect as far as seat comfort movie selection and meals. This time however the flight crew was very different from the last crew. It was obvious from the moment we walked on the plane that the crew was unfriendly and unprofessional. They seemed completely unconcerned for the well being of the passengers. We received a tiny cup of coffee at take off and did not get any more in the 11 hour flight! The beverage cart only came around when meals were served - twice! The bathroom went from clean to disgusting in about three hours and remained that way. It is very disappointing that such a good airline has terrible employees.,Passive
In December 2013 we flew from JFK to Istanbul Turkey then on to Rome Italy. Our flight was 0004. After reading some of the reviews for Turkish Airlines I was concerned about our trip.

Check in was east and efficient and all ground and all flight staff were highly professional and friendly. Flight from IST to ADD was on a smaller plane (B737) so the seats were not good but service was fine. The Istanbul airport is total chaos but the business lounge was huge and the food omnipresent.

The overall service is fair. I was booked in economy premium from Scotland to Turkey and then Turkey to Bangladesh. Although I collected my boarding pass for both parts of the journey from Edinburgh airport where I was allocated my chosen seat. On my trip to Bangladesh the cabin crew at the boarding gate had cut my seat number (12K) on the boarding gate with a pen and gave me seat at the very back of the plane.

Crew inattentive and impolite - when I pointed out that a toilet indicator light was also not functioning I was told that the light for another toilet was working.

The seats were a bit cramped could have more legroom. On African sectors brand new B 737-900ER were used. These planes are very comfortable leather seats with good legroom and big seatback screens with latest movies. I must say that they were nicest on-aisle planes I ever flown with. On all sectors the meal and drink service was very good cannot remember when I last could select my meals from menu card in economy class. The cabin service was professional and friendly. Some lack of cabin discipline though people were allowed to walk around and tray tables were used immediately after take-off. All flights arrived on-time and bags delivered.

MAN-IST-ICN. First time flying with Turkish Airlines. Booked my flights in June and travelled in December. Itinerary showed B739 and B773 but ended up flying in B738 and A340. The B738 was old and there was overhead screen for entertainment for MAN-IST a 4 hour flight. My seat's earphone plug-in was spoilt therefore inflight entertainment was as good as non-existed. IST-ICN flight entertainment was good but limited choices. Amenities were given on the IST-ICN flight which includes eye mask lip balm ear-plugs socks and slippers. The cabin was warm for some reason it was not like other airline's where the cabin would be cold. Food was tasty but not delicious. Service was average. Rarely notice any drink rounds on the 10 hour flight but they provided a bottle of water after meal. Witnessed a cabin crew just switched off a passenger's call button and walked away even before the passenger manage to speak. Overall Turkish Airlines was not as good as I expect from a top 10 airline.,Passive
Overall the flight from IST-IAH was very comfortable. The leg room and the comfort class seats were very comfortable.

FCO-IST-ADS-IST-BCN over a 4 day period early December. A320 or 737 aircraft - all in decent shape. Seat comfort is fine and on the 737s the leg room was larger then some premium economy flights I've been on. Where Turkish excels is the food - quality and quantity beat any airline hands-down and I've travelled on over a hundred airlines. Flight attendants were friendly and all spoke English well. On-time or within 10 minutes of schedule - Ataturk Airport is a mess and all flights arrived or departed via gate stand so dealing with buses to and from the planes gets annoying.

I recently has 2 horrible experiences with this airline on my DC-Istanbul-Mumbai and Mumbai-Istanbul-Chicago flights. On my flight from Washington DC-Istanbul I received sub standard service from one of the air hostesses. Even after 4 requests I did not get any headsets. I was served dinner late and without any bread. The air hostess plainly ignored my request for coffee.

"This was my first time on Turkish Airlines (Helsinki-Istanbul-Helsinki). The plane was ok I liked the leather seats and there was enough space for me. The seats seemed a bit ""worn out "" to me though. The plane could have been tidier I guess it had just brought passengers to Helsinki and there was only a little time to clean it. The toilets were much cleaner than on other airliners' planes which was nice. Food was really good and it felt luxurious to be able choose from two menus! They showed quite new movies during the flight but when we flew back to Helsinki there was no sound coming from the audio system. This problem affected all the passengers not just me. The flight attendant couldn't do anything about this problem. What really upset me was the cabin crew's attitude on safety matters. Flight attendants didn't care at all about the position of passengers' seats tray tables or hand luggage during take off and landing. It definitely didn't give a good impression of safety issues. I have also got used to cabin crew paying attention to seat belt sign during turbulent weather but they just let people move around and use toilets normally.",Passive

I had the vegetarian option and it was delicious but I also eyed other menu items and they looked great. Positive experience.",Promoter

IST-AMS A332. Friend and I were in the CIP lounge where the staff remind you to keep track of your own flight status. We had plenty of time arrived at the lounge 2.5hrs prior to departure. At 1.5hr prior to departure I went for a smoke and the flight status was not open. After 10mins when I returned the status was last call. This was a bus gate boarding and was really unsatisfactory. Beware of this. I would fly TK again but this was a terrible experience.,Detractor
IST-GVA-IST. No problems except the utterly uncomfortable seats and the heat in the airplane. Although it is a short flight sitting 3+ hours in the their A320 seats is a torture the pitch must have been adjusted by the millimetre to squeeze in one or two more rows. Seats are hard and although I am of average height my knees toughed the front seat. The crew were as previously experienced on THY dull and not particularly friendly. Smiles are rare unfortunately. I do sometimes take this flight as it is the only direct connection between GVA and IST the option is with LX via ZRH but although it takes more time flying with Swiss is way more comfortable and you have a friendly crew.,Detractor

I flew to Istanbul and back to Shanghai. On the first leg the flight was delayed 1 hour. When boarding was completed the flight was delayed another 40 mins due to air traffic control. I found a travel kit and slippers on the seat. Inflight wi-fi was not working. Food was quite good but no Chinese meal. Cabin crew worked very quickly and cleaned the toilets regularly. It was very cold in the cabin no one paid attention to it. On the way back the flight was on time. The other things were almost the same. Cabin crew and ground handling agents at Istanbul airport worked fast but did not seem to want to communicate with customers.,Passive
Whereas they claim to be Europe's best airline their ground services are appalling. My flight TK60 on 19 November to Kuala Lumpur was supposed to have left at 00.55 was delayed 6 hours. I landed in Istanbul at 22.20 from Germany to avail of the connecting flight. It was a nightmare to be stuck in Istanbul airport to face their most unprofessional and rude ground staff. A meal voucher was handed to me around 2.00 as though they were doing me a big favor. I have found their ground staff from security personnel to customer service very rude. Most airlines depend more on their economy passengers for profit. The rude attitude towards their economy passengers mar their slogan of being a 4 star airline. I will avoid Turkish airlines in future.,Detractor
I was flying from Europe to Shanghai than back from Kathmandu. On the first leg of my journey I was really amazed by the quality and quantity of food and drinks.

I have flown Turkish Airlines several time this year and last! I have some current business in Turkey and Tanzania and used TA for these trips.

Tel Aviv - Istanbul - Edinburgh. Both flights on older 737s - very little leg room IFE on small overhead screens too far away to see.

We asked for it but they were talking each other and never communicated to us. We instead asked for regular meal for my son. Staff service from KTM to IST to JFK was horrible.

Worst Customer Service. The trip to Istanbul went without a hitch. The trip from Istanbul to Barcelona was delayed. Their customer service is quite horrible.

London to Dhaka via Istanbul twice in the last month. Usually I have a good experience with Turkish. However this time it was not so great. The London to Istanbul segments were mostly OK with the exception of the last return flight which was one of the most unpleasant flights I have had in a long time. It started with the children from hell in the row behind. The aircraft was an older A321 which had very poor leg room no IFE to speak of and it was too hot. One lady was quite ill because of the heat. The cabin crew refused to do anything despite complaints. I think everyone just wanted to get off so we were not pleased at having to fly around London on hold for half an hour. The Istanbul/Dhaka part is not operated by Turkish but by Meridiana an Italian charter operation. The A330 aircraft are old and do not come close to the normal Turkish standard. The IFE was very limited - no video on demand seats were old and business seats were basic and not worthy of the price. All airlines seem to put their worst and oldest aircraft on the routes into this part of Asia. I have flown with Emirates and Qatar Airways and both do the same. It is unfair as you do not pay any less for the ticket. On the positive side the overcrowding of the business lounge in Istanbul has improved. I did not have to sit on the floor on any of the 3 times I used it.,Detractor
I flew Turkish a couple of times in the past months and the most conspicuous feature was the seats lacking the adjustable headrest often the lack of the footrest and the lack of personal in-flight entertainment. The food was just sufficient. But the worst was on an international overseas flight of 2 hours where the in-flight entertainment on overhead screens was a football documentary. The staff were as kind and helpful as possible and the overall flight was satisfactory.,Passive
We travelled TK 1035 IST-BUD on 20 September. I had the window seat my partner the middle and an obese person who needed the extension seat belt was in the aisle. We paid AUD 553 each for the two hour flight (expensive by world standards due to no competition). My partner had the most uncomfortable journey as the obese person was spilling over into his space. Unsafe and uncomfortable. All airlines need to address this disgraceful practice inflicted on passengers who are within a healthy weight range.,Detractor

Birmingham to Dalaman via Istanbul and return. First time I've used Turkish Airlines and it won't be the last. Clean comfortable planes with plenty of leg room friendly crew members good meal on 4hr flight and snacks on short domestic flight.

My only complaint would be that the cabin was very hot and the air conditioning was ineffective.,Promoter
I and my husband were traveling from LAX round trip. The travel agent did all booking so I suppose the pricing was fair. From LAX to Istanbul the plane was new and clean although restrooms after 3 hours were dirty until the end of 13 hour long flight. No soap no paper towels to dry wet hands on. Seats were uncomfortable we felt squashed between rows. Food was good. Service was OK. Entertainment was outdated. The air in the cabin was OK. Return from Istanbul to LAX the plane was full. This time we got an old plane seats were extremely uncomfortable food was bad and the air in the cabin was hot and stuffy toilet conditions were awful. Could not sleep a minute. Given a choice I would stay away from Turkish.,Detractor
"GVA-IST-KTM return. Inconsistency is the hallmark of Turkish Airlines. It was very nice to have free drinks a nice dinner and an in-flight movie (screens above the seats) on a 3 hour European flight. However on the next leg to Kathmandu there was no seat-back IFE and when they played the movie you got English in one ear and Turkish in the other. (I would have liked a movie to block out the sound of the 3 infants near my seat.) On the way back there were seat back screens all the way even on the short-haul flight back to Geneva. The food was superb although I never know why airlines flying to majority Hindu countries don't have a vegetarian option and Turkish coffee would have been nice. Cabin attendants don't seem too concerned with safety (I don't think they check to see if seatbelts are done up) and while they may appear unfriendly I think many passengers don't pick up on the Turkish ""long-blink-with-pursed-lips"" facial expression equivalent of a smile. The policy of having one cabin attendant per trolley didn't seem to be too efficient. The two-class configuration on short haul (where one of the cabin attendants is designated as a ""chef"") may actually result in a lower staff-passenger ratio for economy passengers compared to a low-cost carrier where they need to sell. At times the staff seemed a bit overwhelmed Short delay on the Kathmandu flights - not a big deal but no explanation. On some sectors the pilots didn't address the passengers at all and other times they did. Finally the complementary tour of Istanbul for transit passengers (including food) is a nice touch. Clearly Turkish have the right idea they just need to standardise their product.",Passive
Flew HKG-CDG-HKG Premium Economy Aug/Oct 2013 with a stop in Istanbul. Unfortunately Istanbul - CDG leg was in economy as no Premium available.

LHR-IST-DAC. LHR-IST in cramped A320 rushed and poor service with cabin crew having very poor English skills. Crew forgot to serve our row and when this was pointed out was shown palm as she was 'busy' and would deal with it when she had time. Finally got meal served 45 minutes later than other passengers. On arrival at Istanbul TK ground staff showed indifference to questions asked about the complimentary 'TourIstanbul' offer for long transits indicating I would have to find out at my own initiative if I could avail it and that they would not be able to provide any advise! Ataturk Airport is busy but has a good selection of duty free and some nice lounges. IST-DAC on leased Meridiana Aircraft. Terrible flight poor service. However flight departed on time and arrived early. I had no in-seat entertainment console/remote as it had been ripped off its place I assume hence was unable to view inflight entertainment - did not miss much it was only 5 channels of not-so-new movies. Cabin crew were lax with security and the service was very poor. TK takes pride in their 'Turkish Hospitality' but I found the hospitality of theirs quite poor to be truthful. I certainly will not be flying with them again. TK is no competition for the likes of EK QR or even BA for that matter.,Detractor
My decision to fly this time with Turkish was based on getting a flight at the most economic price with the shortest stopovers: Stuttgart via Istanbul to Cape Town and back. I was pleasantly surprised! The service at the counter was very professional and friendly. No long queues. No hassle with a bag being slightly too thick (having to be re-packed as done at other airlines) and an allowance of 30kg checked in baggage great. Unlike the often older aircraft used by other airlines the planes Airbus were modern and the entertainment systems worked. The food and refreshments excellent! Service good. What a pleasant surprise to be able to purchase goods at the airport in Istanbul in Euros. My only advisory comment is that Turkish need to train their staff how to handle difficult (or rude) customers as they sometimes seemed to be impatient with these. I will definitely fly Turkish again and highly recommend it.,Promoter

Our family of five adults recently traveled from Los Angeles (LAX) to IST to DAR and back. The new lounge in IST is gorgeous! The LAX-IST legs were excellent: comfortable seats attentive staff good food. The IST-DAR legs were only fair: seat controls didn't work staff was less than attentive food was mediocre. But the biggest problem we had was with the online reservation system. Even though I had printouts of the electronic tickets the system kept saying we had not booked and did not allow me to check in. Worse than that the ground personnel had a lot of trouble checking us in. By using the electronic ticket numbers (and not the confirmation code which said our reservations didn't exist) the agent could see our reservation but not check us in or print out boarding passes. Very frustrating! Finally they figured out a work-around and we were able to board.,Passive
I flew Turkish Airlines for the first time recently and was very impressed. I just flew shorter flights between Athens and Istanbul and Izmir and Istanbul but found the cabin crew to be professional and gracious and even on a one hour regional flight still received a meal of a whole grain roll with cheese green lettuce and tomato with some yoghurt as well. After flying United with its deathly pale iceberg lettuce and overcooked food on a long flight it was really refreshing! Maybe I was on the newer planes but they were so clean and with individual screens even on shorter flights. Great experience.,Promoter
Travelled from ISB to IST and return in January 2013. I would never fly TK again to Turkey. I would rather take the middle eastern carriers. The flight lasted 6 hours and there was no IFE.

Sep 25 to fly from Houston to Istanbul. We had about a 20 minute delay but we arrived on time to Istanbul. We flew using Economy and our legs were pretty cramped in there because the guy in front of us who had an exit row leaned his seat back.

Very attentive service needs were taken care of before you asked and very good food although I have had even better food on other THY flights. My real issue is with the business class seat sleeping comfort on the A340-300.I am not sure at what angle the seat reclines but it is pretty nasty I was annoyed because the ticket price was pretty high. I wonder why Turkish a forward looking airline as using the A340-300 on the IST-KL run with this seating arrangement in business class.

I flew business class from CGK-IST-AMS overall it was a great experience but unfortunately it was not very memorable. The seat itself was great and comfortable the cabin layout was modern and clean however I found out that the cabin crew seemed to be inconsistent.

On the other side indeed there were the dedicated cabin crew who were willing to care and serve the passengers.

Four flights with Turkish in the past two weeks - all in economy. Cape Town to Istanbul Istanbul to Paris London Gatwick to Istanbul and Istanbul back to Cape Town. All flights were on time or early. The planes were reasonably new clean and comfortable. The flight back to Cape Town was completely full but even that wasn't uncomfortable. The staff were always helpful and polite. The seats are reasonably comfortable with good pitch - my gripe is the foot rest which isn't convenient if you are tall and gets in the way when folded up. The entertainment system is varied and the screens large (no individual screens on the plane from Gatwick). Food was plentiful and tasty. And there are a few extras - a substantial amenity kit - sometimes in a tin. Slippers and a Turkish delight as a welcome sweet. And in addition their prices are excellent so it doesn't surprise me that they keep winning awards.,Promoter

We flew economy from Bangkok to HCMC (Saigon). The cabin was the dirtiest I've encountered. When I opened the tray table there was vegetable matter there gravy had dripped down the seat as well as what looked like cola. The floor hadn't been cleaned as there were food scraps along the floor mounts. No IFE at all. Food was a dismal chicken and cheese sandwich and a slice of cake. One of the exit lamps was playing up so the attendant whacked it with her hand - to no avail. Cabin crew were inattentive and appeared bored. This flight originated in Istanbul and flew to HCMC via Bangkok. Perhaps the crew didn't change in BKK? The plane was an older 777-300 and the seats looked like they needed a good scrub. By comparison the business class seats looked good. It beats me how this airline has won 'Best European Airlines' 3 years running.,Detractor

My first TK A330-300 trip my first Y experience on TK for a long time. The plane was full. I have never seen speciality meals delivered through the same door the pax were boarding very unprofessional.

I have never seen giant garbage bags piled up at the doors during the flight as if there was no place to store it. Never seen one of the chefs coming off from his rest in a t-shirt carrying his uniform in his hand. It was chaotic for the whole flight constant shuttling of food trays bags drinks back and forth. Slow inattentive service. Good luck to the cleaning crew to turn it around on time. On the plus side most of the front lavatories were larger than I'm used to Thanks to the inflight entertainment iphone and my noise cancelling headphones I was happy.

The luggage marked with the priority label arrived on the conveyor belt approx after 50% of all suitcases.

The choices for breakfast were poor and it was a poor selection for me. The entertainment system choices were acceptable. The cabin staff were disinterested for me except for the chief. Cabin WiFi was good.",Passive
" Bangkok to Gatwick via Doha. Ground service in Bangkok was mixed, check in and security were fine and very quick. Disappointed that the nice ticket wallets seem to no longer be issued (I wondered if it was a glitch on my outbound).. hardly necessary but was a nice touch. The lounge showers were not working. Thankfully I knew I could use the JAL lounge which was close by, but this was not offered by the staff when I made clear my disappointment at theirs not functioning. Other than that the lounge was excellent. Premium feeling but lovely food and drink options, very attentive professional staff and a nice mix of comfy and practical seating. Annoyingly the lounge was absolutely no where near the gate they were using tonight, approx 20 min walk. Whilst you expect this at the airlines hub airport, you do not expect it when at another world airport. With only a handful of flights a day and a dedicated lounge it should be possible to fly from gates at least on the same side of the airport. When eventually getting to the gate, having been prompted by lounge staff that the plane was boarding, all bus passenger had to stand for another 15 mins before they actually started boarding as the gate was so packed full there were no seats. Lounge in Doha is cavernous. Having visited a few times now I have decided that overall I don't like it, and as Qatar airways expands and the lounge gets busier I like it less and less. Because it is just open space it always feels busy. The chairs are not particularly comfortable and there are coffee/soft drinks stands dotted about fairly sparsely, with main food and drink at either end. Obviously there are staff walking around who can provide you drinks, but I prefer more self service drinks to also be available. On board the service was excellent on both flights. Wonderful crew, and good quality food and drinks. Seats are very comfortable. On the 777 it was the old seat, although I actually really like this. It's not quite fully flat but still very nice with excellent storage and I slept well. IFE is fine. Lots of choice and good resolution however the interface is clunky and unresponsive on both systems. The new one on Qsuite is much better. Landing in Gatwick reminds me that in spite of a lot of improvements Gatwick is still a horrible airport.. but it is convenient for me. Bags arrived quickly and immigration had a short queue. Overall flight was excellent although very slight downgrades in quality, and price increases are making this not quite as appealing for leisure travellers. Being Oneworld is a massive perk as tier point collection for BA is very good.",Promoter
" Unbelievable level of personalised service even in the cheap seats. My wife and I have just completed 4 flights with Qatar Airways. Travelling to London from Melbourne via Doha and return. The first thing we noticed was the extended boarding time on the A380 which ensured orderly and relaxed boarding with no pushing and shoving and fighting for overhead bin space. The inflight service on 3 of the 4 flights was the best we have ever had in economy class. The service on the second flight while not in the same class as the other 3 flights was certainly as good as our regular carrier SQ so to complain would be pedantic. The choice of 3 options of meal (1 of which is vegetarian) at meal times was a pleasant addition and all meals I ate on all flights were full flavoured generous in size healthy and a step above the mush some airlines offer. Plenty of snacks and beverages offered throughout the flight. In short food and beverage is plentiful and with the extended choice of options should satisfy most passengers. Seat comfort (we had 3 A380 flights and 1 B787) was terrific enough legroom and width, the A380 was a little more generous and much quieter in the cabin than the B787. In fact the A380 certainly was the clear winner between both plane variants. The inflight entertainment system Oryx 1 was superb and offered a great selection of movies from new releases through to classics from the golden years of Hollywood, Music selection was the best I have encountered on an inflight entertainment system and I listened to a fair few full length albums to while away the time. Finally big shout out to the excellent Qatar flight crews who were professional, exuberant and hardworking with no crew vanishing acts here like most long hauls where you struggle to find crew after the first main meal service. In fact my wife mentioned as we were at the baggage carousel at Tullamarine, that it was the freshest she had ever felt after a long haul flight home, given we did London Doha (6.5 hours) 3 hours in the Oryx Lounge at Doha, then Doha To Melbourne (13.5 hours) . Qatar Airways have now won my long haul business. Unfortunately with no direct Melbourne Singapore or Melbourne Vietnam services I am still shackled to SQ whose standards have been slipping for the last 3 years. Thank you Qatar see you again in September when I test drive your new Lisbon route.",Promoter
" Doha to Munich. Crew: Awesome, dedicated, beautiful, pleasant, and attentive. The crew and the supervisor onboard of the flight were top notch. The best that I have interacted with compared to other airlines. The crew kept checking in with me to see if I am comfortable. Aircraft: The Qsuite was clean, comfortable and private. The in-flight entertainment system was responsive and showed no signs of lag. F&B: Spoilt for choices. The signature drink was a blast. Fine dining experience. Overall, the food was awesome. Overall, this airline has won my heart. I was smitten by the level of service and I will keep on flying with QR.",Promoter
" I was woken on a 9 hour flight, nearly hours before landing, and being asked if I want to be woken for food in an hours time.

Food is okay, business class chairs I felt uncomfortable. Crew was a mixed bag from ok to poor.",Detractor
" Johannesburg to London via Doha. Normally I love Qatar Airways but this experience wasn't so good. When I flew LHR to JNB via DOH everything was great. The brilliant service, plenty of food, great entertainment system and nice aircraft. The way back was not as good. The check-in assistant at JNB was incredibly rude as he spoke to his colleague the whole time he was checking me in and looked at me in a contemptuous way. I suspect he might be employed by the airport as I had the same experience at passport control and security. The route JNB - DOH was ok. The plane was nice and spacious and the seats were very comfortable. A female passenger moved next to me because the passenger behind her had placed her bare feet in full view on the first passenger's armrest. No one told her to put her feet away. They ran out of beef and chicken dishes and only had vegetarian left which I refused to eat as it was dal and spinach which seemed like a bad choice for a flight. The attendants tried really hard to find alternatives and credit to them for their efforts and professionalism. The airline needs to review its meal quotas for each flight. The route DOH - LGW was cramped and uncomfortable - the seats didn't go back as far. The snack was a choice of pizza or pizza with chicken. I don't eat cheese but luckily a member of the cabin crew found me something else. Staff were also great on this flight. The onboard WIFI is terrible. On two separate flights I signed up for the one hour free. The WIFI wouldn't connect until the hour was up, at which point it told me free WIFI was no longer an option. On the other two flights it worked ok but had periods where it wouldn't connect. Compared to Emirates, Qatar Airways staff are friendlier and more obliging and they give you more food. If all Qatar Airway's planes were as good as the JNB-DOH route and they didn't run out of food then they would definitely be my favourite airline.",Passive

" I know Qatar Airways well after flying them for a couple of years and maintaining my Platinum frequent flyer status. I noticed some decline in the standard of their business class product over the last year or so. Qatars big strength was always its consistency of their business class. That is not the case anymore. The flight from Stockholm to Doha was top notch service wise, but the flight to Singapore was a different matter. The Qsuite was great as always, but service wasn't. The Purser in charge never introduced herself or said goodbye, nothing. The lady in charge of my section was obviously hating her job. No smile, very slow and chaotic service, wine was served after the main course. My seat could not move 2h before arrival and I had to sit on the bed for breakfast. When the plane started to descend, I was still sitting and my third reminder to look at the seat was ignored by her. I asked someone else and within 5 minutes I was given another seat for landing. Overall a rather disappointing flight, I hope my return next week will be better.",Detractor
" DEL-DOH-BCN in Economy a mixed bag experience. On the positive side, clean, crisp equipment and very professional crews, cheap WiFi when it works.

They provided no value to status customers - can't pre reserve extra leg room seats or exit rows, zero status recognition, members lounge in Doha is appalling.",Passive

" Barcelona to Mumbai via Doha in Economy class, paid to upgrade to business on DOH-BOM segment during online check in. On balance this was a good experience, not great. BCN-DOH on an A350 that apparently is owned by Latam and operated by Qatar. Branding was Qatar, but business class configuration was pure Latam - ie 2x2x2 - hence when they asked for in excess of 700 Euro to upgrade for a 6.5 hour flight I passed. Economy was pleasant as the flight wasn't crowded and I had three seats to myself. I did opt to upgrade on the DOH-BOM segment, as it was a Q-suite configured aircraft, and priced at just over 300 euro for a late night three hour flight arriving at 2:30am. India flights all running full post Jet Airways collapse so I thought it smart to upgrade. The Q-suite product is very good, although I found the suite a bit claustrophobic. Service was good. There's a bit of a cool demeanor with their cabin crews. Zero special treatment or recognition for Oneworld Emerald for seat allocation or onboard. The Doha lounge was overrated and almost appalling for me. In summary, the trip was good, not spectacular.",Passive
" Washington to Bangkok in economy class on a 777. I arrived 70 minutes before the flight, leaving 10 minutes to spare before the official cutoff time. There were three ticket agents and no one else in line. However, there apparently was some debate over who would have to serve me, as no one would check me in. Several times a clock behind the counter was pointed to, and the agents wandered off without acknowledging me. Finally a supervisor asked one of the agents to take care of me. The agent again pointed to the clock (which at this point was still about 7 minutes prior to the cutoff) but the supervisor pointed to the work station and finally I was attended to. On board, the flight crew seemed neglectful, we were pushing back during the safety presentation and there were passengers standing in the aisles. The inflight experience was fine. The seats were comfortable, legroom was adequate, and the cabin was clean, and even economy class gets an amenity kit. The meals were the highlight, with multiple cuisines on offer. An hour of free wifi is included for anyone who pays enough attention to read these things, and the connection speed was truly exceptional. The only complaint about the inflight experience was the headphone jack. If you want to use your own headset, bring a two pronged adapter, or you'll suffer through the adequate but not much-more-than-that headset provided. My second flight was 10 hours after my first, and the Doha Airport is a tragic experience unless you have, or pay for lounge access. or you have a desire to shop for high end luxury brands of clothing and luggage. The connecting flight was just like the first, but with no seat charging options. A bit surprising to not have that option, but the entertainment system was good enough to keep me amused. All in, this was better than my last few experiences on Qatar, and I wouldn't tell friends to avoid them. Just get there earlier than the cutoff, and bring a battery and a headphone adapter.",Passive
 Belgrade to Sydney via Doha. I decided this year to do my Balkans trip with Qatar having used Lufthansa and Emirates before. What a classy Business class. Now i know why they are voted the best in the world. The service from Doha to Sydney was fantastic and also the trip going over to Belgrade. This airline is without doubt leaving the others in there wake. Having had to fly Qantas to get to Sydney and vice versa Business class it makes you realise how poor our own Qantas airline is. The cabin crew on Qatar know how to serve (thats a word lacking in our countries airline) they were tireless in there quest to serve great meals and wine and ensure we were well looked after. Pity they do not fly to Brisbane which would avoid the sub standard Q we have to use. Well done Qatar you're great.,Promoter
" Doha to New York. The Airbus A350-1000 is the latest addition to Qatar Airways' fleet, with its Q Suites that have been raved as the best business class product in the world. In my opinion, it is indeed the best business class product I experienced to date. First and Business Class passengers had their own vast premium check-in area and, not a separate line but a separate security screening facility, which made the whole process peaceful and seamless. The lounge at Doha airport was huge and beautiful. It was quite crowded when I came as it took me a while to find a dining table. However, it did not seem like a chronic issue as it was cleared shortly after. Food offerings were OK, not inspiring providing this was their home base. The gate area, though, was tight and crowded, but I think that was more about the airport. However, as QR is the main operator of the airport, I am surprised why they do not exercise their influence on the design of the gate, which has just been recently completed, to match their excellent service. My Q Suite, in my opinion, was the most intelligently designed business class seat I have seen (those included AA, DL, UA, CX, CI, JL, RJ, BR, TK, BA, OZ, VN, KE, GA and more). The suite may have appeared a bit claustrophobic with the door closed, but it felt totally different with generous shoulder room and hip room, which made sleeping so easy and comfortable. QR offered pajamas and turn down service, a first class perk. Cabin service and food were excellent, and meals were presented nicely, a la carte and on demand. I really enjoyed the flight.",Promoter

 Flight from Bangalore to Doha was an early morning flight. Extremely orderly boarding process followed by informative captains announcement. One gripe on this leg was the aircraft was on the colder side with no blanket! They had a few and was handed out for people who requested them. The food was good and the flight attendants were as always very attentive. On landing though we had to take a bus from the aircraft to the terminal. This caused a lot of people to panic and run to their connections. I had a two hour layover but had just enough time to make it to my gate. The second leg was a longer flight - this time the aircraft was newer and the seat back entertainment system was of higher quality. Meal service was good and timely. They served two main meals with a snack in the middle. As always the flight attendants were very attentive. Unusually they ran short of the lamb option! As for the seat - my seat was very uncomfortable. It was behind an exit row. Both the seat anchor from the front seat and the seat back entertainment system took away a major portion of the foot space. Had to find an angle to sit for the whole 12 hour journey. On arrival it took nearly an hour to retrieve bags - which is understandable. The takeoff/landing and pilot announcements were all extremely good!,Passive

 Boston to Hyderabad via Doha. Flight out of Boston left on time around 11:05PM. The aircraft type also has changed from an A350 to an aging Boeing 777-300.

The seat back entertainment system shows its age in the screen quality. However everything was working and they had a nice selection of movies. Doha airport was super clean and comfortable. Onward journey was on a newer Boeing 787-8. The legroom is still not bad. The seat width leaves much to be desired. No position allowed me to sit without rubbing elbow on the armrest.

But more amazing to me was that to pay, I had to provide one of those old style credit cards where the name and numbers are embossed as the attendant had no electronic card reader. She took out a mechanical contraption, placed my card on it and over it a multiple sheets credit card slip and then pulled a slide over them to get the imprint.

To make matters worse - when I boarded the aircraft and saw this business class cabin I told the cabin chief that I expected QSuites and he began arguing that this flight doesn't have QSuites - a few minutes later I was told that this was a mistake and that the aircraft was changed.

" Birmingham to Manila via Doha return in economy class. Overall a pleasant experience across the four sectors flown with only one delay of less than 30 minutes due to a passenger feeling unwell. The BHX-DOH sectors were on a B787, which was probably starting to show its age. For example the AVOD system on these planes is not as sleek as on the B777 which were used for the DOH-MNL sectors, however both provided a good selection of movies both new and old, TV shows, music and games. Seats are generally comfortable although the box for the AVOD system cuts into legroom if you are seated by the aisle or window. The recline is good on both planes as the lower portion of the seat moves forward slightly as the back portion reclines, giving slightly more recline overall. The quality of the food was generally excellent across all sectors, however I was disappointed that on three of the four sectors my first choice was unavailable by the time I was served. On one occasion the air stewardess did make up for this slightly by offering me a crew meal which was similar, however it would be better if the meal choices were available to more of the passengers. Drinks were available throughout the flights although in between meal service you need to go to the galley and ask. We were provided with an amenity kit on the DOH-MNL sectors which included an eye mask, travel socks, toothpaste, toothbrush and lip balm. Free Wi-Fi was available for a limited time on all sectors although the speed on the DOH-MNL sectors was much better - again this might be due to the age of the aircraft. USB ports were available on both planes to charge devices. For the price I paid I was very happy with the service provided and would definitely use Qatar Airways again.",Promoter

Can't contact Qatar, their phone number is in Doha and I am not paying to call them for poor service. Arrive at airport 2hrs and 20min before flight. Huge lineup for Qatar Airways with only two economy counters open. Also a line for web check-in drop off bags - which would have been great had Qatar allowed me to check in online.

" Bangkok to Gatwick via Doha. We were having a light snack and a drink before boarding the aircraft at Bangkok airport with plenty of time for us to get to the gate (50 minutes). We saw on the airport screen that the flight was closing, we ran thinking that we had missed the flight. This was 45 minutes before departure. We got to the gate at the same time as many other passengers rushing to get there. We felt badly treated as there was no reason to rush us that way when the plane was not ready to leave.",Passive
" Sydney to Amman via Doha. My transit was in Hamad Int'l Airport, Doha. I missed my connection flight as the time in the screen was departure time and I thought (as other airports) was the boarding time so when I went to the gate, at what I thought was boarding time, the flight had departed already. The customer service personnel at Hamad Int'l airport were very helpful, professional and kind. At first I was going to be charged for the change in flight, but when I explained the situation, Qatar Airways understood and did not charge me a cent (especially thankful after a long flight and being very tired). That is first class service. Thank you to Qatar Airways for this help. A recommendation to be considered, any changes in airport policies or procedures (new or from old practices), it would be great if an email is sent to all who purchased the tickets, I don't think this would be very costly to the Qatar Airways and it would highly appreciated. Example: Hamad Int'l airport is a silent airport, I did not know that until I faced this issue. Please put notice on the screen if the time is departure or boarding time. Thanks again from a very happy customer.",Promoter

" We made a request to get front of cabin row seats as my partner had an injury and was wearing a leg brace. Qatar Airways kindly gave us front of cabin seats in the middle. Unfortunately, cabin staff also used this as a thoroughway, which wasn't too good for sleeping. QR did not have pre-dinner drinks service, only with food. However, staff happily served us drinks when we press attendants' bell. Seats are decent for sitting, not so comfortable for sleeping in.

Meal quality average - soggy rice, overcooked beef, over salted rice salad. No pre-meals drink service - only once with the meal. However, water or juice was served twice more on the 5 hrs and 40 min flight. Responses to button calls for attendants were very quick. Overall, good service but poor food.",Passive

While not as spectacular as their QSuite, the seat design and comfort is still top of the line for its class.

" Mumbai to Doha, on a Boeing 777. On this flight we had the QSuite configuration. The seat hardware blows away all the competition. The comfort and space is closer to the First Class seating found on many other airlines. I haven't seen Singapore or Cathay Business in recent years (Qatar's closest competition) but I don't think either has anything like the seats of QSuite. Even the lavatory design is outstanding. Qatar's in-flight service is very good, but I would rank Lufthansa, Swiss and ANA a notch higher in this department. Where Qatar fell short is at the Al Mourjan Business Lounge in Doha. Physically it is an impressive space. However, during the morning peak hour it transforms into a bus station with all the unpleasantness that goes with it. It is surprising that Qatar hasn't thought through this as well as the energies they have put into their in-flight product. We had to stand outside for 15 mins for a shower and the restaurant upstairs was packed to the gills with many turned away due to lack of seating space.",Promoter

It was a day flight so no need to sleep and the cabin and ride was great, I picked this flight as I hadn't flown the 787 before and wanted too.

"  Copenhagen to Bangalore via Doha. This time my flights were a mixed bag and somewhat disappointing, especially the sectors BLR-DOH and DOH-CPH on 09 January 2019. Both flights full, the first leg being a real flight from hell because of screaming children who wouldn't stop during the 4 hr flight. QR has added an extra seat on their B777-200LR's as well as B777-300ER's during their latest refurbishment (3-4-3 in Economy), which makes the seating extremely cramped and the aisles too narrow. I'm 6""1' and due to the too narrow seat, it was very hard to find a comfortable position to eat or rest, the seat is simply not suitable for me. The cabin crew are all very good and hard-working, meals OK for Economy and the Oryx entertainment system way above many competitors, but I found it hard to enjoy all this due to the problems mentioned. We had 55 min connection at CPH (QR to SAS) but since QR was delayed due to an extremely long taxiing at DOH, we managed to catch SAS thanks to the security check and passport control at CPH, however, our bags didn't make it and came 24 hrs later due to the fact that QR has one ground handling agent at CPH and SAS another. All in all, QR is a good airline to fly with and DOH is a great airport as suggested by fellow travellers as well but, in my opinion, the cramped cabins in Economy don't reflect a five-star experience and the cabin crew struggle on the narrow aisles to provide five-star service they have been so well trained for. A mixed bag, really.",Passive

However, no pre-meal drink service, meal service commenced 90 minutes after take off, no cup holders as part of tray, very tight seat pockets.

" Washington to Doha. I had an award ticket and wanted to change the date on my return. I have modified my ticket in the past during previous holidays and it was a relatively easy process usually completed with a single phone call to Qatar Airways customer service. I called Qatar Airways and the representative informed me that I should contact the Privilege Club department, as Qatar Airways does not deal with award tickets. I called the Privilege Club department which informed me that I need to submit my request using their online contact center. If this wasn't already a convoluted process, the automatic response to my request from the contact center was that I had to wait 3 business days before my request could be tended to. How is this practical when a customer needs to make an urgent change? My request was simple - I just wanted to know what dates were available for me to change my return ticket to and what the cost of implementing such a change would be. The response I finally received three business days later, was a generic one that did not even address my request. They replied stating that a change would cost $25 if completed 24 hours or more prior to departure and $100 if within 3 and 24 hours of departure. However, they did not provide me with any answer as to what dates were available for me to change my award ticket to. Not only did I have to wait for 3 business days to receive a response, but the response I received was completely unhelpful and useless. Having to wait 3 business days to get a response is unreasonable, especially when the responses are not helpful. My case was an urgent one and could not wait a week, let alone three business days. attempted to contact someone from the Privilege Department on Friday and was told that my request would be expedited. I tried to follow up the next day but because it was a Saturday, the offices were closed. I tried to call on Sunday and was informed that the office was closed. What is the point of being a privilege club member if the customer helpline is not open on Saturdays and Sundays while the general Qatar Airways customer service helpline is? I would rather be a standard, non-privilege customer and receive more reliable and timely customer service, than be a privilege club customer and have to wait days upon days for anything that even remotely resembles a response.",Detractor

" Flew Kigali to Frankfurt via Doha 14-15 December 2018 on A330-200 and Boeing 777ER respectively. Upgraded from N-class to U-class (business upgrade) for credits in their FFP. Flights on time despite economy was overly full on both sectors and even business also on last stretch (DOH-FRA). Check-in in KGL took ages due to incompetent 3rd part company who don't know basic and ask a lot of superfluous questions which already are in the computer and on the BPs. Lounge decent, large, good snack and hot dishes - but no lane view as windows are blinded with ugly tape. Business passengers got special bus to drive 250 meters, a joke and waste of time and resources. Onboard: welcome drinks provided, food is embarrassing for QR and is getting worse and worse the 2 most recent years. FA's and drinks are top notch, however. Hardware and precision is unchallenged. Q-suites is over-rated unless you fly in a group and want to be together. Was granted access to the Al Mourjan lounge in Doha which normally denies even One World elite travelers on upgrades. Terrible bus-gating in Doha. Takes hours and undermine any feel of the qualities provided onboard. They have separate biz buses to reduce the pain for elite travelers but the difference is minimal as all are reduced to public transport which only leaves when the bus is full. Worse is the charity announcements on board. Very introduce and ridiculous.

I also learned the lesson of booking directly with Qatar Airways instead of an online website. You will pay hundreds of dollars extra to change a ticket with an online website. When I flew back from Bangkok , the ticketing agent there was also extremely anal retentive about my carry-on weight.

" The website only permits one trip, but I wish to provide feedback for both inbound as well as outbound. The outbound was great, as I have come to expect with QR (who I have been flying with long haul premium for about 4 years). Nothing to be faulted. The 787 was a great business class, enhanced by the quality of the product and service. On the other hand, the 777 from Doha to JFK took the business class experience to a totally new level. The QSuites product, in my mind, is the best business class offering around, which compares favourably with the FC offering of some major airlines. Not to mention the numerous onboard staff and their fantastic service - in particular a young gent who led the onboard team from Doha to Jakarta on the return leg was outstanding! This is not to ignore the contributions of the other young gents and ladies who made both my trips a totally memorable experience. To summarise, QR business class was an outstanding product, mainly thanks to the commitment of their people. QR QSuites takes this to a totally new level! To get the perfect product, QR should either provide free internet for their premium customers (and reduce the pricepoint for the economy) or be more generous with the allowances, and reduce internet access prices. I suspect that this will happen soon anyway.",Promoter
 Dallas to Kathmandu via Doha. I am satisfied with the flight experience. Ground service experience was very bad at Dallas baggage size was a big deal.

" Doha to New York JFK. Excellent flight on a refurbished aircraft that has completely changed the business class travel experience on this route by creating a sense of big space while providing much needed privacy. On previous travel on this morning flight from Doha to JFK, the plane had a 2-2-2 open layout -- affording no privacy at all while being crowded, having to jump over a passenger if you were not on the aisle seat. Now, the new Q-Suite layout has changed all that. The configuration is 1-2-1, some seats face the back of the plane. There is a ""door"" that seals off your little cubicle equipped with all you need - plug and charge points, large pull out desk table to eat and work on, counters to keep your possessions, a hook to hang your coat, a cupboard for your footwear, reading lights, duvets, pillows, a large TV screen with numerous entertainment choices, and a seat that adjusts in many ways including lie flat. I was able to sleep several hours in absolute privacy in a window seat, 3A. The flight attendants are drawn from many countries of the world and they speak English well. There was a very large menu of food and drinks - cards listing them provided. Qatar provides meals and drinks on request throughout the flight. I am not partial to this form of service. One has to either call the flight attendant or go to the alley to place one's order -- they are delivered to your seat. Overall, the quality of the food is so-so but you are bound to find something that you fancy. Too much effort goes into laying the table cloth and the folded napkin across the waist and setting the place and cleaning it, time and again. Qatar is having an outsize impact on the environment by being so extravagant with their on-demand food and drink service. The flight was smooth and arrived on time. Choice of hot and cold towels were offered at take off and landing. Amenities kit was a hard shell bag, pink in color. Arrival was at Terminal 8 at JFK which is very good compared to the other terminals - in terms of space, facilities, and quickness of official services. I arrived alert and rested.",Promoter
" Kolkata to Doha. Smooth and comfortable late, late night flight in a window seat with very attentive service. The flight leaves Calcutta at 3:15 in the morning. Boarding was a bit tentative as passengers had been let into the aero bridge but the aircraft was not yet ready to board. Was welcomed on board, shown to seat, and coat taken to be hung in the closet. The spacious cabin was clean and designed in a 1-2-1 layout. Hot towels, welcome drinks, menu card, and an amenities package provided. Nicely groomed flight attendant from Chile was engagingly talkative! A large entertainment system was on offer including films from all over the world. Lie flat seat provided good sleep on this less than five hour flight and on waking up saw a beautiful sight of dawn breaking behind in the East. Breakfast had been selected in advance - an Indian vegetarian dish. It was served at the time requested. It was the only negative aspect of the flight - the food looked ugly, it was overly salted, and the ingredients could not be identified - virtually inedible. On arrival, the front door opened to a dedicated air bridge for biz cabin passengers to disembark. Departure and arrival on schedule. A very high quality product save for the meal.

 Zanzibar to Doha. Late afternoon departure from Zanzibar. The aircraft was an Airbus 320 with old-style Business class seats. I had a window seat in row 2 of 3. The flight was just over 6 hours long and I felt terribly uncomfortable for the whole duration of the flight. When the seats in front of me were fully reclined it gave a claustrophobic feeling and it was very difficult to get up from the seat. It would have been okay for 2 hours but not for 6. The service was a little confused with two FA's for a full Biz class cabin (12 pax). iPads delivered for entertainment but very limited selection.,Detractor
" Clark to Boston via Doha, the flight from Clark to Doha was lovely. Unfortunately, there were some problems at the gate for the flight to Boston in the Doha airport, such as a seat reassignment due to a supposed change in aircraft (which does not seem to have occurred after all), boarding which was delayed by about 40 minutes (which led to a departure which was 40 minutes late, too), and a staff member in charge of boarding who appears to have been angry at some passengers for not showing up only when their zone was called, despite her not audibly calling anyone up for boarding after the initial invitation for business class and special assistance passengers! The cabin crew for this particular flight were outstanding and made up for the issues with the ground staff! This particular flight featured quite possibly the worst turbulence I have ever endured in my life--and I once flew through a typhoon. The flight attendants managed to serve us meals during one of the bumpiest parts of the flight and did not drop or spill anything. They continued to smile and politely ask passengers if they needed anything else. One even offered me a special meal which another passenger had not shown up for! I am a big fan of Qatar Airways--so much so that I endure 8 hour long layovers in Doha every time I fly with them, just because the experience is wonderful every time. The food is delicious, creative, and plentiful. It's also often the cheapest ticket! This time for example, my round trip ticket was for less than $900!

Being a privilege club member I have nearly always taken advantage of the email offers to upgrade 1 or both legs of a flight for a very reasonable price. On this flight I thankfully read the offer through and noticed lounge access is not included and I dont see the value anymore in upgrading. 2nd leg of Doha-Helsinki was less than 1/3 full and business was completely empty and soon they will be upgrading the aircraft to A330 from Boeing 787 from Helsinki.",Passive

On arrival there was no stroller and I complained at Qatar airways office at Doha airport directly after arrival before leaving the airport. Since October 4th, I was trying to keep in touch with the baggage service team. I called many many time and every time they answered that they are waiting for the Montreal team to answered. Finally, the day before my flight back to Canada they told me that it's not Qatar airways liability that I miss the stroller. I agree that I have to have a tag number but if the staff told me that they cannot give me tag number because of the cargo problem that they have what I can do except trusting them.

Freedom to choose seats after takeoff as long as we were in the back of the plane. Cabin crew were excellent. Doha to Chennai-plane was fairly full but again an aisle seat by choice.

Return legs a 4am departure from Mumbai, get there early as Mumbai is chaos - on 777-fairly full flight but crew were pleasant enough. Breakfast served which was quite good.

We landed at gate 20 and the plane for UK departed from Gate 1 so it was a mad rush but the ground staff saw me and informed the gate staff that I was late. On board flight fairly full, somebody was in my seat and refused to move but the senior cabin crew guy took me off to near the front of the plane and found me a better seat -still in economy but aisle/window choice - good and alert response to the situation.

It was the busiest time of the day at 6 am, and there was no seat, there were 21 people waiting for a shower which I was told would take 2h to clear. That lounge at peak hours, and the fact that there was no airbridge for arrival and departure with extra time spent to be driven to the plane in a remote position, were the only weakness I see in Qatar but they happen every time I fly.

" London to Colombo via Doha. Qatar Airways flies from London Heathrow Terminal 4. Check in was fast and efficient, we were offered last minute upgrades to business class for Â£590.00 for both of us on the DOH-CMB leg- we would have been happy to pay for it if it meant we get the extra tier points and miles (Me and my partner are both OW Sapphires but the check in agent said we won't get any of the extra benefits except for the flat beds). We politely asked for our bags to be tagged as fragile and she happily obliged and added a 'First Class' tag instead of 'Business' due to us being OW Sapphires. Requested for front row bulkhead seats and this was done with no hesitation. Overall, check in experience with Qatar Airways at LHR T4 was swift and efficient. As oneworld Sapphires, we get business class lounge and we were able to use the Skyteam Lounge which in all honesty is nothing to write about so we hang in there for an extra hour before the Malaysia Airlines Golden Lounge opened. We weren't allowed to use the Qatar Airways Premium Lounge as we were non business class revenue passengers. Boarding, again very timely and efficient. After boarding, we noticed that the carpet on our seats were very wet- we weren't sure if it was vomit, juice or whatever. We spoke to the Inflight Service Manager explaining we weren't happy with the situation and she did her best to find us alternative seats and went the extra mile by finding us exit rows. My partner was not happy sitting in the middle and preferred a window seat and asked if we could go back to our original seats or get upgraded to business class which to our surpise, there was one and was happy to give it to one of us but we both decided we wanted to sit together. After take off, the Inflight Services Manager came to our row with 6 blankets to put on the wet carpet and sprayed it with a fabric freshener and gave us 2 glasses of champagne each for the inconvenience! The flight leaving late in the evening, the cabin crew swung into action to serve dinner and drinks to maximise passenger rest times. Despite what others have said on here regarding QR's inflight meal, they are honestly nothing to write about but disappointing. Small portion, dry and bland. But having eaten in the lounges, it didn't matter to us. Cabin crew were fairly stingy with drinks as well, only giving one 150 ml can unless you ask for two. Unlike other airlines such as Qantas, Cathay Pacific and American Airlines, you get a 200 mls or 330 mls sized can opended for you and get given another can! The second meal service before landing in Doha was slightly better. The pancake was delicious. Qatar Airways' IFE selection was great, I watched one movie and the rest trying to get some rest and listening to the massive selection of music albums. IFE screen was responsive though showing its age. With the overall onboard service of Qatar Airways, I find that the onboard service to be inconsistent. Whilst the Inflight Services Manager went the extra mile to make sure our flight was a comfortable one and repeatedly apologised for the inconvenience due to the wet carpet, the younger and more juinor flight attendants were dismissive and inconsistent and the onboard meals and drink service is a bit of a hit and miss.

Inflight entertainment was not working properly so had to change seat (1st flight). FA and service onboard good, but food is poorer than before. E.g. no beef or fish are available. Lamb chops appeared to be some tough meat. Drinks are fine but sparsely loaded (they ran out of 2 beer brands and remained with Heineken only). No ice-cream.

" I booked a return flight with Qatar Airways from Sydney for a family trip to France. We had a good experience on the way to Paris and at Doha airport, flying with our young children. Our return flight was a morning flight at 8:55am from CDG airport. We had checked in online the night before. Due to a series of issues at CDG airport we arrived at the check-in counter at 8:10am, late for check-in, which closes 60 minutes before the flight. I immediately attended the Qatar Airways desk, where I explained the situation to an employee. The only response I obtained was â€œyou cannot get on the flight, we will put you on the next flightâ€. There was no attempt on behalf of the employee to problem-solve or to offer us solutions to get on our flight. At my insistence, she contacted the gate staff and again stated we would not be able to board the flight. At no stage did the employee suggest that part of our travelling party could board the flight with hand luggage only as we had already checked in online. This would have been a helpful suggestion allowing us time to reorganise our luggage and take essential items. However, the employee did not have a friendly or helpful approach, seeming to just want to put us on the next flight which was 14 hours later and would cost 2200 euros in fees. This was not an option for our family. I asked if my wife and the children could board with hand luggage only. The employee replied that it was too late. I insisted that she call the gate to see if this was a possibility. She called the gate and then told us again that it was too late, that the gate closes 20 minutes prior to departure and it was now 8:30, 25 minutes prior to departure. The employee stated that it would not be possible for us to reach the gate in five minutes- again no help was offered and her attitude was bad. At this point, we discounted her advice and ran to the gate as fast as possible with our two young children. This was a difficult experience for them and they were crying. If the employee had informed us of this option even 10 minutes earlier, we would not have had to rush as much as we did. Luckily the CDG airport staff were very helpful and my wife and children were able to get on the flight with our hand luggage. I returned to the Qatar Airways desk to re-book another flight in the evening. When I checked-in in the evening, I had to deal with poor customer service again. I have contacted Qatar Airways customer service on several occasions in the past month but their responses have basically been â€˜we are very sorry about this' but they refuse to offer any compensation or explanation. I will not fly with Qatar Airways again, which is a shame because their inflight services were pretty good but the staff at Paris CDG airport were nasty.",Detractor

I had to make an international call to Qatar's customer service in Doha as their local office has limited service hours. Found out that 1 of the connecting flights from Casablanca to Hong Kong got cancelled. Qatar refused to compensate for the loss. I had no choice but to cut short my vacation. On the return from Casablanca to Hong Kong, it happened to hit the worst typhoon in Hong Kong, so I ended up stuck in Doha airport for 17 hours while they keep delaying the flight time. There was no support at the airport, just told the passengers to wait for a while longer and asked people to go from one service counter to another for information. When they finally decided to delay the flight for another 8 hours, it was another 1.5 hour wait for them to arrange hotel accommodation. I spent 8 hours waiting at Doha airport from 5am until 1pm.

The B777 from Canberra are now the â€œSuitesâ€ version - as impressive as many reviewers have already reported and the onboard service - personal attention, food, beverage (see further comment below), in flight entertainment, ambience and comfort - as many have already stated is unmatched. My main purpose with this review is to provide guidance to passengers from CBR with the procedures unique to Canberra airport. Check-in opens three hours prior to departure and guidance indicates it closes one hour prior to departure, this is conducted by QANTAS staff at the far left QF check-in desks with the usual friendly, helpful assistance. The first of two security checks is conducted as if you were a regular domestic passenger. Qatar uses the QANTAS Business Class lounge for BC passengers, QANTAS Club members travelling in economy will not get access as they do not have a QF flight number. Approximately one hour prior to departure BC passengers are invited to access the international area of the airport - the length of the terminal and in Virgin territory. Having gone up another level there is the Border Force passport check (electronic for those with suitable passports) followed by the second full regime security check. The international departure gate now has limited duty free sales and coffee shop, snacks, bar facilities. In our case boarding was delayed by about 25 minutes meaning a longer than expected wait. Boarding was by class through separate desks. Onboard an allocated flight attendant explained the features of the Suite for first timers and offered a pre departure drink (only water and juices were mentioned but champagne is available if requested).

Given that I was seated on the last row, maybe the lady crew was thinking that it is fine to have some nice chit chat while keeping other passengers, which makes me a bit irritated. I decided to go back to sleep since i am not so sure if the lady is planning to give me my meal or not, after few minutes she tap my shoulder and asked what would I prefer for breakfast, i mentioned non-veg meal, but since she is not listening and gave me a non-veg meal.I was about to tell her but as soon as I receive my meal, the lady continued with the chitchat.

" Flew MahÃ©, Seychelles to Doha. As always Qatar Airways gives you a great travel experience. Clean new airplane and a very great crew. Selection of wine is splendid and food served when you like to eat gives you to time to work, have a nap or what watch a movie. Just a great experience. Only downside is that even in business class you have to pay extra for Wi-Fi.",Promoter
 As always a pleasure to fly Qatar Airways from Doha to Stockholm. Clean new planes and a great friendly crew. Service on top with good food and drinks. What you need after a few hours at the airport. Downside no free Wi-Fi not even in business class.,Promoter
" Hyderabad to Atlanta via Doha. Qatar Airways is by far the best business class product I have seen. It beats emirates and etihad hands down. The food is outstanding, cabin comfort is great, and all food is on demand. The lounge though very crowded at times in morning serves much better food than emirates. Biggest down side compared to emirates is no chauffeur drive. The lounge they use in Atlanta is club atl which is ludicrous. It would be an insult to call it a lounge.",Promoter
" First class service on both legs of the journey. From Doha to London I was fortunate to fly A350-1000. The Q-suite was amazing! The seat was comfortable to say the least, the blanket the best on any airline I've flowing and I've flown quite a few! Privacy could be obtained by closing the door, like the first class suite in Emirates first class. The service was excellent, with extremely attentive and courteous crew. Meal was good, with the option to dine at any time. Loved the entertainment on board- the selection is huge. Everything was slick and span! The coveted complimentary toiletry bag was a purple colour this time! All in all, a most wonderful flight! I would like to take this opportunity to extend my heartfelt thanks to the crew for a wonderful flight. Looking forward to the next one !",Promoter
" I would like to say Thank you to Qatar Airways for taking care of me and hubby during long flight from Kuala Lumpur to Paris return via Doha. It was a long journey but your staff took care of us very well. We do recommend others to please try Qatar Airways. Qatar Airways staff are really good and take care of us. They all very well deserved for appreciation. Ground Crew also very good. My fragile stuff I checked in and never broken. The ground crew was full of confidence, that their crew take care the luggage very well and got security camera every where. Food was okay. Flight was clean. Entertainment was up to date, got all new movies, TV shows and nice motivational talks. Overall I'll give 9 mark out of 10. 1 mark I cut because of food. Need to improve a bit. Thankyou once again.",Promoter
" Oslo to Melbourne via Doha. Excellent business class airline. I do a lot of business travel and have to say that some, like Qatar, are fantastic and others are not so good. The seat is big and comfortable. The service is attentive and strong. The meals were great as was the service concept - order what you want, when you want. Flights left on time, entertainment options were great - really only had positive feedback on all aspects. Had long sleeps on all flights. The business lounge in Doha airport is the best business lounge I've seen anywhere in the world, which is an added bonus. They are my airline of choice moving forward and have great reach into more minor cities in Europe than other carriers.",Promoter
" Manila to Manchester via Doha. On the 17th August, Our 2330 pm flight QR929 was canceled. This was because an accident happened a day before when Xiamen Air MF8667 skidded off the runway in a rainy thunderstorm, which led the main runway to be closed. At around 2030 pm, I went to the Main office in the terminal if our flight was canceled or not, and it was. I asked for priority accommodation because I was traveling with my immobile mother who needs rest and my son. They did not refuse as my mother is a priority passenger, and they said that they will give us accommodation also because we checked out of our condominium in Quezon City, and we had no where else to stay. The polite and very nice staff at Qatar Airways is to give us contact numbers for the new flight the next day when the runway will open, then we got on a bus to a five-star hotel that we were amazed by, which the airline paid for, not us! The next day, we get a text from the coordinator that there will be a flight at 1730 pm QR2929, we quickly packed our things and checked out. We finally got to the airport (Terminal 1) and it was shambolic, stranded passengers, crowded, with no coordination, but it was not Qatar Airways' fault, it was the airports' disappointment of not organizing this problem fluently. It took us a while for us to check-in, too crowded, especially with my disabled mom, we got through immigration, security, we finally then got to gates, In an airport, they did not have enough working boards, all of them were not working at all and we couldn't understand where to go at all, except on our ticket, our flight was supposed to depart 1730pm but we departed around 2215pm but I understand, there were too many passengers to handle though. we boarded via stairs and I complained that we did not use a lifter for catering, but that wasn't the airlines' fault though. we got into the cabin my son seated in a different row, while a sat with my mother, the seats were comfortable, the IFE was good, and the food wasn't the best but appetizing, and the staff was very helpful.

" Doha to Milan after a six hours layover at Doha Hamad Airport. I was a bit tired but not that bad, I was flying coach and I assigned myself a good window place, with just one other seat next to me as the layout was 2-4-2. I was wrong as I had under my feet the IFE box or something similar which made it so narrow. This should not be in any type of seat, but it was ok I found my space in a way to stretch my legs. My IFE was not working, just on arabic, which I donÂ´t speak and I asked for someone to help me out from the staff but after two times being ignored, I gave up and decided to something else, also If watching a film would have been a good idea.

We were told, once arrived in Doha, that the customer service will take care of us upon landing, granting us lounge access and compensation which did not happen. Nobody was there at the arrival. We talked to a chain of people and found our self begging for information. At the service desk, we were given a voucher to be used for dinner and breakfast. The value was 65 QAR, we bought a pastry, an orange juice and a coffee. No place to sleep or freshen up was given. The inflight experience was okay. There was a good amount of entertainment choice.

And in the overall situation they did a good job, but there were some little details which were not acceptable. Vienna Check in I was served by staff that did not care about me and she was doing the procedures during my check-in while talking with her colleagues next to her. I asked if she was aware that I had a short time in Doha, and after the second time she put me on the backpack the ""fast track"" stripe. I was flying their new Boeing 787, which is really an incredible product, everything is new and really clean. I was really impressed from the seats, they were really comfortable, and I had plenty of legroom. The service of the first breakfast was excellent, they provided everything quickly and good, but the in flight snack was kinda strange, I asked what were the options, and it was a meat, chicken curry or vegetable sandwich. I wanted to try the second one, but I asked which kind of vegetables were inside, and the answer was to try it and you will discover it. I enjoyed the ife product on board a lot, with the personalized remote control in each seat. Also the toilet, had a nice touch such as the hand lotion and the parfume, like 15 years ago or in some business class products, it was a kind of old school touch that I liked a lot!",Passive

" Doha to Milan. A red eye flight fully booked , the aircraft was a bit old with the Qatar Airways old configuration in Business Class but the service was still superb they offered a light dinner and full breakfast, I enjoyed the dinner but skipped the breakfast, too many calories, though the same problem is faced on all Qatar Airways flights, movies are always up to date but TV shows are old . This is the high season for Qatar Airways and their tickets are on the pricey side. As an older aircraft there was no WiFi offered.",Promoter
" When I made the online booking the flight was pretty empty so I booked a window and aisle seat for my partner and, with an empty seat in the middle. When We checked in at BKK, we were told that they had put someone in the middle seat. I asked why, was the flight full? They said it wasn't full but we're filling the cabin for â€˜safety reasons'. We asked if there was anywhere else on the plane where we could have an empty seat between us. They said no. When we got on the plane it was less than half full and there were empty rows everywhere! So why did we have to go through that at checkin. The flight was delayed for 2 hours for a technical reason. I found the food inedible. Lots of completion so won't fly them again.",Detractor
" Was looking forward to the privacy and comfort of my flight from Bangkok to Doha on the A380. But what a disappointment upon checking in at BKK airport. Qatar has three flights to Doha in the evening. One flight was cancelled, one delayed by 3 hours and my flight downsized from A380 to 777. Needless to say that my pre-booked seat was gone and I had to endure with a leftover seat for the next 7 hours. Flight was 100% full due to the other cancelled flight. 777 not nearly as comfortable as the A380 in terms of space, comfort, noise and dryness of the air. Service was average and rushed. Lounge at Doha airport very crowded as always during peak hours. I left after a while because lines even for the toilets were building up. They should really consider getting another lounge. Flight from Doha to Helsinki was much better on the smaller and reasonably comfortable B788. Overall, one flight below average, and the other good.",Passive

Qatar Airways staff is extremely friendly and helpful. They are helpful with the food, explaining well what they have on offer. They are happy to prepare you a drink that cannot just be poured out of a bottle, like my gin and tonic yesterday. They keep coming with water and juice throughout the flight every 30 minutes or so. I have never seen this on a long flight before. They are still friendly and heap it up for you. Even more surprising is the state of the toilets. I'd almost feel sorry for the crew if I hadn't paid a fair amount of money for my flight. They are still clean one or two hours before landing. Thank you for this great experience.",Promoter
" I flown Qatar Airways from Kuwait To Munich Via Doha's incredible Hamad International Airport / the 1 hour flight from Kuwait To Doha was operated on the Refurbished B777-200LR. I was sitting back in the 3-4-3 Economy, it was comfortable. The onboard Service was excellent, Crew were very friendly, it was a smooth flight. Then had a 2 hour layover in my favorite airport Hamad International, then boarded my flight to Munich on the A350-900. When I boarded the A350 I was amazed how spacious it was, both the 777 & A350 were Comfortable, but the A350 was more comfortable. The new Oryx Inflight entertainment is amazing and is very easy to use, Cabin Crew were very friendly on the second flight too, meal was excellent, there were 2 meals served on this 5 hour 40 minutes flight - first meal was a snack sandwich which tasted good, second meal was a main course breakfast, was delicious! They Were offering juices and water every 30 minutes with a nice smile, I'd like to Thank them! The seat legroom was generous, Amenity Kit was handed during boarding in Economy Class.

I was in the middle of a 3 seat combination, my husband on one side and a larger (wide) man on the other who decided that sitting for the whole flight with his legs wide open and his body taking a 1/3 of my seat made the flight very awkward. This is too close for comfort. When the food was served it was hard to make out what the food was - there was a croissant with one of meals, it was so shriveled up. Scrambled eggs with some dreadful sauce on it, other food offerings I found to be poor. My husband is 6'3"" so when fellow passenger in front reclined his seat the space became impossible. Just improve on the quality of the food and give us a bit more space, it would make a world of difference.",Detractor

My last flights onboard of A350 from Adelaide to Doha and A380 from Doha to Melbourne were absolutely fantastic.

 Travelled in Qatar First class (Doha to Perth). I am a gold member in Emirates but has decided to change carrier and tried Qatar Airways. I was not disappointed. In flight service in first is excellent. Crew were extremely friendly and clearly wanted to give a five star experience to their customers. Doha first class lounge is the best I have been. No doubt they have won a lot of awards. You need to travel with them to appreciate their superb service. A380 first class lacks as much privacy as in emirates but the seat and service makes up for all that. There are only 8 seats and crew give total attention and makes the journey one of the most memorable.,Promoter

" Zurich to Clark via Doha. It was my first time on Qatar's A359 and I can't help but notice the improvements in its new economy class product. Seat pitch was superb, and much more spacious than its Dreamliner counterpart. The new Thales entertainment system was intuitive, but the selection pales in comparison with Emirates. The gray seats provided a contrast with the maroon seat covers. While the Dreamliner economy was OK, it pales in comparison with the A359's. My only gripe with this particular A359 was that the WCs seem clunky, especially for a new aircraft. One was out of order, while the order had a broken toilet seat. As usual, Qatar's inflight service is commendable. Attendants were very responsive, courteous, and pleasant. Drinks were frequently offered, which is a practice that I would like to see in other airlines. On the DOH-CRK leg, a flight attendant was concerned that my preferred dinner from the menu was unavailable (I was on one of the last rows served), and so she made sure that I get the first pick for breakfast. These little things leave a lasting impression. I've been on a lot of trips, including many with QR, and I can't remember a time where the FAs go this extra. And of course, flying with QR will likely take you on a layover at DOH - the best airport in the Middle East. Good things aside, the flight out of ZRH was delayed for more than half an hour, which means that my almost two-hour transit time at DOH would be cut short. It wasn't the airline's fault, but it was a good call on their part to dock at a remote gate at DOH and ferry the passengers via bus directly to the transit security check. Unfortunately my checked in luggage did not make the transfers.",Promoter

" We have never experienced such amazing service on any airline. The cabin service is outstanding - friendly and supremely efficient but never intrusive. Wonderful food beautifully served and every kind of drink you can think of! The airport in Doha is like a five-star hotel and the assisted passenger service puts Heathrow and Edinburgh to shame. We had a transfer time of just over an hour between our flights and our suitcases were waiting at the carousel when we arrived. A great improvement on last year's experience from Heathrow to Edinburgh when we had four hours between flights and British Airways only managed to deliver one of our suitcases 36 hours later! The Boeing 787 is a great aircraft but we preferred the cabin layout of the Boeing 777. We will definitely choose Qatar over any other airline in future. My husband needs a wheelchair so travel can be a bit stressful but I can honestly say, this was the best flight we have ever experienced and we have been flying between South Africa and the UK for 50 years!!

Seating on the A380 is very comfy with loads of legroom and what felt like a slightly wider seat than on Singapore Airlines. Crew were lovely on both flights though bar/food service was a bit slow and we had quite a wait. No drinks cart to start with like Singapore Airlines and the food wasn't all that wonderful but compensated for by the spaciousness and the crew themselves.

On sitting down it felt as if the seat had no padding and was extremly hard. The crew were lovely, the food was OK and we certainly didn't feel tired on arrival due to the 787 but what a squeeze.

" Kuwait to Cape Town via Doha. I am stuck in an airport lounge in Nairobi. A seemingly routine flight from Kuwait to Cape Town has turned into this three day fiasco. On 8th June I booked in as per normal at Kuwait Int Airport. Proceeded to the departure gates and waited to board the plane. The flight at first was delayed, no announcement or information was given. Only when fellow travelers started to get annoyed about the situation did Qatar staff try to explain. We were to sit and wait, .no explanation. After 2 hours of waiting we were told there are technical issues with the plane. Again told to just wait. Another hour passed and we were told to go the transfer desk, massive confusion at the transfer desk as the staff did not know what was going on. Again we were told to wait, then two options, we wait till they fix the aircraft or take the next flight the next morning. I was then booked on a flight to Nairobi and was told all has been taken care of and that I will be connected with the next flight from Nairobi to Cape Town. Only to arrive in Nairobi and nothing of such was done. The crew in Kuwait did not issue the ticket correctly which led to the crew in Nairobi not being able to issue me with the connecting ticket, making me miss the last flight out to Cape Town. Then I was told failing that they can put me on a flight from Nairobi to JNB and then to CPT. That was 4 hours ago, no one informs or keep one updated. Turns out I won't be on the flight to JNB. I will be booked into a hotel and put on the first flight out in the morning? I am disappointed with this airline. There was no attempt to rectify, or defuse the situation...

" Houston to Bangkok via Doha, the two flights in Q Suites were the best business class I have ever experienced. Check in at IAH terminal D is not in an ideal location. First impression, chaos. There were plenty of staff greeting passengers and getting each customer to an agent, turning chaos into order. The agent made eye contact and focused on getting me on my way. Their lounge is shared with several carriers. Food included vegetarian options was not bad. The seating is just okay. The flight was delayed due to the aircraft arriving later. Announcements were audible and clear in the gate area. Boarding was special. US ICE agents lined the jetway asking questions and making us feel really special. A flight attendant at the door showed me to my seat and offered a pre-departure drink. Crew appearance was sharp and professional. Sincere smiles lead me to believe they enjoy their jobs. Qatar offers dinning on demand in business class. I choose to eat right after departure to sleep on this 14 hour flight. My meal was special order vegetarian and was fresh and good, not great. I enjoyed a Grand Cru Pauillac. The Flight Attendant offered turn down service and he draped my seat with light bedding. In flat sleeping position the seat is wide and has generous width including space for my feet. I was able to sleep 9 hours in peace with the suite door closed. The space inside my suite was more than ample. Easy storage of all personal items. The IFE Screen is large and HD noise cancelling head phones are provided. I didn't find the selection up to the tech, but you can upload files to play using USB or near field connections. Service was friendly and prompt throughout the flight.

However, if you expect to select a seat when booking your ticket with them and actually flying on that seat, forget it. They push you back on the cabin for whatever excuse. Why allow you to select a seat when booking the flight if you will never honour it at check-in? I fly with them to Doha for work every other month but I guess this May 2018 will be the last. Great aircraft and facilities and very good crew but atrocious check-in personnel at LHR (polite but useless) and the worst customer service team I have ever experienced.",Passive
" I flew on upgraded business class on Qatar Airways from Shanghai to Stockholm via Doha (return). What a treat!! The entire experience was amazing. The service on board is impeccable. You couldn't really compare it to other airlines' business class. It is definitely better than BA first class experience. Since my class was an upgraded one, I didn't have access to the Al Mourjan lounge at DOH. But I got access to it since the other lounges were full on my first transfer. On my second transfer, I purchased access to Al Mourjan (450 QAR = 125 USD). It was worth every penny since my layover was more than 5 hours. My last leg Doha to Shanghai was in a Q-suite on a B777. Amazing. I loved it and I loved the service. I can't even imagine how Qatar Airways manages to maintain this level of service. It's really a treat for ones soul and body. Many people complain about the lost access to the Al Mourjan lounge on upgraded tickets. Of course its a shame not to spend the layover at that lounge but considering the quality of the food and drinks you get at that lounge, I think QR went back on me paying the 125 USD entrance fee.",Promoter
" Denpasar to Paris via Doha. Overall a very good experience. First flight from Bali to Doha on the 777 was with their old business class offering. Seats are big and comfortable, however are angled flat beds and not completely flat. Travelling with my partner and a toddler the seat was wide enough for my son to sleep beside me which was a huge bonus. Food on this flight was excellent along with an excellent cabin service from the staff on board. I did not use the entertainment system and slept for most of the 10 hour flight so cannot comment on this. The second leg from Doha to Paris was again on a 777 but this time we had the QSuite. Having flown on many different carriers business offering this is by far the best I have seen. We took the 2 centre seats which when converted to flat created a double bed. Having this when travelling with a young child was a huge help. The suites offer maximum privacy and create a sense that you are flying alone. Seats are very comfortable, IFE excellent with large HD screen and lots of viewing options. Food again was very good with lots of options to choose from. Once again the staff were some of the best I have experienced in the sky and nothing was too much trouble for them. Overall Qatar offer probably the best business product I have flown and would not hesitate to book them again. The others have some catching up to do.",Promoter

 Johannesburg to Doha. We were a family of four in Business Class and we had 6 kgs overweight but the Johannesburg station manager would not overlook it. Then came the worst boarding process I have ever seen. The food was inedible as the catering choices from Johannesburg is bad.

" Adelaide to Manchester via Doha. Two flights which could not have been more different. Adelaide to Doha on A350, comfortable and spacious seats, good entertainment system and fantastic crew. Also pre selected vegetarian meals which were very acceptable. Crew on this flight were attentive, smiling and courteous all the way. Doha to Manchester on Boeing 787 was cramped, uncomfortable with terrible entertainment system and miserable crew. On boarding this flight the crew were directing passengers down the wrong aisles causing frustration and back ups. During the flight they appeared tired and uninterested with little customer interaction. Probably one of the worst flights I've had with this usually excellent airline.",Passive
" The departure from Kuwait was delayed by 1 hour. Crew apologized for the delay but this reduced my time in exploring Al-Mourjan lounge in Doha. From Doha to Singapore neither the map or onboard camera were working on the A350. Crew on both sectors were fabulous, however, IFE and seat comfort (1x2x1 layout) is a joke. Wi-Fi was unavailable for my flight to Singapore. On the way back to Kuwait my seat IFE was malfunctioning so they changed my prefer preassigned seat to another seat, thus causing me inconvenience. Food and service was fabulous but I would not fly Qatar Airways again.",Detractor

At my assigned seat, ground staff came into the flight to ask me for my luggage tags and went out for a few minutes before returning back to the flight to tell me ok luggage is in. Before boarding my flight from Doha to Singapore, I asked if my luggage is on the flight but the person on the counter scolded me for holding on to my husband's flight ticket saying that he should hold it himself cause I might lose it. On the flight, I saw that my chicken dish had some aluminium foil still on it. They staff said sorry and said they would write report and gave me fruits. Entertainment system had to be rebooted during the flight lasting over ten minutes.",Detractor
" London to Ho Chi Minh City via Doha. One of the most uncomfortable flights in many years, found the seat width and most importantly depth very small. The service from the cabin staff was very good. We had a passenger sat next to us that was constantly clearing his throat and spitting into a bag from Heathrow to Doha. Unfortunately the cabin staff were unable to dissuade this awful habit. On the leg from Doha to Ho Chi Minh the seats were worse - again the staff were exceptional. The meals on both legs of the journey were catered for a certain pallet type which is expected but not helpful. Overall I would hold the aircraft staff at the top of airlines flown with but the seating and food could be so much better.",Passive
" Doha to Bangkok was one of the best flights ever I had. I was already knowing the cabin of The Boeing 787, so the space was as usual pretty nice and ok. The food was really spicy and full of ingredients so I did not touch it too much. The cabin crew was really patient, polite, and they were really helpful in curating the details, from each guests. It turne out that I forgot my amenity kit at home. As it was a night flight, I asked a member from the cabin crew and she said there were not any available in economy anymore, but she gave the chance to have one from Business class, which I was just in love because of the Brics design. She was so polite, and talented and she was just four months with Qatar Airways, she really made my flight and all my 24h journey. IÂ´m pretty sure she will make a good job and these are the way to create proud and loyal customers.",Promoter

She was rude . Luckily the cabin crew were better and more helpful, but not outstanding, they did not know what was inside the snack they were offering. The cleanliness, space from the aircraft were really good and I loved the flight as well the IFE. If you are flying the Boeing 787 donÂ´t sit too much in the back otherwise you will see more the wing than the sky.",Passive
" Edinburgh to Bangkok via Doha. Excellent service, which I have now come to expect from Qatar. They outshine in almost every aspect. One gripe however, is the check in at Edinburgh, which may be managed by One World. This was seriously bad. It took 30 minutes to check in, with 2 passengers in front of me. The staff seem to have no experience in checking passengers in, and they were constantly transferring priority luggage tags, lounge invitations etc between two desks, as if there was no preparation. We were then informed that there was no Fast Track (FT) for security clearance, but when we pointed out to the gate keeper that we were members of OneWorld, they allowed us to proceed through FT. Not sure why Qatar is not listed as a user of FT for its Business Class travellers. Onboard service was impeccable, with professional, efficient and pleasant staff, which is truly noteworthy. Wifi connectivity did not appear to work on the several times I attempted to use it.",Promoter
" Bangkok to Edinburgh via Doha. Impressive service from beginning to end. The new lounge at BKK is a huge improvement on the previously shared lounge with THAI. Every encounter with Qatar staff was professional and based on the highest level of training.

 Flew Qatar Airways from Colombo to Amsterdam via Doha. Check-in took ages even at the online bad drop counter. What's the purpose of this whole exercise of online checking if it does not minimize the fuss at the airport. Onboard did not see many smiles on the crew faces.

" Hong Kong to Dublin via Doha. An evening service using Boeing 777 on first leg and Boeing 787 from Doha. Check-in was quick and efficient in both airports. Seat 3K (right window) on B777 was comfortable and spacious. Flight attendants were friendly, and addressed me by name. Qatar offer dining on demand, and my excellent dinner arrived when requested. From the menu, lobster stood out, but it was not available. The FA saw my disappointment, and twice during the flight the purser came to apologise. The beef replacement was excellent. Food overall was probably the best I have had on an airplane. Wine was also really good. Couldn't fault the service, with a nice amenity kit, including Georgio Armani after shave balm, after shave, and lots of moisturisers, lip balm etc. Pyjamas are also supplied and it was easy to get 6 hours good sleep. IFE was good, with a reasonable selection, and an excellent moving map display, including simulated head-up display and instrument panel. First leg arrived on time, and then all change to the Boeing 787. Service on to Dublin was of a similar standard, and the breakfast omelette, which came after a nice fruit selection and cereal, was very tasty. The interesting thing here is the comparison between the B777 and 787. The 787's seat (2K window seat), is angled so you have no-one beside you. The Boeing 787 windows are just huge, and are electronically dimmed. Cabin lighting is very sophisticated, but I have to say that overall I was a little disappointed with the Boeing 787. The seat is not as spacious or comfortable as the older 777, and the IFE is decidedly fiddly and unfriendly to use. I could see several passengers needing assistance with it, and the FA's couldn't figure it out either. The moving map display was different also, and strangely for a newer airplane, it was much more basic, and missed most of the nice features available on the 777. Overall, I have to say that Qatar offer an incredibly good service, with amazing food, great staff, a modern fleet, and very comfortable lounges, particularly in Doha. I would seek them out actively in preference to the other middle eastern airlines, and that is really saying something.",Promoter
" Birmingham to Manila via Doha. Check in at Birmingham was very quick and easy and was given fast track security, although in Birmingham this is pretty badly organised! The lounge is a 3rd party lounge called No.1, which is quite nice and modern inside and with reasonable amount of seating tables etc. Because it is a lounge which you can pay to use they limit how much hot food you can have which is a shame as the portions are not large, although it was actually delicious. Boarding was easy and quick and my amenity kit was already in my seat and I was immediately offered a welcome drink. All crew on board were fantastic throughout the flight. Food and drinks including presentation was more akin to a first class product really. The seat in the 787 is the excellent herringbone config and was very comfortable and with a lot of storage and table space. At Doha I did not have long to change planes so did not have time to enjoy the lounge. On the 777 the service was just as excellent, I didn't sample the dinner as I went straight to sleep but the breakfast was excellent and the dine in demand meant that it could fit around when I woke up and I wanted to eat, an amazing plus! The 777 was an older one with the old 2-2-2 config which actually isn't too bad, the seat and bed are both comfortable although as I am quite tall I much prefer a seat with a separate food stool. There is fairly good storage space although limited table space. Regarding IFE, whilst the 787 has a newer system, I actually found the 777 system more responsive and easier to use and the quality was still really good! Overall an outstanding flight and very good value for money. Being able to collect BA points and avios was an added bonus.",Promoter
" Johannesburg to Edinburgh via Doha. Qatar Airways provides a decent service with their flights, but other areas are lacking. You can choose your seats online if you booked with them, which is useful without paying an extra charge. The seats were too narrow in my opinion and leg room was not too generous. Service by the cabin staff was good. The in flight entertainment was okay. Some recent new movies were the highlight. The screen is not very high quality and headphones supplied had to have its connection moved around to work properly, which was not a good experience at all and this happened on my recent flights with them. I was disappointed with the food quantities and frequency. The main meals for breakfast and supper (somehow never got lunch) are very small, notwithstanding that there are some other small accompaniments. The choices of were only basically chicken or vegetarian. The problem that I had with how often meals were served was particularly on one of my connecting flights to Doha, which started boarding at 12:45. They did not serve lunch and instead served supper at 16:00 and in the evening, they only served their tiny hot sandwich, which is a small rectangular pie and a tiny cupcake. As a result, I was very hungry throughout the flight. On arrival to my final destination, my suitcase was also damaged, with two sharp metal parts sticking out from the bottom and when I inquired about it at the baggage desk, they refused to even acknowledge that there was any damage and were quite frankly rude. This was ridiculous.",Detractor
" My wife and I had booked a return trip Adelaide to Frankfurt via Doha over Easter. A few days before departure Qatar offered an upgrade to Business Class for the 2 legs and we decided to upgrade for about $2500 for Adelaide Doha. This was well worth it, we ate well, our Romanian our flight attendant was excellent and attended to our every need and I managed to sleep about 9 hours. The next leg, Doha to Frankfurt was only 6 hours and it passed uneventfully but in Economy Class. Our return flight, about 12 days later from Frankfurt to Doha passed quickly as well. On the nearly 14 hour flight from Doha to Adelaide we each had a row of seats. The A350 which Qatar uses for the 14 hours long haul, has a 3x3x3 configuration which made sleeping possible. But economy class food left a lot to be desired. I was served lamb in apricot sauce which was so dry that I think they forgot about the sauce. For the brunch I opted for the Cheddar Cheese scrambled egg and this was also very dry . However, the desserts served were of a good enough standard. Boeing 777 middle row of 4 seats is very squeezy by comparison to the A350 and there is little space for 8 legs and feet. The flight attendants were friendly and efficient.",Promoter

The ground staff made no announcements about the delay for over two hours. They only made one when I finally trudged up to the small, packed, outdated gate area and told them they needed to. Then, a chaotic boarding commenced that was a free-for-all. In DOH, I missed my connection by a half hour or so. There was no ground staff there with information on my flight to Kigali, I had to go to their transfer desk to get vouchers for the stay in Doha. Next morning the immigration was woefully understaffed. It took 1 hour to clear immigration because there were a couple of disinterested workers and hundreds of passengers needing to get through. Security screening can be hit and miss. Things allowed through some times, next time they are taken.",Passive

Qatar as a country suffers tremendously from the Arab ban/embargo put on them from their neighbours causing increased food prices and for QR it implies huge deroutings on most African and S-American destinations (add up to 3 hours per leg!). FAs are the best in the air, always focused, energetic, proactive, attentive, and committed, and hardworking. Rarely â€“ if ever? Have I seen better FAs.

" Booked a 15 day day food tour of India, starting from New Delhi and ending up at Goa, Qatar Airways offered the best route. Manchester to Doha was on the B787-8, cabin crew were pleasant in particular the head purser who was apologetic and showed empathy as they did not have my food choice by the time she reached me. The passenger next but one to me, was argumentative as he did not get his food choice as well, she handled the situation extremely well. She explained to the passenger that number of food choice is governed by projected demand and supply. This happened to me again from Goa to Doha, again the cabin crew was apologetic and and showed empathy. From Doha to Manchester, luckily I was seated near the front and therefore had choice of food, and they provided numerous drinks run throughout the flight. I would give this airline 10 out of 10, but only going got give it 8 out of 10 due to not having my choice of food.

" Flew Qatar Airways from Oslo to Doha. The business cabin on the B787 planes is at the front of the plane, since there is no first class. At the second door a small onboard self-service bar is in place where champagne, wine and snacks are provided during the flight. Two additional seats can be found behind the bar and between the toilets, these are not recommended. Due to the small cabin (compared to the A380 cabins) the atmosphere is much warmer and the staff can pay more attention to passengers. The overhead compartments are missing above the middle seats that makes the cabin more spacious, but middle seat passengers must use the storage above the window seats. Usually it is not a problem, the space is still enough, but I felt uncomfortable in disturbing others by opening the storage above them. The 1-2-1 herringbone configuration seats provide great comfort and space, they are like first class seats at some other airlines. They can be converted to a full-flat bed, however some may find the leg space limited. The screen is large enough and the noise cancellation headsets close out every disturbance. Since it was a day flight, pajamas were only available upon request. The service was excellent and Qatar Airways' on-demand a'la carte menu allows passengers to meal whenever and whatever they wish. Before take-off the flight attendants book the meal requests and the preferred time of the serving, then they return when time comes. Of course passengers can change their mind anytime but it is worth booking the meals in advance to ensure they do not run out. In my case they ran out of Hungarian desert wine Tokaji but substituted with an Australian one. The meals were delicious, but not show-stopping.

But still, they are well ahead of most business seats of other airlines. The onboard service was excellent and smooth.

" Doha to Atlanta. When checking in in Atlanta despite telling the agent we were going to stop in Doha she checked our bags to Kathmandu. The agent had to have her supervisor correct the error. The same happened in Kathmandu despite my very clear instructions that we were going to Doha. When I saw that incorrect bag tags had been printed she was quite rude telling me that I should have told her that we were only going to Doha. Doha airport has been built to a very high standard, there is a train to take passengers to the gates, however arriving passengers must walk to the terminal. Admittedly almost everyone on both flights into Doha were in transit. We were not. The passport process was very poor. At least an hour wait on both occasions. There are 36 immigration gates, of which no more than five were manned. After the first stay in Doha we found the check-in process for our flight to Kathmandu relatively simple. I'm OneWorld sapphire member, and the process worked OK. Qatar Airways has a lounge that permits entry to OneWorld members and we were able to enjoy a breakfast before joining the flight to Kathmandu. After the second stay in Doha we had to checkin at a special area for passengers travelling to the USA. We later learnt on return to the US that our miles from Doha to Atlanta did not appear in our AA accounts. Of the 45 minutes we expected to have in the Qatar Airways lounge to have breakfast we had just 20 minutes before we were called to the gate. Passengers with computers or iPads were sent to a special security area and devices checked and placed in sealed plastic bags which could not be opened until on board the aircraft. My wife's iPad is in a very tightly fitting leather protective case. The security people insisted that this had to be removed which proved very difficult. The leather case was never examined and just returned to her, so what that proved I have no idea. All this additional security meant that the flight departed Doha late and in turn arrived late in Atlanta. The food on Qatar Airways is very basic.

QR905 delayed due to mechanical ex Melbourne, no info from QR, relied on Qantas lounger updates, probably a visit from uniformed QR staff to lounge would have been in order, finally boarded 3 hours late which meant missed connecting flight to LHR. QR had me overnighting in hotel to take direct flight DOH-DUB next day, however after much debate with ground team they put me on another flight to LHR 6 hours later, which that ended up delayed, would have missed connecting flight to DUB so full circle and I went to hotel and took direct flight next day. Transfers all arranged and voucher for meals, can't fault the disruption service. Service on MEL -DOH was average, no interaction from the male FA. Service can border on robotic, very impersonal. Seat comfortable, like the lounge behind business class, great place to stretch out. I found the cabin too hot,Wifi very slow and patchy, the free MB goes in seconds. Flexible airfare so premium price paid. QR still far superior to majority of other airlines, just need to improve the ground staff support, will continue to fly with them.",Passive
" Johannesburg to Houston via Doha. Ground Crew not friendly. Allowed 2 suitcases at 23kg and one carry on. We only had one checked baggage and one carry on each, so below by one checked baggage. Because my CPAP bag was temporary on top of the Carry on they wanted me to pay extra. I explained that I can take my Medical bag off and an argument by the staff started. Eventually a Supervisor intervened and commonsense kicked in. The crew onboard were far from friendly except for the JNB to DOH that flight was as all flights should be, friendly and with good friendly service. Entertainment screen was only 8 inches away from my face. Most of the time my entertainment system didn't work by the Touch Screen or by the Hand Control. Main food meal was tasty and good but snack food tasted awful. Water was regularly offered throughout all flights.",Detractor
" Frankfurt to Ho Chi Minh City via Doha. This was a pleasant trip with Qatar Airways. All the cabin crew members were friendly and attentive. Plenty of drinks were offered, and when we asked for anything the crew went the extra mile to fulfil our wishes. One of our B773ER planes and the A330 still had the old Oryx One entertainment system with a low-resolution screen - the newer entertainment systems on the other planes were excellent! Especially the flight in their B787 was very comfortable, even in economy class. The A330 cabin was rather dated, they should retrofit these planes with newer seats. The food was excellent compared to other economy products. Transfer in Doha was smooth. The only issue on this trip were the rude and incompetent local airport ground staff at SGN who conducted check-in for Qatar Airways: they enforced the weight limits for baggage down to the last gram, as strictly as for any low-cost carrier. I canâ€˜t imagine Qatarâ€˜s own staff to be that stringent on weight limits.",Promoter
" This was my first long haul economy flight in a decade. After been fortunate enough to fly in the front quite often I was on a money saving effort and so did London Heathrow to Sydney return via Doha in economy. I scored a great fare in their annual January sale. I found the service was very good on all flights. I was in the upper deck economy cabin at the back and found the crew to be pleasant and also very responsive whenever I asked for another drink. The legroom was about as good as it will get in economy, which is to say it wasn't complete torture. It's up there with the best. The inflight entertainment was sufficiently diverse to occupy me for four long flights, with a mix of older and very new releases. I'd say one of the better systems. Oneworld sapphire and emerald members are treated as second class citizens. Staff were falling over themselves for a QR silver member (OW Ruby) on one leg of my journey which I found odd. This was until I realised that in Doha if you fly economy you don't have access to the regular business class lounge but a second tier lounge. Having experienced the Al Mourjan lounge previously I can say the Qatar business class lounge is less superior (think run of the mill AA lounge in the US). Overall the experience as a Sapphire or Emerald member doesn't matter to Qatar. I had heard that upper deck economy is reserved for premium fliers - this is incorrect. You will get first dibs on the seats, but then it's open season once online check-in opens. On my DOH-LON flight the lower deck was a third full whilst the upper deck was 3/4 full. I found the food revolting, particularly noteworthy was a chicken biryani from DOH to SYD. But it's economy so you get what you pay for I guess. Overall I would definitely pay for Qatar in business class, but an indirect route in economy is not something I'll be seeking out again. No matter how you dress it up economy is economy.",Passive
" Barcelona to Melbourne via Doha. Plane, we have now flown twice on 787's and each time it has been a disappointment. The seats feel cramped and narrow when compared to the A380 which is flown in the second leg. The entertainment system is difficult to navigate and the volume is particularly difficult to control. The seats are difficult to move from reclined back straight. 5/10 Service was ok but not at the top of the market when compared to Singapore, Cathay or even Qantas. I wished to change the food order for the children but the hostess made only a brief attempt to find alternative meals and then never came back to let me know definitively that no meals were available. 5/10 Food: Very average meals, serves are small and generally would advise steering clear of European style meals. Indian meals taste better. 5/10 Overall disappointing compared to competitors.",Passive
" Copenhagen to Bangkok via Doha. These two flights had both good and bad. Copenhagen to Doha, the seat on the 787 is far superior to that of the old style seat on some 777. However the food was bad , the chicken was inedible and the crew were noisy in the galley. The lounge experience in Doha was again, exemplary. The staff are so friendly and the waiter service and a la carte menu impressive. Boarding for the BKK sector was a bit of a scrum, they could make the priority lane more prominent. It was literally a case of pushing through passengers trying to board. Doha-Bangkok sector and the crew couldn't have been more different from their colleagues on the Copenhagen sector. For such an early morning departure they were friendly and had a genuine warmth. Food was much better, supper was delivered speedily after take off, and the pancakes for breakfast were delicious. The one thing that lets down QR on the old 777 are the seats, it was uncomfortable to sleep on, but I was so tired I managed a few hours. All in all though a much more positive experience than my previous flights with QR.",Promoter
" Doha to Paris CDG. One of the best flights I have taken, the service was personal and professional the cabin staff attentive and gracious, the food was good though not exceptional, the tenderloin was overdone for my taste. Arabic mezze was a little bland and needed more lemon and olive oil. The entertainment system was lacking in selection though the movies were up to date but lacked in classics, the TV selection was very poor. The WiFi was OK and the seat on the Qatar Airways A350 are some of the best in the business .",Promoter

The crew was friendly and attentive, from Frankfurt to Doha even exceptionally friendly and efficient. The food was nicely presented but not many choices. If you like a very rich soup and a nice curry, you will enjoy it. But on both flights we got pretty much the same dishes, a boring and disappointing experience. I tried to sleep on both flights, which was impossible, the so-called flat bed is not really flat in the 777 and is divided in 4 sections, one of the most uncomfortable experiences in last years.",Detractor

" Birmingham to Melbourne via Doha. After leaving a few comments regarding my outward flight from Melboure to Birmingham, Qatar contacted me for further details and ensured me my return trip would be different. Well it was like chalk and Cheese. Everything I was disappointed about on my outward flight was addressed and the cabin crew went above and beyond to ensure I had a awesome return flight. Cannot say enough about Qatar customer service and Cabin crew. A great airline who want to continually improve by listening to customers. I am not a serial moaner and travel frequently to the UK and back. Previously I have experienced poor service with Emirates and followed the complaints/comments procedure. Still waiting for a reply over 2 years ago, which shows clearly the difference between these two airlines.",Promoter
" Kigali to Ho Chi Minh City via Doha on 27-28 Febr. 2018. Punctual flights, uneventful. 3 hours scheduled additional time delay avoiding overflying Saudia Arabia. FAs are excellent â€“ world-class. Annoying announcements â€“ many of them superfluous. They continue their charity propaganda for Educate a Child â€“ that really puzzles me. How naÃ¯ve are we passengers to blindly support financially some glossy outlayed institution without providing neutral facts? The 2nd flight left 02 a.m. and did hardly have any food for business class. No real hot dishes â€“ no fish, no meat, only cold piece salmon was offered. They offered a beef filet which was only a spoon of rice with some shredded meat in a heavy brown sauce. No chilli, no fishsauce, no ginger, no icecream, no nothing. I was only saved by an alert FA who managed to secure me a reasonable meal of fish from economy class. Never experienced this before when travelling in business class. Seats in these A330 aircraft are lie flat but narrow that your feet are squeezed if stretching the legs out into a tiny hole under the seat in front. Paid by far too much for this ticket. However, luggage and lounge access functioned well.",Passive

" London to Melbourne via Doha. I found an excellent fare with Qatar so I had to give them a go. My flight from London was delayed by nearly 2 hours, however when I checked in I was offered to be moved to the earlier flight (which was about to board). I accepted and for my troubles I was given an exit row on my first flight and an entire row to myself on the second. Qatar economy has nearly 2 extra inches on most other airlines and you can tell. As someone who is only 5ft 10 I had more than enough room on the second leg. Service is generally very good, however the food and drink selections are a little basic compared to Emirates, offering only Red label scotch, Smirnoff vodka and Beefeater gin. Food was just okay. The IFE was good, without being great, offering largely B-list films with 2 or 3 blockbusters. Qatar offers 10 minutes/10mb of free WiFi which is basically enough to check your Twitter, then 30 minutes for $6USD. It's a nice touch, but very steep compared to Emirates flight long Wi-Fi for $1USD. Overall, if bad scotch and average movies don't bother you, Qatar is for you. Easily my new second favourite airline.",Promoter
" Islamabad to Montreal via Doha. While there is always a risk of delayed flights & connections in long haul flights, it is the way tough situations get handled that set an airline apart. Qatar Airways did an emergency landing in Moscow (a person onboard was sick) on my flight from Doha to Montreal. What ensued was a comedy of errors. They made people wait for 5 hours, did not have any game plan to provide accommodation when we got back to Doha (they took us back). My connecting domestic flight was missed, the accommodation they arranged in Montreal was extremely shoddy.",Detractor
" Chicago to Hyderabad via Doha. I travelled along with my 4 months old son and my mother on Jan 22nd. First I need to tell about my bad experience with other airlines then only you will understand my wonderful experience with Qatar Airways. We booked online to travel on Jan 21st from Canton, Ohio to Chicago through American Airlines, from Chicago to Hyderabad via Doha but AA flight got delayed for several hours and they don't know how much time it takes, they were keep on changing AA flight time, later we realized it's impossible to catch connecting flight in Chicago (we already wasted several hours while waiting), so we discussed with AA staff, they took almost 4 hours and finally they said we have to rebook tickets to next day and they cannot rebook through Qatar but said they can rebook with BA (British Airways) for next day ie. Jan 22nd from Cleveland to Chicago through AA flight and from Chicago to India through BA flight. I agreed for that because we don't have any other feasible options at that time. On Jan 22nd we were able to flew from Cleveland to Chicago in AA flight but in Chicago BA staff did not allow me to board in BA flight because they said I don't have unexpired US visa (I already have H4 approval petition but don't have unexpired US visa and already scheduled for visa appointment in India). I did not know that I need a visa to travel in BA and AA staff who changed our entire itinerary (it supposed to be with Qatar Airways but changed to BA) never told us about visa restrictions with BA even though we spent 4 hours in their counter while standing. BA staff were very rude in Chicago, did not help us in any way. I was worried about what happens next and how to take care of my 4 months old son and my mother who does not speak English, more over Chicago is not my home town and don't know anyone there. Then I got an idea to meet with Qatar staff because Qatar Airways was my original airline, wanted to give a try, then my fate changed entirely. I encountered with Qatar Airways staff and my experience with them was wonderful and they rebooked our tickets with the Qatar flight which will be starting with in 40 minutes from Chicago without asking for single penny. Qatar Airways staff acted very fast, cleared all formalities within minutes and believe it or not within 30 minutes we were in the flight. I still cannot believe how Qatar Airways staff helped us, the way they treated us, cleared everything in minutes and handled the situation especially when we need a help very badly and with very bad experience earlier with other airlines (AA and BA) even though we approached them in last minute. I am very much thankful to Qatar Airways staff otherwise I would have suffered a lot especially with my 4 months old son and my mother, both completely depends on me. I wanted to take some time to put all my experiences, that's why I am putting little bit late review.",Promoter
" Singapore to Berlin via Doha. The ground service in Singapore were not up to the standard I expected. Food on board, I understand that there is limited choice. However the system serving food is weird, I was surprised being in the middle of the plane and finding out that the row behind me was served 40 minutes before me. So at the end as the last people who were served we didn't had a choice of the food. The cabin crew were nice, polite and friendly. They tried their best even if the company didn't provide them enough of tools to make their work excelent. The last issue was getting back my bag. I was in shock when i get my suitcase damaged. I went and reported it right away, I got report and everything was alright. At Tegel Airport I was informed that i have to call company DOLFI that works with Qatar Airways to solve the issue. That's what i did and here i got another suprise! Lady on the phone told me that she can't help me i have to contact airline. I did as she said, customer service informed me that they don't deal with this kind of cases and i have to contact airport crew. Again nice airport manager send me back to DOLFI. And finally everything ends here after 1 month. The issue of suitcase was solved, however it was such a poor service, staff in DOLFI is not informed about their duties, which cause misunderstanding. I'm happy everything ended well. Qatar Airways rectified their mistake and I got new suitcase in similar color.",Passive

Doha to London Heathrow left on time. Plane was full, again an aisle seat, legroom OK for a tall person but aisle was very narrow as Qatar has a 3-4-3 configuration on Boeing 777.

" Chicago to Doha. I saw the ticket agent physically deflate when my large piece of luggage came in under the weight requirements. Their luggage handling is infuriating. The 10 across seating in the 777 economy is offering narrow 17"" wide seats. Seat recline is better than most, which can cut both ways - comfortable for sleeping, but if the person in front of you reclines the entire flight, you won't have room to work on your laptop. That doesn't matter much as the 777s don't have wifi. The entertainment choices are excellent, but the screens are old, tired, unintuitive, and not particularly responsive. The flight tracking maps are useless, flashing from a screen showing an ad to a screen showing the pitch of the aircraft, to a sparse map written in only Arabic. To give credit where it's due, they mostly nail the food. Three entree choices, and enough on your tray to constitute a meal. If you're used to US airlines, you'll be pleasantly surprised at the amount and quality of food provided. Finally, the connections at the Doha airport are a special kind of punishment, it's a massive facility filled with every high end retailer in the world. I wouldn't go too far out of my way to avoid Qatar Airways, but they've been gliding on their grammatically painful world five star airline motto for far too long.",Detractor

Marrakech to Doha had the type of cabin crew for which US and low grade European airlines are better known. Doing the minimum, serving a meal in a totally indifferent way, then disappearing behind a curtain not to be seen for the remainder of the flight. The bar counter at the back of the Business cabin was left depleted and dirty, not once in over 4 hours did the crew check on passengers and enquire about drinks. Only during the last hour or so did they reappear to offer, unenthusiastically, drinks or snacks.

Very bad attitude from their check-in staff, no welcome at all or reply to my greeting, I asked politely the baggage limit to be barked that it's 1 piece, and no reply when I politely stated that I was after the weight limit (I still don't know the weight limit, my baggage was 25kg so above that). The check-in girl sat staring at my passport for 4-5 minutes, then asked me if I had any other ID. Then with passport in hand she kept reaching for the phone and dialling numbers, without telling me what was going on. This was at 6am, she eventually got hold of her supervisor who came over and said the visa was fine. Any questions I asked where answered with ""Thats just the way it is"" again and again.

" Travelled 21 & 22 Jan 2018 with Qatar Airways from Ho Chi Minh via Doha to Entebbe and Kigali. Reliable airline, punctual flights, world class service, good drinks, poor food with no diversity, small portions, clean, newer aircrafts. Good lounge in Doha with slumber rooms. Luggage transferred with high precision. Terrible bus-gating in Doha: have to walk inside the airport for almost 2 km, for them just to board by taking a bus drive for another 3 km: why don't they then bus people from the central area and drive all 5 km instead of letting everybody walk 2 km first? Elite status respected: staff were very respectful and advising. Very expensive ticket, double price as compared to competing carriers on this route (like ET and KQ). Due to the Arab ban on Qatar, a huge deroute from DOH to East Africa was undertaken to avoid flying over Saudi-Arabia. It consumes 2 hours extra travel. Another 2 hours was added for an un-announced stop in Entebbe. Altogether the flight became a full day flight while it should have been Â½ day flight. Will change carrier next time but accepted this price to retain flyer status at their FFP. Lousy and expensive WiFi offered on-board with lots of patronising registration and information requirements.

A little more expensive than other airlines in the region, but they fly point to point rather than hubs and transfers, which I prefer.

On previous flights, I had twice tried to sign on to Qatar's frequent flyer programme, but somehow this did not work out. I had wanted to deposit my need for an aisle seat, as I have a back injury which requires me to get up frequently. On the flight from Doha to Bangkok I was assigned a seat with which there was something wrong. I requested that I be allowed to change the seat, explaining that I might get problems, but was told that this was impossible as the plane was full. In Bangkok, I had to request another passenger to lift my luggage off the belt at the airport. I needed to leave Bangkok eight days earlier than booked. The ticket I had bought stated that I would be charged 173 Swiss francs for any change of reservation, but when I tried to make the change online, the cost was given as 355 Swiss francs. I called the Qatar office in Bangkok. They confirmed that this was a mistake, ""probably a software problemâ€œ, and then proceeded to charge me 202 Swiss francs.

" Melbourne to Geneva via Doha and Marrakesh to Melbourne on return. Despite good ground service in Geneva and Marrakesh, service was shocking in Qatar. Despite arriving into Qatar from Melbourne with an hour to spare we were not able to board the flight due to their systems. Continued confusion at the airport (after queuing for 20 minutes) meant we were told 3 times we would make the flight, only to be told in the end that we could not. They did re-route us via Geneva and London to Edinburgh, but then there was not enough time for the required connection (this was always going to be impossible). So again we had to re-route, this time via a different London flight and on to Aberdeen instead. Our 22 hour journey ended up being through 5 airports, 42 hours long and we didn't manage to have time for one lounge due to all the continued queuing and waiting. As a shorty (5ft 1) the headrests are badly designed. They push my head forward uncomfortably as they don't go low enough. At least the staff got me extra blankets to sit on, which really did help my neck a lot but was not the comfiest for my bum. There is no foot rest, again a problem for me being short. I tried to use my own Bose headphones with a 2 pin adapter as I do on most flights but with only 4 volume settings and the volume down to its lowest it was unbearably loud. I asked for a headset and got through 4 headsets, not one worked properly. One ear only would work on 3 pairs and with the other it was a robotic sound and I could not hear properly. I ended up using my own headphones but only half on my ears. My handset flashed the entire journey which was very offputting. They tried to re-set it 3 times, but it did not help. For one of the legs I was in an exit row and the handsets are next to your hip which meant I kept pressing the buttons without meaning to, interrupting my movie by randomly selecting a game for example. Food and drink I cannot fault - probably the best airline food I've had in economy. Cabin staff service: was much better than ground staff, very amicable and helpful.",Detractor

As a transit passenger connecting to another flight it's a decent airport. Brand new aircraft was awesome, providing lots of room - definitely book this aircraft in future if flying Qatar.",Passive
" Doha to Houston. Qatar's business class service is always good, seats on 772LR could use updates, pillows in J class could be of better quality and the new PJ's don't come in XXL size. The ground handling service and baggage delivery at arrival in Houston is unacceptable, crew bags were delivered first followed by mostly economy class bags and then business class bags. I don't understand how difficult it is to take care of business class customers. Inflight product is great in the premium class. The lounge Qatar uses in Houston not so great and don't understand while they don't use the BA lounge.",Detractor
" Doha to Athens in January 2017. Smooth transfer through Doha Hamad and on time departure. Only downside was use of transfer bus from gate to aircraft instead of a bridge. Food quality and flight entertainment were excellent, as well as choice of beverages (soft drinks, and juices - not interested in alcoholic drinks as I do not consume them!). During the flight a problem arose with the passenger at the front fully reclining his seat. In spite of my polite requests not to fully recline, he became rude and we started arguing. Cabin staff intervened, first with no success, as the guy became abusive towards me and my wife. The head of cabin crew then intervened successfully. We started talking and explained to me airline procedures relating to this sort of situation. At some stage he held a briefing with cabin crew on all flight events and relevant procedures as well as closing the day. I submitted a written commendation regarding cabin crew professionalism on handling of this sort of situation. Really amicable - well done!",Promoter
" Doha to Dubai in January 2017 on business with my wife. Had a fairly smooth transfer at the Hamad International in Doha. The departure gate was a considerable distance from the gate of our arriving flight but signage was clear and using the walkways provided got us to the departure gate on time. Departure on time, welcoming staff quite clean aircraft for a short flight of about an hour. A very tasty chicken sandwich was provided and beverages. In-flight entertainment was on and could be used. I had my own headphones which I did use! A very pleasant airline I would recommend.",Promoter
" Dubai to Doha in January 2017. Excellent ground services, punctual departure from assigned gate. Travelling with my wife on business. Only minus point was that there was no bridge to the aircraft - rather an old-style transfer bus. Staff was courteous on boarding. While on the aircraft, take off and landing were smooth - obviously the pilot was well trained! Food served was a delicious chicken sandwich , as well as beverages - enough considering the flight time is about an hour. In-flight entertainment was on and used my own earphones. Overall, a pleasant experience I would recommend to all!",Promoter
" Flew TXL-DOH-ICN. Berlin to Seoul, December 23 Business Class, 3-hour layover at DOH International, Qatar Airways Al Mourjan Lounge. My first QA flight and they are now my airline of choice. TXL-DOH boarding was a bit disorganized but I put that down to the airport layout. TXL-DOH flight excellent, comfortable seats, entertainment system had many choices and worked perfectly, USB charging port, noise-cancelling headphones, provided with complementary pyjamas, amenity kit, 2 types of champagne, delicious meals, excellent service with a smile. Washrooms clean, new and decently-sized. Debarking and layover at DOH no problem, business lounge is easy to find and is 2 floors, buffet restaurant on 2nd floor, spacious, excellent business center, shower facilities, and quiet areas. DOH-ICN leg (8 hours) was even better, there were only 2 people in business class so we were treated like kings. Arrival on time, debarking was painless. Will definitely fly with them again.",Promoter
" Milan to Jakarta via Doha in October 2017. We boarded the A330-300, staff with friendly smiles and got to our seat 23F which was a window seat, at the seat was IFE, and coat hook but no USB charger. This A330-300 was an older one. We took off on time, the meal service options were roast chicken with potatoes or beef stew, I chose the chicken which wasn't the best. I tried to sleep but due to cramped legroom I couldn't, so I took a walk, I got back to my seat and started to watch the IFE, but it was small but had a lot of options. We landed at Hammad International airport 30 minutes late, had a 2 hour layover before boarding the Boeing 787-8 to Jakarta, again the legroom was cramped but this time the IFE had a USB charger, so I could charge my phone. I woke up just before landing, we landed on time at Jakarta.",Detractor

Thanks to the staff at the check in desk, who was very welcoming, helpful and made our journey so much better by giving us exit row seats on the upper deck. My partner who is very tall loved the extra leg room. I just loved being upstairs where it was a bit quieter and definitely helped me settle my nerves with flying. We were able to sleep and on the second half of our journey the staff were very accommodating. Thank you Qatar Airways, looking forward to flying home.",Promoter
" Doha to Philadelphia. After a 10 hour flight on the Boeing 777-300 I was looking forward to comparing both cabins. I have to say that even tho the A350 is one of my favorite aircrafts because of how much quieter it is and the external camera views that give you a sense of extra safety and peace of mind, I wish the seats were like the ones on the triple seven. The capsule made me feel a bit claustrophobic not to mention that you completely feel far apart from your traveling companion. On the Boeing 777 we were side by side, talking, eating and just loving the flight, on the A350 we felt apart so much so that because the cabin was not full we chose an isle and a window seat (the hallway was between us) but we felt closer. I think Qatar is aware of this and the new Q-Suites will fix this for couples or families that travel together. The tray table is located in a place that during the sleep portion of my 14 hour flight I found myself hitting my knees often. I felt shelled in and at times it was not comfortable. The A350 also has a mini stand in lounge that none used during the flight except for me to actually stretch during portions of the flight. The crew also looked as if they were working with less space than in the triple seven. Qatar's service is the best in the industry so these things I point out just in comparison with the previous equipment flown. I also have to mention that because the same crew had double the passengers to serve they did not spend as much time with you as they did on my previous flight. One thing that is unique to Qatar is their business class affordability if they have the seats to sell the upgrade. On other airlines even if they have the seats they don't give you the opportunity to pay for an upgrade. I booked this 14 hour flight coach and upgraded for $850.00 and trust me the superior service is worth it alone. Qatar has become my airline of choice for international travel.",Promoter
" Manila to Doha. The best traveling experience I've ever had! Qatar airlines is bringing back the glamour and romance of air travel. This flight was 10 hours and we loved every minute of it. You can eat anything from the menu when you want and the crew's attention to detail and genuine friendliness is what makes it all worth it. I prefer the Boeing 777 business cabin over the A350 because you can sit next to your traveling partner, there's less people so the crew really take their time to serve you and attend to your every need plus in my opinion the seat feels a lot more roomier. The check in at the Manila airport was not done by Qatar staff and it was mediocre at best. It felt like I was checked in by robots. This is something that needs to improve. On flights under 10 hours you do not get the pajamas or bed turndown service but despite this I still think Qatar is worthy of their number 1 ranking and is currently the best airline, period.",Promoter
" Melbourne to Larnaca via Doha. My departure flight from Melbourne was late, therefore my connecting flights were missed and had to be rebooked. This resulted in me spending a day and a half in Doha missing the beginning of my tour in Israel. When returning to Melbourne from Amman, Jordan, my ticket was not honoured. I was told that I was not listed, despite having my ticket with seat numbers allocated. I had to repurchase my ticket. On my return home, I contacted my travel agent and Qatar Airways. I found out through my agent that the problem was caused by an administrative error on Qatar Airways part. Qatar Airways never acknowledged my emails and I was forced to claim through my insurance. Qatar Airways did not even have the courtesy of apologising for the error.",Detractor
" Flew Jakarta to Paris via Doha. We arrived at Jakarta Soekarno Hatta International airport T2, where the check-in counter was crowded, my check in experience was slow and very cramped. We boarded our 787-8 on time with nice warm smiles, we took off on time. The legroom was very cramped and it was hard for me to fall asleep, dinner service started with delicious Middle eastern fried rice and mango juice was my drink selection. The IFE was pretty slow but had lots of options. We had a rough landing at Doha, Hamad international airport and had a 2 hour layover before our flight to Paris. We boarded the A380 with even friendlier smiles, we took off on time and had a beautiful scenery view of Doha during take off. Breakfast service started and the options were ""French toast covered in vanilla sauce"" or Omelette, I chose the French toast option and it again was delicious, this time I had coke. I started to watch the IFE again, but this time it was faster and had better options. Soon snack service started and the options were Chicken or Vegetarian puffs, I chose the chicken options and it was delicious again, this time I chose the drink of orange juice. We landed safely in Paris Charles de Gaulle Airport (CDG) on time. The one thing I would like to highlight about Qatar is the amazing food.",Promoter
 Doha to Paris in August 2017. No amenity kit in economy class. The flight attendants told me that amenities are only given on more than 9 hr duration flights and not on a 7 hr daytime flight. Nevertheless in most of the flight the attendants pulled down the window shade. A pitiful breakfast was served and quality and quantity was miserable. Entertainment was average. A very dry snack was given before landing in Paris.,Passive
" Flew from Doha to Manila. I would like to begin this review by saying that Qatar offers a superior product and an outstanding service in economy. The B777-300 is a real workhorse however in economy it feels a bit crowded, to be fair the flight was at capacity and having my first flight be on the A350 it was noticeable how much more crowded the 777 felt. The seat has plenty of legroom, the amenities, the food, the entertainment, and the service, are the best that I have experienced in economy on any airline. Overall Qatar has become my favorite airline because of their modern fleet, their amenities in economy, but overall their superior service.",Promoter
" I would like to begin this review by agreeing that Qatar by far is the best airline I have ever flown. The experience on board in economy was the best I have ever had. In this review I have also attached some photos because there is not too much information about economy and you need to know that if you're considering flying this airline please do so because you will not regret it. The seats are comfortable, the food is very good, the entertainment is also very good but the service is outstanding. The seats in coach have plenty of legroom and this aircraft with the interior LED lighting system, the larger than standard windows, and the quiet engines made this 10 hour flight from Philadelphia to Doha very comfortable. The only thing I must point out is that unfortunately the check in at the Philadelphia airport is not done by Qatar personnel instead by a company that does check in for multiple airlines therefore the experience is not so pleasant, in my opinion this is not fair for the airline because it makes the job of the crew on board more difficult. I will do a separate review about the airport in Doha with detailed information. I have to say that the A350 is probably the best aircraft in the market and Qatar by far the best airline in service, comfort, safety, and value for the money paid. My favorite feature of the A350 has to be the external camera views. Qatar is simply changing the way we fly and I'll fly with them as often as I can and you should to.",Promoter

Upon complaining, they found an excellent, additional sandwich as alternative (Hindu-meal: salmon sandwich), which was good.

" My flight from Sydney to Doha (connecting to Munich) got cancelled due to technical issues after we were sitting in the airplane at the gate for 3 hours. I had to stand in line for another 3 hours to get a hotel for the night. Airport staff took my contact details and I was promised to get informed by the airline about the new departure time. As the airport staff ran out of taxi vouchers, we had to pay for our own taxi to the hotel and were promised to be payed back the next day. I was never informed by any Qatar staff about my new departure time. As the airplane was still broken the next day they had to rebook us on different flights. I had to spend 2,5 hours on the phone to a call centre agent in India who rebooked me on a different routing. At the airport I was not able to claim my taxi money back. After arriving with 20 hour delay in Munich I went to the Qatar Airways office to claim my taxi money back and was given a sheet of paper with an email address where I should write my claim to. I wrote my claim and never got an answer or any money back. After calling the Call centre again, I was told this time that the email address was wrong. So who knows if I will ever be reimbursed.

" Paris to Perth via Doha. We had a very mixed experience with Qatar Airways. The outward journey to Perth was excellent - the seating is very comfortable (better on the A380 than the 777), food was great, and there's a good range of entertainment. Changing planes in Doha was easy although a small issue was that the business class lounge doesn't have enough showers to meet the demand, and we had to wait quite a long time. However, our return journey from Sydney on 19 November was a disaster. We were on the cancelled flight that another passenger has posted about, and I can confirm that Qatar's handling of the situation was chaotic. Once finally off the plane, despite being almost at the front of the queue, we had to wait two hours before we got sent to a hotel. We were told we would be called or emailed with details of a new flight, but we weren't, and all through the next morning it was impossible to get through to their call centre in Australia, and all of the others seemed to be closed.

" London to Sydney via Doha went without hitch and I was happy with the seat, service, lounge etc and would happily have given a 9/10 rating for this airline. However, on the return from SYD to LHR there was a technical problem with the aircraft and after sitting in our seats for two hours the flight was cancelled due to the 11pm curfew at Sydney airport. Total chaos as we had to re-enter immigration, reclaim baggage and pass through customs eventually ending up in the check in area with only four staff members attempting to deal with all 450+ passengers and no separate queue for business and first class passengers. After waiting in line for two hours I was allocated a hotel room and told that Qatar Airways would contact me by telephone with details of onward journey. Finally arrived at hotel at 2.15am. By 10am the following morning I had heard nothing and was due to check out of hotel by 11, together with other passengers who had heard nothing. Numerous calls to the number given for the airline were unanswered and I eventually decided to check my booking online and found that I had been re-booked on a Qantas flight leaving that afternoon. I made my own way to the airport and checked in with no problem but to date, now ten days later, I have had no communication from Qatar Airways. I appreciate that there can be technical difficulties but the total lack of customer service is not what one expects from an airline.",Passive
" I flew from Doha to Guangzhou, business class service has been downgraded comparing with last time I flew Qatar. The new sandwiches bar at Al Mourjan lounge is very good but the same moment they stopped the a la carte menu on the second floor restaurant, it is now a self service buffet, but previous restaurant was unique among all business class lounge. Yes they offer a pre flight booking service, but this is not the book to cook service. Only selection is from the menu of the given flight. On my case, there was not any dinner served, only a sandwich selection, so I had sandwich on the lounge and then sandwich on the plane. Last time I flew a year ago, with the same flight, there was full dinner service. There were not pyjamas on my size and they gave me the biggest they had, a medium/large which I did not use. At least the personnel and the chief crew member were very good. Very efficient and provided very good service beyond expectations, so I have to congratulate them and the airline for their training.",Promoter

" Melbourne to Oslo via Doha, returning from London. I flew on 3 different aircraft with Qatar's business class product and all were consistently amazing. My wife and I flew on the A380 from Melbourne to Doha, the Boeing 787 onto Oslo and A350 out of London before connecting on the A380 back into Melbourne. The 787 was the smallest of Business class but this did not impact the standard or level of service and the seat layout of 1x2x11 is almost identical to the other aircraft. The A350 is about double the size and the A380 would be double that again. 3 out of our 4 flights were overnight and therefor we were able to utilise the lay flat beds, pajamas and noise cancelling headphones to their full advantage. The cabin crew are happy to convert your seat into a bed whilst you get changed in the bathroom. Branded amenity kits are provided. The a la carte menu on all flights was different and you have a wide range of beers and spirits along with a comprehensive international wine and champagne list. First and Business class passengers have the option of boarding first and can enjoy a glass of bubbles .. or two before take off whilst the rest of the plane boards. The A380 also offers the inflight lounge or bar that is for use of First and Business passengers - it allows you a separate space to socialise. There is an impressive cocktail list and a variety of canapes and snacks available too. I can honestly say that I have never experienced such a comfortable flight and the 14 hours to Doha and further 6 hours to Europe went far too quickly. I didn't want to get off the plane. Onboard wifi is available too - 15 mins free or more at a cost if required. The entertainment on board was great and I didn't run out of things to watch or listen too.",Promoter

" Barcelona to Hong Kong return via Doha in business class, and I decided to add my children to the trip (to travel in economy class) about two weeks before the departure. Qatar Airways website would not sell me a ticket for them, so I called their call centre and they were happy to sell me two return economy tickets for my 4 and 7 year old. On arrival at check in at Barcelona the staff realised that the tickets I had been sold for the children were illegal because the younger of the two children was under 5, which they told me is the minimum age on that airline for travel in a cabin separate from the parents. As the flight was leaving in two hours I was offered two alternatives: to downgrade myself to economy with the children with no compensation, or pay the airport upgrade price for them to travel with me in business, which I did because the staff at BCN believed Qatar would refund me as the mistake was theirs. On the return trip from HKG the check in staff had no problem with the children travelling in economy and me in business and the return trip was far easier. I was astounded by the mistakes and three months later, Qatar is still refusing me any refund or any form of compensation for the money I was forced, apparently needlessly, to spend on the outward journey so that the children could travel with me in business class. I am shocked at the inconsistency between its rules applied on check-in in Barcelona and Hong Kong outstations.",Detractor

" We were flying from Paris to Doha in business class in the new Q-suite. You are immediately overwhelmed by the luxury this new suite has to offer. We fly as a couple and when we were seated they lowered the blind in between the two seats so you immediately felt that you had your own private compartment. We were receiving a refreshment drink to our choice before take off. After take-off you can close the doors on your suite and then it really feels like you are in a private room on an airplane. The seats have many modification possibilities, even a real double bed feature. My wife fell in love with the blankets who were especially designed for this new q-suite, they feel so nice. The in-flight entertainment set provides a very big bright screen and the latest hollywood blockbusters available. The cabin crew was so nice to us, they really made this trip even more special by the way they treated us. I had pre-ordered an asian vegetarian meal but the flight attendant looked through the menu with me to see if i changed my menu to what i preferred most. It was no problem to switch the desert and main course since it looked more appetising to me. The food was really good. Even with ordering some snacks they explained everything what was on the menu and recommended the size of portions i ordered.

Main meal was good although the portions these days are extremely small. All drinks including water are served in small plastic cups. Plenty of drink runs were made throughout the flight. Only disappointment was the breakfast, some sort of snack wrap which was awful. Stockholm to Durban was delayed once we were all on board and ready to take-off. Not the airlines fault, there was a medical problem with one of the passengers so we parked and medics were called. It meant we missed our connection in Doha, As we came off the plane there was our name on a board, the ground crew had our new boarding passes and vouchers for a hotel, very officiant! Beautiful 5 star hotel (even for economy class passengers) far better than the one Emirates uses in Dubai. Very generous meal allowance of $180 per person, couldn't even spend it all.

In DOH I was told that even with a First ticket you could not take a guest with you, even though he was on a business ticket.

The cabin was spacious and the seat did make a comfortable bed, but no pjamas offered and no mattress cover, only a meager thin blanket con this daytime flight.

Took a trip to the bar to see it as had been told was worth a look, and it was but very busy, so retreated back to my seat.

"  Copenhagen to Male via Doha. The business class seat in the middle is very exposed on the 787, however the A350 was a much nicer cabin experience, even though the central overhead lockers are removed, the A350 seemed my more spacious and airy. Food was nothing exceptional, dine on demand is fine in business, however if your to sleep and the passenger opposite decides at 2am to eat, you'll be disturbed. The pyjamas were a lovely touch, but the rest of the bedding was really poor, think blankets and lumpy pillows. Service out of CPH was rushed and the crew seemed harangued, however on the MLE sector it was much improved, the cabin was half full. I think Qatar crews lack the finesse and professionalism of Singapore Airlines, quite disappointed for my first time with QR.",Passive
"  Qatar Airways is one of the best airlines I have ever flown with. The service onboard is fabulous. However on this flight to Paris - Bangkok - Doha and then Doha - Paris, I noticed a few things which should be improved. Check-in in Bangkok could be better and more classy. Business check-in was a bit too laid back. In Bangkok, Qatar uses Thai Airways Business lounge. It is a great lounge but some privileges are not accessible to Qatar business class passengers, massages for instance. Onboard, it was great however the selection of wines was better a few years ago. For instance, Pol Roger rosÃ© was a better Champagne than Lanson.",Promoter
  London Heathrow to Doha. Very good. Check in opened early. No queue. Very pleasant staff. Only 150 pax so three seats each. Superb service throughout. Aircraft was delayed due to air traffic at LHR. But arrived on time. Only disappointment was the food. Not up to the normal Qatar standards. But cabin crew were very attentive. Its the attitude of the crew that make a real difference. Overall a very pleasant experience.,Promoter
"  Bangkok to Atlanta via Doha. I had 6 meals on this trip, sampled the first, picked at the second and third and just looked at the rest to see if there were any positive changes. Only one time did the attendant came by to pick up used cups, napkins. Since I had a window seat, I did not feel like squeezing past the aisle seat and walking my garbage down to the galley. They were good about handing out water - just not about collecting it. A340 had the shortest legroom I have experienced, my seat back was short and uncomfortable and the bathroom nearest me ran out of water early into the flight. I needed Wi-Fi from DOH to ATL but they did not offer any.",Detractor
"  Manchester to Auckland via Doha legs seemed to be older planes, with seats in pairs rather than singles on an angle. Food was okay. I was looking forward to a cold beer but only 2 options of lager which is my last resort. The staff were all very attentive. Return flight Auckland to Doha had same pod set up which was again disappointing. The Doha to MAN leg actually had a newer plane, quieter and with individual pods - significantly better all round. I'm quite tech savvy but their in flight viewing control system remained a mystery to me, I managed to watch stuff but it wasn't particularly intuitive. On the last leg on the newer plane I had the problem of not being able to turn the headphone volume down enough, changing headphone set made no difference. Ended up having to have the headphone half open on my ears to reduce the volume. No one else seemed to have an issue.",Promoter

"  London to Tokyo via Doha. Checked in on line and choose seat a for both myself and my partner, bag drop at LHR T4 quick and polite security was very quick at 11am on a Thursday morning, was given access to the Skyteam lounge with my oneworld status? Qatar never offer there own lounge to FF but I guess it is advised in the rules. Anyway Skyteam lounge is pretty comfortable so fine. Boarded through gate A6 it was all very quick on to a newish clean A380 seats 31A & 31B on the upper deck.. Departed on time the flight wasn't full so a pretty nice atmosphere on board. Lunch served shortly after airborne was actually very nice lots of drinks offered during the flight with a hot sandwich tra coffee served about an hour before arrival. Had 3 hours in Doha which was a pleasant time visiting the shops onyx lounge and a walk around. Boarding the DOH-NRT flight from D22 via a bus however it wasn't too bad. The aircraft was spotless and strangely almost empty so while we had assigned seats we actually sat where we wanted with all but about 20 seats in the last cabin almost free. Departed on time again once airborne breakfast served quickly. I then slept across 4 seats for 6 hours once awake was offered coffee before I guess pre landing dinner which was okay but not as good as the previous flight. Landed on time after 9hrs 30min the whole trip was longer but much better than my usual BA. I have used QR about 20 times now in both business & economy. Economy upper deck on the A380 is difficult to beat. My first time on the 777-300ER with 3-4-3 seating and pleased it was pretty empty because I can imagine it would be pretty cramped when full.",Promoter
"  Flew Manchester to Seoul via Doha. As a 5-star airline I expected high things from Qatar Airways. Whilst my experience was perfectly adequate, I wasn't overwhelmed. The terminal they use at Manchester Airport couldn't be further from the train station, and Economy check-in was pretty average. Flight and food were fine. Staff quite attentive. Doha Airport looked fantastic but organisationally it was a bit haphazard.

On this trip I enjoyed the older 777 layout and entertainment system over the so called state of the art 787-8 which had hard seats that hurt my shoulder with very little privacy. The entertainment system on the outbound flight was ok but on the 787 was very difficult to operate. Food on both flights was less than average, the encrusted chicken tasted awful and even worse was my choice of appetizer on the return flight, the Arabic Mezze which I missed was dropped by the cabin attendant and it was the last one. I had to miss that and even the ice cream was out, I just did not know what I had paid for.",Passive
"  Baku to Muscat via Doha. My flight Baku to Doha at 3:30AM has been cancelled because of technical issues and I was late for my next flight from Doha to Muscat.

Their staff informed me about that just 3.5 hours before original flight departure and that they are can't book me on other airlines flight. Even after I spoke with Duty Officer and explained I need to be at work tomorrow, they didn't help. My original tickets were for Business Class from Baku and First Class from Doha, but when I came to Airport for a flight booked for me, staff issued me Economy Class ticket for my flight from Doha. When I asked why, they said the QA system now shows Economy Class. It took me some time to prove that my original cancelled flight was for First class. I decided to speak with the Manager in Baku airport and she advised me to write to Customer Care.

The entertainment system proved slow/inconvenient and is not comparable to Qatar's own aircraft. The service was very slow and partially disorganized. This resulted e.g. in no drinks being served together with the meal. They have cut down on the menu choices compared to previous flights. Both the starter as well as the main course were tasteless. All in all, this was a huge disappointment.",Detractor
"  Flew Chennai to New York JFK via Doha. Business class is really great especially on the Doha to New York Sector. Almost every few seats have a dedicated stewardess who pampers you all throughout the 12-13 hours. My biggest disappointment was they overbooked the flight from Doha to Chennai and upgraded several Economy passengers to Business. I have no worries with that and have been lucky myself several times. However, Qatar has to be sensitive to Business travellers who prefer to travel alongside other serious business travellers and not passengers who are noisy and get tipsy halfway through the flight. Will stop flying Business on Qatar if they don't profile passengers before upgrading them to higher class of travel.",Detractor
"  Johannesburg to Chicago via Doha. Qatar Airways went beyond expectations when dealing with my luggage enroute to South Africa from Toronto with a transfer in Philly. Upon my arrival in Doha, I was called to the gate desk so they could ensure my luggage went on the plane with me. I've never experienced this before with any other airline. On my return overnight flight back from JoBurg, I accidentally left a package in the overhead bin. The manager at the transfer desk personally arranged for that package to be brought immediately from the plane, which was parked far away from the actual terminal building, to me so I could take it on my connecting flight to Chicago. My connection was tight but they made it happen... AND changed my seat allocation so I could have 3 seat empty seats for my transatlantic flight. Every interaction I had during my long 28+hour journeys was exemplary service. Qatar wins my vote hand down.",Promoter

On October 22nd, the day before my flight, I went online to on Qatar's website to check my seat selection was still valid. I hadn't received any notifications by text, email or via the Qatar app on my phone, yet online, there was a warning box showing that my itinerary had been changed.

"  Check-in at Manchester was excellent, although I'd pre-selected my seat I was offered and accepted a change to a seat in the first row with additional legroom. Qatar use the Escape lounges at Manchester which now has a separate business lounge with hot meal options. The flight was 40 minutes late departing from Manchester and as I only had one hour transit in Doha I was concerned about getting my connection, the cabin crew were very supportive and kept checking the likely arrival time and explained if I missed my flight there was another Bangkok flight not long afterwards, they found out the gate number of my flight and made sure I was the first person off the aircraft. Flight was excellent, seats comfortable even for passengers of my height I've always considered the food on Qatar to be the best with lots of choice a decent choice of entertainment on the video channels. I did make my connection but it was a bit tight. Outgoing flights were on A330 / A340 while returning aircraft's were Boeing 777 / 787. In my opinion little to choose between them although the 787 has the best seating 1x2x1, all aircraft's had been changed since I first booked, not a huge problem apart from having to forever change your preferred seat on the Qatar website. Being able to pre-order your main meal in advance was new although it's only on flights from Doha at present. Outstanding flight crews on all four flights, friendly and attentive to your needs a credit to Qatar Airways. Due to short transit time didn't have time to visit the business class lounge at Hamad International Airport although I did manage a short time there on my flight home. Similar experience at Bangkok, early check-in for flights and fast track through passport control the new Qatar lounge isn't open yet so still using one or other of two Thai Airways lounge noticed they've removed the TV screen since me previous visit which only ever had CNN. Still the world's best airline by far with the finest staff on the ground and in the air.",Promoter

There was no entertainment system on board but you had 15 min of free WiFi. They served very tasty food and drinks. The seat wasn't so comfortable because you didnt have much space. The transfer at Hamad Airport was fast. The flight to Frankfurt was operated with a A350-900 from LATAM Airlines. The Services was great but the snack and the breakfast was only okay. There was no WiFi and the entertainment system is not as good as on Qatar Airways own aircrafts. The seats were good and you had enough legroom including a footrest.

  I booked Qatar Airways to Male and had a boat transfer from Male to an island. But the flight got delayed by 3 hours due to late aircraft arrival and I missed my boat transfer. Qatar Airways ground agents told me to book a hotel in Male and take the next day transfer and get reimbursed the fees. I had to stay an extra night in Male due to this delay it made sense to me that Qatar Airways will pay the additional cost. So I submitted the hotel receipt to Qatar Airways but the customer service agent replied that they will not reimburse the additional cost incurred due to this delay. This is unacceptable as I followed what their agent told me to do.,Detractor

"  Sofia to Hong Kong via Doha. I had the worst experience with staff at Doha Airport. I chose a flight with a longer transit in between, so I could see Doha with a complimentary tour of Doha. I landed just in time to make it to their evening tour, which is the last tour of the day. I had about 45 min before the tour starts, so as soon as I landed, I quickly made my way to the immigration, and headed out. When I was out, I was looking for the location of the desk, where it says it's at concourse B. I managed to find WH Smith, but there was no desk close by. I went to the information desk and asked where to find this tour, the lady told me it's before immigration. I know I was running out of time, it wouldn't make sense for me to go back to the other side and come back out again. Therefore I asked the lady if she could call the tour desk for me, to let them know I was waiting outside. The lady was not helpful at all, she was unwilling to call for me. I asked her what option do I have if I want to join the tour, she said I have to go back in to join the tour. So I followed her advice and went back in. Before I went back in, I spoke to 2 other staff, I told them the reason I was out, and the reason I had to go back inside, they just said â€˜ok' and pointed towards the security and immigration to me. I wanted to make sure I can actually go back inside and come back out again afterwards. Since 2 people I've asked said ok, I thought it would be ok. By the time I got back in, I finally found his desk for the tour. There was a closed sign at the desk, but I went to speak to the lady there, she told me I was too late, they cannot add me to the tour group any more. She told me to come back the next day. My connecting flight was early morning, I would be gone by then! I saw an information desk about Doha, so I went over, and asked for some information if I wanted to go out myself (the only helpful and friendly guy I've spoken to during my time at the Doha Airport!) I've got all the information I need, including a map, so I was ready to go through immigration to head out again on my own this time. However, immigration did not let me through, they said I already used my one time visa, so I can't go out again.",Detractor

Qatar Airways London lounge is first rate, seriously good food, table clothes, table service, friendly professional staff and they even have magazines you want to read. When you get on the flight to Doha, the cabin is awesome - Q class, means you essentially have small area to yourself. Food on the plane on a par with Emirates, and the whole flight and approach of the staff really good. I am shortly flying business on BA to Toronto, I will report back on it, but am not optimistic.

"  Manchester to Doha and return. Originally booked this flight for the Boeing 787 operating it but about 4 weeks before departure noticed that it was now an A330, no problem as I like the A330. Check in at Manchester was very good, the ladies on Business class were fast and very funny and it was an enjoyable experience. The business class lounge was a disappointment. The plane had the new style seats fitted - in my opinion these are not as good as the old seats. Sitting in the window seat with the passenger in the aisle seat fully reclined, it needs mountaineering skills to get to the aisle. Also, the window seat has very restricted room for your feet when fully reclined. The IFE was OK but I struggled to find anything that I really wanted to watch. By far the worst aspect (and this applies to Emirates A380 too) was the almost total lack of room for your elbows, you are very restricted. The cabin service on the outbound flight was superb, the food was good and the provision of non alcoholic Champagne is very welcome to any teetotallers travelling. On the return journey the check in was superb and very efficient. The business class lounge was crowded and there was a queue for the toilets but they were kept clean. The plane was again fitted with the new seating arrangements and again I prefer the old style but the general cabin appearance gives a feeling of space. Cabin service again was very good and you got the feeling that nothing was too much trouble. Food was OK and was well presented. On both flights, the toilets were kept very clean and stocked with toothbrushes and toiletries. All in all a totally different experience from the last time I travelled with Qatar, the cabin crew were exceptionally good.",Promoter

Managed to sleep for part of the journey and enjoyed the flight. The return journey was also very good with excellent service from the cabin services director. Due to feeling unwell I did not take any food but was kept well supplied with water by the cabin crew. On both flights the toilets were kept very clean and well stocked. Both flights departed on time, although when leaving Bali we were delayed at the runway access for 20 minutes waiting for an incoming flight.

However, they try to sell the business seats or upgrade for cash until last day. Eventually, at check-in, I upgraded to business class for miles (â€œQ-creditsâ€). This was easy, and I had only to wait 5 Minutes until the flight manager could confirm that the appropriate food could be availed within this short notice of only 2Â½ hours. It worked out and I signed a form to deduct Q-credits from my FFP programme. In Copenhagen QR uses Aspire, a third party lounge, one of the poorest lounges â€“ no hot food, poor drinks etc. Boarding was easy and quick. At seat, pre-departure soft drinks were drink provided. No pre-departure champagne offered â€“ only for CPH and CDG in Europe champagne is not served pre-departure? Food was so, so and tasteless.

There were several meal options per flight (move snacks, main meal, ice cream snack etc). The toilets and cabin were kept clean and lots of trays of water were served. The leg room was very problematic for me. On the leg from Auckland to Doha the air conditioning was not functioning properly for several hours making it uncomfortably warm during a very long bout of turbulence. From Athens to Doha the meal service was excruciatingly slow and the main meal was inedible. Our row were given the last of three meal choices (Chicken) as they had run out of everything else. The two people next to me complained and they somehow found a pasta and beef meal for them. All of us could not eat more than one fork full of our meals as they were completely dry and overcooked, and tasteless. The media service on the shorter legs was non existent. On the Doha to Auckland routes was okay as long as you don't mind having to see the same adverts in front of every media offering - aimed at residents of Doha. Movies were oddly curated. The staff are lovely but is economy class a 5 star experience, no.",Passive
"  Another wonderful experience with Qatar Airways, upgraded to First Class from Melbourne to Doha on the A380. Very attentive flight attendants, with delicious food and wine served. The bathroom is a whole other level of luxury with plenty of space and hidden drawers for the amenities. The cabin itself is small and very private, and extremely comfortable. Business class Doha to Helsinki on the smaller A321, once again very attentive service by the flight attendants on this sector and Athens to Doha and Doha to Melbourne. Seats ok on the A321, could be improved. Flew business class on the A330 from Athens which was comfortable, and the marvellous A380 Doha to Melbourne. Loved the Business class service on this flight, it was faultless, the flight attendant looking after our section was superb and was very attentive. Will definitely fly Qatar Airways again.",Promoter
"  Flew Doha to Kolkata. A superb inflight experience. Smooth night flight that was on schedule. Inflight staff exceedingly attentive. Excellent selection of movies from all over the world. Food and wine offerings were varied and ample. A full course dinner was served at a time of my choosing. The seat layout, 1-2-1, provided not only space but privacy too. The seat had several configuration angles and were easy to use to get into a comfortable sitting position or sleep which I was able to for a couple of hours. A nice amenities bag was provided. A small disappointment was that none of the four items I selected from the in-flight duty free catalog was available. I would also have liked the Indian government landing card provided on board as it would avoid some hassle before the immigration counter on arrival. On this route, I would unhesitatingly fly Qatar Airways again. From aircraft ambience and sitting arrangements to quality of inflight service to punctuality and smoothness of flight, they have set the standard to emulate.",Promoter
"  Lagos to Washington via Doha. We had boarded yesterday 24th September 2017 in Lagos and was about to take off at about 11am when the pilot announced that there was a technical fault in one of the engines. We were disembarked from the plane and waited without any word from the airline until around 5pm when we were taken to the hotel. We are still in the hotel, no word from the airline and this is the following day. It most unfortunate and irresponsible. No word of apology, no update, no effort been made.",Detractor
"  Doha to Perth. After just arriving from London, the plane was late which meant a very quick turnover for the start of what I thought would be a gruelling 11hr flight to Perth only to be made more so pleasant by the kindness and professional services of a cabin staff. The plane was full and people were understandably restless, including myself. Staff remained calm, professional and helpful throughout the long duration of the flight which put my mind at ease knowing i was in good hands.",Promoter
  Kuala Lumpur to London via Doha. Three of us were travelling under two bookings and the online facility was not allowing me to sit with two of my family. Luckily at check-in this was rectified so we were provided with 2 blocks of 3 seats for both legs. The flight was amended out of KUL so we missed the A350 and were changed to QR15 which was 2 hours later into LHR. Both planes left on time. Toilets were clean although water was not draining from the sink hole. Food was good - I had potatoes gratin with random white fish served with the usual roll and some trimmings. The sandwich on serving 2 is not a sandwich but a dough slice. Wine volume has been reduced ( I fly Qatar 2/3 times per year ) and I was given 85 ml on my first serving and 100ml on my second serving. Qatar normally provides 187mm bottles and on a 7 hour leg you always get 3 if you ask. IFE screen was only partially responsive,Passive
"  Bangkok to Bucharest via Doha. I was excited to be flying on an A380 for the first time and to be flying Qatar Airways. The counter at BKK told me that the only bag I had, a carry-on that weighed just 10kg, should be checked in. I was very disappointed. All throughout the flight I was worried that if my luggage didn't come with me what I would wear. The flight was very smooth. The cabin service was great. Food was excellent. Flight was on time. On the down side, the wifi hardly worked. The seats were uncomfortable. I say small because with the hype of travelling in luxury on 380 I expected more. Or maybe my expectation was too high.",Passive
"  Johannesburg to Montreal via Doha with Qatar Airways. Arrived at the check-in counter only to find it not open despite it being 3 hours before the departure time. Following check-in which offered no hint of a problem, I proceeded to the lounge first and then the gate close to the scheduled departure time. At 30 minutes to departure there was no aircraft and no sign of ground agents which was the first sign of a pending problem. After the agents showed up and at around the scheduled departure time, the electronic boards showed a gate change but the gate agents could not confirm it. Eventually, all passengers made their way to the new gate where we were told the plane had a technical issue but it was almost resolved meaning we would board shortly. As minutes ticked away, this story changed multiple times and finally at midnight the station manager showed up to tell all of us that the flight was cancelled. What unfolded after can only be described as pandemonium with 200+ passengers many of which had already missed their connecting flights from Doha demanding answers from the ground agents who seemed to be unable to provide straight answers. All passengers were bussed to nearby hotels and many of us are getting to our destination 24 hours later than planned. Everyone who travels by air knows that hiccups happen from time to time but what differentiates the good service providers from the rest is how they handle these situations.",Detractor
  Philadelphia to Hyderabad via Doha. I am a 70+ old lady with walking disability and was travelling alone from USA to India. Qatar Airways service was excellent and stayed at the airport during my break of journey. The service was excellent and a model for other airport hotels and airlines.

"  Manchester to Singapore via Doha. A fantastic introduction to business class. I've always travelled to Singapore with Singapore Airlines, economy usually, but the jump to business was steep, almost Â£1,000 more than Qatar at the time I booked - now I'm hooked on Qatar's hospitality. The seat was so comfortable, whichever setting I had it on, I wanted the flight to continue even after landing. The food was delicious, and presented beautifully. Drinks and refreshments were constantly offered. Entertainment via a 17"" screen was a joy to watch, especially with the noise reducing headphones I'd highly recommend Qatar, especially their business class product.",Promoter
"  Dallas Fort Worth to Kuala Lumpur via Doha. Such a pleasant flight with Qatar Airways. I have sat in multiple business class flights but this was one of my most pleasant long-haul flights. I believe my satisfaction has to do with the superior flight attendants for both the flights. Not only were they attentive, they were fast in their service and always with a smile. What's more, they were even considerate enough to ask when we would like our meals to be served. I would like to particularly thank one cabin staff who served me on flight from Doha to Kuala Lumpur with her gentle voice and pleasant smile. She made me feel right at home upon stepping into the aircraft with her exceptional service. I would also like to note that the take-off and landing both times were flawless. Thumbs up to the captain. The Godiva chocolate is a nice touch. Without a doubt, I would choose to fly with Qatar again. Can't wait to experience their QSuites. Things that they may improve: - Food: vegetables looked and tasted over cooked. I also had the chicken gnocchi, they were mushy and soft.",Promoter
"  Edinburgh to Muscat via Doha. I used to fly British Airways 3 or 4 times a year between Muscat and Edinburgh but considering the visible decline in both aircraft quality and service now being offered by BA I decided to try Qatar Airways. The difference is night & day! From booking to boarding there is nothing that is too much trouble for Qatar Airways staff. Onboard you will find spotless aircraft, in my case the fabulous A350 between Muscat and Doha and the equally pleasant 787-8 Doha to Edinburgh. You will also experience a crew that are not only efficient but also value you as a passenger. Although I was travelling in Business class both the Muscat - Doha and Doha - Muscat sectors are ticketed in First which allowed me access to the First Class lounge at Doha airport. This far exceeds the lounges offered by BA in both Edinburgh and T5 Heathrow. Both aircraft provided comfortable seating and decent IFE in the ""Oryx One"" system. Food and beverage service is excellent with Qatar offering an ""eat on request"" service which eliminates the requirement of a food cart. Meals are served individually on white linen with proper cutlery and tableware. There was an excellent choice of refreshments to accompany meals and additional snacks and refreshments can be requested throughout the flight. I recognize that Qatar Airways are not the cheapest option but in a ""value for money"" comparison with other available carriers I feel they are a very good choice. I will be booking this years Christmas escape with Qatar Airways. Truly a 5 star airline.",Promoter
"  Tokyo to London via Doha. Not impressed, a new aircraft with a cramped cabin. I found the seats not very comfortable and the cabin service was not great.

"  Bangkok to Milan via Doha, returning from Rome. Check in was a breeze, and I waited only 5 minutes. I was greeted by the cabin senior, who was polite and welcoming. This flight was about 85% full. I was seated where the second cabin senior with 12 years' experience was in charge of, he was polite and observant. He noticed my mother sitting in the middle seat squeezed in and very uncomfortable, and he said he will move her to a more comfortable spot once the service ends. Food on board this flight was sub par. The 777's seats are tight, and overhead bins get filled up very quickly. Transfer in Doha was really tight, with no time to spare. The next flight to Milan was an A330. I prefer 2-4-2 configuration more than 3-3-3 or 3-4-3 configuration, as couples can sit together. On this flight, the crew were much more experienced, friendly and professional. On the return flight, check in at Rome was worse than Bangkok. Boeing 787 roomy atmosphere on board all added to a great flight. The seats are very comfortable and felt like an armchair in full recline. The crew on this flight were fantastic. After breakfast service, I went to talk to the cabin senior in the galley, and he had some spare business class meals, and he obliged me to try them, and he also gave me some snacks, which was everything an avgeek could ask for. Before landing, he asked me if wanted to try the business class seats. On the flight to Bangkok, it was another 777, and the crew were still excellent. Excluding disorganised ground staff, Qatar is an excellent choice.",Promoter

The distance between seats is very good even for a 185cm tall person like me could stretch out with room to spare. With around 500 passengers on board the A380 boarding and disembarking was quick. Refreshments were served periodically between meals which were all good as well. Highly recomend Qatar Airways.",Promoter
  Denpasar to Berlin via Doha in July 2017. This time I was lucky to get both legs on the A330-300 so I could avoid the Boeing 777-300 and cramped B787. The A330-300 operates with the rather spacious 2-4-2 seat configuration whereas the B773 is 3-4-3 and the B787 is 3-3-3. As a result you get a much better passenger staff ratio and better service in the A330 compared to the Boeing aircraft. Moreover you get more personal space (33 inch seat pitch and 17.5 inch seat width). On the Boeing 777-300 with 3-4-3 configuration you have to queue at the lavatories struggling to get through the narrow aisles. My suggestion would be to choose the aircraft wisely if you have the option to do that.,Passive

At the time of booking we contacted Qatar Airways customer service to ask if we could avail of their complimentary hotel stay in the airport for our long layover. We were told that we could avail of this service on the day we arrive in Doha by a customer service representative on the phone. On arrival in Doha today we were told that our fare was promotional and we are not eligible for the hotel, meaning we are stuck in the airport for the next 16hrs. The staff were unapologetic and offered us no alternatives other than paying for hotels with our own money. The flight was disappointing WITH mediocre food and hard seats.

"  I was scheduled to fly yesterday from Atlanta to Chennai via Doha. After all check-in, security clearance process, I was informed that the flight is cancelled while boarding. They didn't send any notifications to mobile or email. They said we need to rebook for next available flight and asked us to check out all luggages. I checked out and was waited at the booking counter line for 2 hours. For the entire Atlanta International airport, they had only one booking counter open and one booking agent available. After one hour of waiting, I got frustrated and called their customer service while staying on the line. I was on call-wait status for 50 minutes before getting hold of someone in their customer service. Customer service agent couldn't rebook me on next day flight unless I'm ready to do a 3 stopper instead of 1 stopper that I booked. I got the same itinerary 2 days later and asked him to book it. He couldn't book me because I was already checked-in and they needed me checked out from airport side. He said he will do all that and call + email me later with confirmation. I never received any call or email till today. I called their customer service again and was able to get hold of someone after 30 minutes wait. I got the same answer today as well. They have asked me to call them again after 4 hours. Not sure how long I should be on hold to get hold of them. And their website still shows the flight status as delayed and not as cancelled.

"  Stockholm to Bangkok via Doha. Check-in operated by SAS staff at Stockholm opens 3hrs before, a little slow as they validate visas and pass people along to pay extra baggage where applicable, but nothing worryingly so - all outsourced check-in is the same in my experience. Boarding Boeing 787 was efficient. Aircraft hot until about 15 minutes after departure. Legroom and space felt very limited, especially with the IFE box under the non-middle seats, but it wasn't the nightmare I had geared myself up to expect. It took a while for water to be distributed, a small bottle of water on each seat would go far to passive passenger until the first service. Water only available in tiny glasses, no larger containers or bottles available. Transfer at Doha efficient, the benefits of bus service is they open both front and rear doors, so the five minutes you spend on the airport tour is mitigated by the ten minutes saved by non-bridge disembarking. Flight to Bangkok on Boeing 777 full, gate security slow, seats a little better than 787 due to no IFE box. Plane hot, several minute pushback delay and no water again for the first hour. Meals were good, staff were great - very friendly, toilets were always clean. However I've cancelled my return flights in April 2018 taking the $200 on tax refund and putting it towards another airline. Qatar need to address the seating on the 787 or at least remove the under seat IFE boxes.",Passive

The seats were really comfortable, and provided nice privacy and comfortable sleep experience compared to others flown recently. Onboard meals were nice, beautifully presented and very good quality, with again some really nice wines. Inflight entertainment had a very wide choice of movies and tv programmes, and it was just the repetitive adverts that annoyed.

The flight was full and a red eye flight. Cabin Crew were very accommodating and friendly. The cabin crew won't disturb passengers who are sleeping. Food was served twice in the flight, one around 30 mins after take off and one 2 hours before landing. Food taste is ok, not that great but ok for airline food. For the Doha to Paris flight, the plane used was the A380 which is my favorite plane due to the comfort it gives to the passenger aside from being very quiet. This is where one flight attendant was a bit of a let down because she wasn't that accommodating and she speaks like she is a bit grumpy.

On the first flight the A332 (A7-ACF/12 years old) was refurbished and it seemed quite new, Ife (Oryx ONE) on this flight was displayed on large HD touch screens. On the other flights the aircraft wasn't refurbished so the IFE was old and controllable only with the remote control (there was also a big ife box under windows seats obstructing more than a quarter of foot room) - the seats weren't as comfortable as the ones on the first aircraft.

Being Ramadan (although a night flight and we were traveling when Ramadan restrictions are lifted), that may have been a problem too, but a colleague at work had the same problem a month or two before when flying to Australia and it was not Ramadan, and refused to fly himself or his family on Qatar again because of that. However, one of the hostesses was extremely good and saved the day by going up front and bringing me back a large paper coffee cup with a decent quantity of beer in it - which I appreciated because I did not want to be insensitive to those around me since in economy anyway and it was Ramadan so fine to have it in a paper cup for all involved - including me, as Qatar ought to be sensitive to my wants too as I am also a paying customer. Although the cabin was modern and clean and the staff brilliant I felt sorry for anyone who would have to fly in such cramped seats internationally. Qatar now have 10 across on the 777, instead of 9. Things improved dramatically when I got to Doha and travelled onto New York. The new A350 is an absolutely beautiful plane to fly on. For business class, much better than the A380, despite no bar. It is more intimate, service is much better (the hosts on the A380 being overstretched with so many to serve) and the plane is so silent and smooth with good air quality you really notice. Brilliant hard product on this plane, brilliant service, quite good food (although Qatar has gone a little down-hill the last 2/3 years on that front - I remember the Beluga Caviar starters I used to get back then), great in flight entertainment, and a good nights sleep after my bed was made up. Their business product puts most others to shame, although I hope they aim back at trying to make it a business class product as good as first again. Flight home from New York was pretty much a mirror image, although the food was really not up to par with what I am used to on Qatar.",Promoter
  Mumbai to Boston via Doha. Flying with Qatar Airways was the best experience ever. The cabin crew were remarkable and all the entertainment is excellent. I give a 10 on 10 for the best service I got and I will prefer Qatar Airways for international travels. Thank you for your wonderful service.,Promoter
"  Bangkok to Warsaw via Doha. Qatar Airways keeps standard at the highest level. The seat arrangement is most comfortable among all business classes (1+2+1 for the aircraft I flew) and service reminds of a high class restaurant due to small but important details. Serving drinks in dedicated glassware instead of one uniform glass, food served on china plates instead of plastic trays, engaged and helpful staff, high quality cosmetics (maybe except of Armani sets handed out previously). The bar in A380 helps to relax and and socialize with fellow passengers. Cons: only a few business lounges so outside of Qatar it's difficult to have true Qatar Airways experience before taking off. Taking alcohol off view during Ramadan shouldn't be the case in the international air territory in a plane full of all the races.",Promoter
"  Madrid to Singapore via Doha in economy class. Crews professional but robotic. Seats, on-board entertainment and meals are all fine. Wifi expensive and limited. Leased A350 from LATAM on MAD-DOH sector was a step down from Qatar Airways own A350 product and first time that I've been so hot on a flight. Ticket prices and schedules are often competitive, at least for the two ultra-last-minute trips I've purchased this summer. You get what you pay for perhaps, which is just fine, but I don't understand the 5-star hype.",Passive
  Los Angeles to Bangkok via Doha. This is the first time my husband and I fly with Qatar Airways and we love it - and won't be the last time. My husband is from England and I'm from Thailand. We fly very often out of the country. It was our honeymoon and the flight attendants starting with the ground lady in LA at the counter when we checked in and the crew members treated us so special. They have done a wonderful job. A big thank to all the crew members for making us feel so special with the cake & heart decoration before we landed and during the flight we got pampered. We would fly with Qatar again. Business class is surely such a treat! Keep up the excellent work! We will post the pictures on our social media. Thanks for the memorable experience Qatar Airways.,Promoter
"  I flew on Qatar Airways from Auckland to Heathrow return (via Doha), firstly on the Boeing 787 to Doha then on the A380 to Heathrow. This is the best airline I have flown, and I have travelled the world on many occasions. I was a bit sceptical on the Auckland to Doha journey (this being the longest flight in the world) but I need not have worried, as the time passed quickly thanks to the excellent cabin crew, regularity of good quality meals and beverages and the generous amount of leg room. I was lucky enough to be seated upstairs in Economy on the A380 to Heathrow. My return journey was just as good and I was again lucky enough to have 3 seats to myself on both the Heathrow to Doha flight and Doha to Auckland. Overall Qatar would be the top my list of airlines to fly again with and is definitely value for money.",Promoter
"  First time on Qatar Airways from London to Bali via Doha and won't be the last - they are streets ahead with their business product over Emirates and Etihad. The lounge in LHR was top notch with an amazing a la carte service. Onboard the staff were super friendly and attentive with a high class of food. The bar at the back of the plane is great and service again exemplary. The seat was really comfortable - no complaints. On the second leg to DPS on the A330 I was expecting to be disappointed having just been on the A380. I was wrong, the service was even better. Massive smiles, nothing too much trouble, even profuse apologies for the selected red wine being too cold - now that's service. The whole outbound service blew me away. The one niggle is that the Oryx entertainment system lacks in the latest releases - now I feel I am being picky.",Promoter
"  Melbourne to Athens via Doha. The cabin crew created a restful and friendly atmosphere. A number of children who were restless and tired while boarding quickly settled down when they received their activity packs. I found that the time of the first long leg passed quickly thanks to ambient lighting, attentive service and an entertainment system which worked without any problems. From Doha to Athens the flight attendant allocated to our seat was particularly helpful, responding courteously to special requests about meals and drinks. On both legs the plane was full but remained clean and orderly throughout. Passengers seemed aware of the need to make some variations to the flight path. As I had a window seat I got to see a most impressive snow capped mountain peak below. The minimal amount of time added was amply compensated for by the efficient way the flight crew managed boarding, disembarkation, take off and landing.",Promoter
"  Bangkok to Frankfurt via Doha. Bangkok ground staff are polite, but during boarding, it was the most chaotic scene. The Boeing 777-300 uses the 3-4-3 configuration. On this flight, the flight attendant serving my section was sub par of what I'm used to at Qatar airways. The food was fantastic. The flight to Frankfurt was on a brand new A350, with wide seats a the tail camera. I really like the exterior cameras! The flight attendant who was friends with another flight attendant I met before, and was polite and very friendly. On the return leg from Vienna, 4 counters open with few passengers. This time, the cabin was only 40% full, so I moved rows and had a whole row to myself. The catering from European airports is always good, so my braised beef with potato au gratin was excellent. The flight attendant I met remembered what I wanted and made the service so personalised it was like a first class flight in economy! She is the best flight attendant I've ever met! In the rear galley, I also met a Bhutanese and Moroccan flight attendant who were equally as nice. But the nicest of them all has to be the Cabin Services Director who came to my seat just before landing to say hello, and we exchanged pleasantries. During disembarkation, I asked if I was able to get a photo with the captain. While waiting for the captain to come out of the cockpit, I was able to try out the business class seat and found it superior to Cathay Pacific's product. On the return leg, wifi wasn't working for much of the flight. Overall, it was totally a 10/10 flight, with the minor complaints about the experience at Bangkok airport.",Promoter
"  Another excellent flight with Qatar Airways in Business Class. I flew Birmingham to Bangkok via Doha on the 787 Dreamliner first leg then A380 second leg. The 787 business cabin in excellent with plenty of space. The seats are 1-2-1 lie flat pod style all with aisle access. The service is always excellent, the staff are so well trained and always friendly, unlike Emirates. I had an amazing 4 course meal on the first leg, soup, fish, cheese cake and cheese board with 30 year tawny port. I watched 3 new movies on the 7 hour flight before arrival in Doha. I slept the entire second leg on the A380 as it was an overnight flight. The seats are the same but this aircraft has the inflight bar. I've had many good times in this bar but I didn't use it this time. I agree with other reviewers that Qatar offers the best business class, mainly due to the excellent staff. Emirates should send a mystery shopper to see how it should be done.",Promoter
"  Another excellent flight with Qatar Airways in Business class. I flew Phuket to Birmingham via Doha on Boeing 777 first leg then Boeing 787 second leg. The first leg had an aircraft change from Boeing 787 to Boeing 777 which was good as the Boeing 777 business cabin in so spacious. You get a metre of leg room, enough room to stand up. The seats are 2-2-2 so we took 2 near the window. They're very big and comfortable and lie-flat. The service was excellent as usual, I had a lovely 4 course meal, soup, sea bass, chocolate cake & cheese board with 30 year tawny port. The movie choice is not so good, I couldn't find anything new to watch as I'd watched the 3 best movies on the outbound flight from BHX. We had 3 hours between flights in Doha, the lounge was virtually empty and they're weren't serving alcohol due to Ramadan to the dismay of several western travelers. I slept the entire second leg on the 787 but I've already reviewed that in a previous post. Congratulations Qatar, keep up the good work.",Promoter
"  Doha to Cape Town. This is my tenth year flying with Qatar Airways, mostly to and from South Africa and the Middle East. This particular trip was truly remarkable. Everything was overwhelming, but the crew and especially the purser on this flight deserve special mention, what an extraordinary level of anticipation of every possible wish. On boarding I mentioned that I would prefer a window seat, the purser went and asked every single passenger seated by a window if they would swap with me. The food was outstanding too, the seat on the B787 comfortable enough to sleep for almost the entire flight. Qatar Airways is unique, in a class of its own.",Promoter
  Flew Qatar Airways from Bangkok to Copenhagen via Doha. Standards even higher than before. Did in total 6 premium flights and 2 economy. All flights top notch service and excellent crew.

"  Copenhagen to Ho Chi Minh City via Doha on 15-16 June 2017 on B787 and A330 respectively. Flights were on time and service was good. Doha airport deserted due to the ongoing blockage and due to Ramadan. QR tackles the crises well by preponing some of the connecting flights from Doha to avoid delays due to excessive lengths of routings avoiding unfriendly airspace. Check-in and crew onboard are diligent and almost faultless. Food, despite 3 choices offered, was not so good and continues to be of poorer and poorer quality and amounts. Completely inedible plastic sandwiches provided ""in lieu"" of proper meal to escape a second hot meal service. Poor wines. Alcoholic drinks were available but not disclosed due to Ramadan. We travelled two persons and were given 3-4 adjacent seats on both flights thus amble space. Elite fliers well respected and cared for. Lounge access working but the denial of access to Al Mourjan lounge in Doha hits hard: their elite flier lounges are not up to the game. Onboard, lengthy safety video shown with Barcelona FC become boring after being unchanged for several years. I am puzzled by the intrusive charity propaganda and money collection attempt by introducing ""Educate a Child"" propaganda without providing any facts and prove of efficiency. Children well cared for and given gifts and child meal given if requested prior to travel. Luggage handled well and all 4 pieces arrived to perfection at final destination.",Promoter
"  Doha to Amsterdam. This aircraft is the one with the 24 seat business class cabin in a 2X2X2 seat format across. Older aircraft and seat width is not as wide as on the new A380 and A350 at around 20.5 inches for upper part and smaller at the lower section. Fully flat seat but the lower half of the seat has been forced down further from people sitting or putting weight on what is not a very sturdy part of the seat so the seat needed to be raised a little to get it into a comfortable flat bed. However, service was excellent, four crew for 24 passengers with eat when you want from the menu. Breakfast on offer out of Doha and light snacks and meals available then or later with wine etc. before arriving in Amsterdam. Tasty food, nicely presented.",Promoter
"  May 12, flew ORD-DOH-DEL on QR 726/QR578 in Business Class. Qatar has never been anything but amazing and this trip was the best so far. Check-in agents were really fun and nice and checked the bag to Delhi. The only let-down of the entire trip was the lounge Qatar uses at O'Hare. The Air France/KLM lounge is shared by about 13 airlines so it is packed! This lounge should not allow more than a couple airlines to use it - nice food spread but too crowded and bad wifi. Wish Qatar shared the BA lounge here. Anyways we boarded on-time and the service started immediately. The friendly attendant came and introduced herself to my friend and me, handed out pyjamas and talked about the amenity kit that was already at our seats along with slippers and the blanket/duvet for sleeping. The purser then came to introduce herself and drinks were delivered after with a smile. Menus handed out and as Qatar does dine-on-demand you can eat anytime. It's much easier for the attendants as they don't have to serve everyone at once, but I can see how it can be arduous at times. Pushed back a bit late and a greeting from the flight deck for the 13.30 hour flight to Doha. Chose to eat dinner and watch movies - their AVOD is very good but not as good as Emirates. But their service kicks Emirates a million times over. So after dinner made up my bed and slept 6 hours but the flight was quite turbulent. Woke and washed up in the bathroom and my meal was ready for me - timed well from the excellent attendant. The only thing they could enhance is offering wifi on their 777-300 planes. That is where they are not as competitive as Emirates or Etihad. Landed 20 min late into Doha and a smooth transfer into the Al-Mourjan Business class lounge for some food and a nice shower. 2 hour connection was timed perfect and boarded our 787 for the 3 1/2 hour flight to Delhi. The 787 is much newer but my friend and I both preferred the 777-300ER biz seats. But still a great service and watched some Breaking Bad until a 2am ontime arrive into Delhi. Immigration was busy but got the bags and out to the taxi in 45 minutes. Qatar pushes things to a new level- even when flying them in coach it's pleasant. But their Business Class is the best of any airline in my opinion.",Promoter

"  Atlanta to Lagos via Doha. My 75 year old mother flew with Qatar and I was pleasantly surprised. Her lay over in Doha was overnight for about 12 hours or more and the last time they said the only hotel available inside the airport was full. This time we got the transit visa which was applied for on the website and was quickly processed and arrived before the 7 day published on the site. On arrival in Doha, Qatar Airways arranged for her transportation and escorted her to a nearby 4 star hotel, provided wifi, a dinner voucher, woke her up the next morning in time to get dressed, have breakfast and picked her up promptly for her onward journey. Hotel stay, food, and transportation for that night may have amounted to just about $125 which is a tiny fraction of her ticket cost but I am so impressed and grateful for the peace of mind l had that she was well taken care of. I will advocate for this airline any day.",Promoter
"  Sydney to Doha. Business class was full but crew were very efficient, excellent service. Seats were comfortable and large touch screen tv for entertainment system. Food service was a late dinner out of Sydney and early breakfast into Doha. Qatar also allow you to stagger your dining, setting times for when you would like dishes served which means they will reserve one of these dishes for you. Food presentation and range of dishes are more premium economy but they are very tasty. Fully flat bed is comfortable, not as wide as on Singapore but they are comfortable in flat bed.",Promoter
"  Belgrade to Doha. Belgrade's airport is small and you cannot get lost. Checking in was fast, but my passport needed several scans. First boarder control then security separate at each gate. Business lounge a kind of basic, but ok. First time on a Qatar Airways narrow body aircraft. 12 seats in a 2-2 configuration, seat the same as on the airline's A330-300. Very comfortable and fully flat, really big touch screens. Only the room for the feet on the 2C/D and 3C/D a little restricted for taller men. Amenity kit without cosmetics, but sufficient for a 4 hours 40 minutes flight time. Food and drink menu superbe as always. Not much difference in comfort in comparison to a wide body aircraft.",Promoter

"  Dubai to Chongqing via Dubai. Flight for partner and self booked using Guest Miles. Through a quirk of the pricing, Dubai World Central Airport more suitable. Unlike Dubai's main airport, no queues at check-in, immigration or security. Limited but adequate eating - McDonalds and Costa Coffee - and shopping. Flight left Dubai 15 minutes early, unusually in my experience berthing at an airbridge on arrival Doha thus no requirement to join the hordes fighting through security. One of Qatar's ageing Airbus 330s for the flight to Chongqing so no Wifi or power at seat, but perfectly clean and seat comfortable enough for a few hours sleep.

"  Istanbul to Cape Town via Doha. First leg was full on an A330 from Istanbul to Doha. First thing that was obvious was that this was an old plane. The seats looked like they had seen better days and the in flight screens were not touched and had to be controlled by hand held devices in the arm rest. On top of this, many screens were not working and people requested to have a reset. The crew were polite and the cabin senior from Bangladesh was the most outstanding crew member I have had in a while. He was older, wiser and had a knack for making me feel at home given the old plane and a poor inflight entertainment options. The meals were ok but the plastic containers look cheap and tacky and serving tea in paper cups seems like the cheap way out. The flight was on time and we arrived at gate before scheduled arrival. The onward leg to Cape Town was in the Boeing 787. I get the impression that at Hamad all flights from Doha to the developing world have to be subjected to the c20-27 gates which means being bused to a remote standing aircraft. I have experienced this before at Hamad. For elderly passengers this remote stand departures are a severe inconvenience. Boeing 787 seemed new, the inflight entertainment worked a charm and the cabin crew on this flight were wonderful. The meals were again just ok but I slept and thus just picked on the food. These were sale flights I booked and I don't know whether I would fly them again.",Passive

It was the third time, that I was overwhelmed by the quality of their product and the improvements. Qatar now has a branded Lounge in Dubai T1, calm, spotless and much more pleasant. On bord, it's not only the sophisticated seat (787), the low number of seats per toilet, the meal on demand-service or food and drinks (they serve Guinness!) that are special. My favourite part are the crews, who really hit the spot. They have an incredibly high level of anticipation of what you may want at every moment of the flight.

"  London to Khartoum via Doha on Qatar Airways. My flight from LHR to Doha was on a A350 and its a great plane with very comfortable economy seating and leg room even though I am a large chap, the crew done their job perfectly well and no issues on this flight. I had a 2hr layover at Hamad International and it is a great airport and the transfer was smooth and efficient. The flight to Khartoum was on a A320 from a remote stand so a bus journey to the plane ensure and the seats on this was somewhat smaller and although not entirely uncomfortable was a bit squeezed in. The food served was 2 pastries, one sweet and one savoury which felt a bit weird. Landing at what is probably one of the worst airports in Africa was smooth and no issues with luggage. The return flight a week later, the plane was delayed for 2hrs with no a information from Qatar Airways or airport staff and Qatar ground staff did finally appear when boarding was announced they blamed the delay on no gates being available at the airport, no apologies or anything. I found the plane not very clean, rather old and had no IFE apart from overhead screens. No delay apology was made by the Captain and the food served was spicy lamb meatballs with dill rice which was a bit of a weird meal for what was supposed to be a 2am departure and on arrival at Doha we was once again at a remote stand and bussed to the terminal where I had a 1 1/2hr transit. The flight to London was on a A380 and the seating was very comfortable and the service from the crew was good although the food was terrible. - some sort of scrambled egg, dry frankfurter and some sauteed mushrooms and the snack served prior to landing was chicken in some sort of flat bread wrap that was bland.

Outstanding service by the flight crew and food as usual. Used the Le Meridien airport hotel for an overnight stay at each end and very satisfied with it. The only major issue with Cairo airport is the lack of transport between terminals - always an adventure. Went through about half a dozen security check points throughout the airport - most I've ever experienced. Everyone at the airport willing to help and friendly. Departed Cairo a bit late even though the airport was pretty ""dead"". Return trip was on an A330-300. Not a good experience compared to the other Qatar Airways aircraft I've flown on (A320, A321, A350, 787, 380). Very cramped and no storage space. Will not use their A330 service again.

Boarding was a little slow I think due to the late arrival of the the aircraft but once on board the crew where responsive polite offering drinks amenity kits and menus. Flight departed around 30 minutes late I was in seat 2A which was very comfortable once airborne meal orders taken drinks offered and an apology for the late departure from the crew manager. Food was pretty good as was the service, I managed some decent sleep during the 9hrs 20min flight the entertainment system was okay but not very responsive. Arrival in Doha on time to a remote stand business class passengers bussed separately to the terminal, I used the Qatar lounge which is very good although huge it feels fine. Boarding from A3 on to the LHR flight was organised I had seat 22A on this flight which I like at the rear of business cabin. Again crew very responsive offering PJs night kits drinks etc. Departed on time although I skipped food and opted for breakfast 2 hours before arrival. I slept for 4 hours of this night flight woke by the crew to a pretty good breakfast about 2 hours out of LHR. Flight arrived almost 1 hour early which was nice bags off quickly I was home within an hour of landing. Great service I prefer the A380 to other Qatar aircraft although not used A350 yet. Better than Virgin,perhaps seat is much better. But my normal carrier BA are miles off the mark compared to Qatar.",Promoter
"  Phuket to Manchester via Doha. I have flown with Qatar Airways many times over the past few years, but will unlikely do so in the future. The planes and seating are first class, as are their cabin crew. Ground staff in Doha were unhelpful and the telephone helpline appalling. The frequent flyer programme was worthless - booking an upgrade turned into a nightmare with unreturned calls, and ended up after calculating price of calls and changes to tickets to have been almost a waste of time.",Passive
  Dammam to Kozhikode return via Doha. I have flown quite a few times with Qatar Airways and they have been very impressive with their service. I would like to highlight one experience i had with them when i last flew with them in February 2017. The return flight from CCJ to DOH did not have a flight entertainment system and I did not get the food i had requested for. The staff are amazing. On my return I tweeted to Qatar Airways regarding the issues I faced and they were quick to respond to my query and assist. They were very apologetic for the mix up regarding the food and also made a reasonable explanation as to why there was no entertainment system on the return flight. They awarded me 3000 QMiles for the inconvenience caused. Thank you Qatar Airways for an amazing experience !,Promoter
"  Colombo to Stockholm via Doha. Colombo to Doha in business class on A340 and not impressed. The seats 2-2-2 setup were not as comfy as I was expecting and did not recline to full flat.

"  Berlin to Denpasar via Doha. Website crashed and prices were inconsistent for me. Closing only via hotline possible. Berlin Airport check in with a long queue. Hand-luggage was weighed. Boeing 777 was new and cramped with a 3x4x3 seat configuration, I saw a little amount of lavatories. Menu was average nothing worth of mentioning. Seat width feels narrow to me. Inflight entertainment ok. Service understaffed to my eyes. Doha Airport was stressful for me, and unwelcoming.

  Dubai to Amritsar via Doha. Flight from Dubai to Doha on A350 was comfortable. Flight Attendant smiling and attentive. Hot Snack Box with OJ is served on this 40 minute flight. Hence a quick busy shuttle flight which landed on time and all was good and efficient. After reaching Doha moved to Departure Hall. Hamad airport is dark and not properly lighten up. Our onward flight to Amritsar was from gate C24 which is on the ground level. The place looks does not provide good travel experience. Boarding started zone wise an hour earlier but still bit chaotic. We are bussed to the aircraft. The aircraft was A321 which is full. The seats were not more than average and feel bit cramped. Refreshing towel pack handed out but no menus were given. Drinks are served with meal but no refill offered. Meal served is not up to 5 star mark and average. It took a long time for flight attendant to serve the meal and to take away trays after finishing the meal. The flight departs at 02:20 am and reaches by 08:15 am. It would be better and appropriate if they serve breakfast on this sector rather than serving dinner. There was a long queue for going to washroom after the meal. The good thing about this flight is that it departed on time and reached on time that too 10 minutes early and inflight entertainment was good.,Passive
"  Amritsar to Dubai via Doha. Flight from Amritsar to Doha on A321 which was well maintained and legroom was good. The boarding started an hour earlier but not done zone wise and took almost 30 minutes to board the plane. No greetings from crew when boarded. The A321 is full and it would be better, if they deploy a bigger aircraft. The flight attendants were just doing their job and not smiling. Refreshing towel pack handed out and menus were given. Drinks served with meal but no refill offered. Meal served out of Amritsar was not up to 5 star mark and very average dinner. Veg Biryani with one small teaspoon of lentils and tasted bland. Desert of Mango Kheer tasted better. The main course is small. No tea or coffee served after the meal and you have to ask for this. Inflight entertainment was good. But the touch screen option takes longer time to do the action assigned. The good thing about this flight is that it departed 10 minutes before time and reached 20 minutes ahead of its scheduled arrival time. On reaching Doha, bussed to the arrival hall which is just 5 minutes ride. As there is no other flight arrival quickly pass through security for transits and then straight to departure hall. Flight to Dubai on A321 was comfortable. Flight attendants were smiling, attentive and doing their job with passion. Considering it a 5 star airline, no water or welcome drink was served, but a hot snack Box with OJ is served on this 40 minute flight.

"  Flew on Business class with Qatar from Athens to Tokyo Haneda via Doha. First leg of the flight was on a A320 with the old layout of business class seats which are the worst from what Qatar has to offer as they don't go into bed mode and aren't as nice as the newer ones, but it was ok for a 4.5 hour flight. Service was good and so was the food offered. On the second leg of the flight we flew on the Boeing 787. Indeed a spectacular aircraft with great layout, vey comfortable seats. The amenities given along with slippers, and pyjamas were top quality. The staff were very attentive and again everything was perfect from start to finish, Can't fault it.",Promoter
"  Dammam to Manila return via Doha. I have been flying with Qatar Airways, particulary on the Boeing 777-300ER from Doha to Manila, for a couple of years now in business class with much satisfaction. Each year, some additional nuances are added to make the flight more pleasurable. This last flight was on seat 2A (Dammam-Doha, A330-200) and 2K (Doha-Manila-Doha, B777-300ER) and 2A (Doha-Dammam, A320). Cabin crew make extra efforts to provide passenger's needs anytime. Food options are very good. One note however, I still prefer the Armani amenity kit of the past rather than the latest one. I suppose Qatar Airways would like to consider utilizing a newer aircraft on certain days like the A350 or Boeing 787-8 on their Manila route (or Southeast Asian route generally).",Promoter
"  Munich to Colombo via Doha with Qatar Airways. The check-in on Munich Airport was very fast and easy, but the first flight was operated on a LATAM Brasil A350, which was less comfortable than proper Qatar aircraft. The meal aswell as the service on board was quite good, but not better compared to other airlines. Doha Airport was really great and modern, but because of the big delay, I didn't have that much time on the airport. The second flight was pretty similar to the first one, but luckily it was operated by a Qatar Airways A340-600 and the legroom there was pretty huge.

"  Madrid to Manila via Doha. Our inbound Iberia flight was delayed. It was a race against time. Upon deplaning, to the luggage belt and me up to the check in counter for our flight to Doha on Qatar Airways. When I got to the Business Class check-in counter, I was told that the check in was closed and she will have to see if her supervisor would allow us. At that point, my partner was still getting our bags out. I had to beg. It was such a low point that I had no choice but to do it. The check in staff told me to inform my partner to leave the bags behind, so i sent him a text. He arrived a few moments later. After checking in two bags and missing one, my partner gave the QR check in staff all the Iberia luggage tags for them to arrange whatever they could to send the missing bag to Manila. She asked for my email and she then promised to communicate via email. She escorted us to security clearance. Then after the checks, we ran, took the train to get to Terminal 4s. Upon reaching the terminal, we had to clear immigration, showed the staff the fast track, got cleared and we ran to Gate R-18. Gasping for air, we reached the gate. Boarding was about to finish. We made it in the nick of time. Sweltering in our sweat, the boarding staff informed us that two of our bags made it as well. When I try to look back, I gave ourselves allowance of almost three hours for our flight to Manila. Should Iberia did not bump us off, all should've gone smoothly as planned. I don't know what the purpose of OneWorld now is. It promises smooth travels with its partner Airlines. What for is the frequent flyer status when one is placed in situations such as this. I tell you, no monetary amount could compensate the distress that my partner and I had to undergo due to Iberia's shortcoming. When we got to Manila, Qatar Airways Ground Services was holding a placard with our names on it. We approached him and he told us that the QR agent in Madrid sent them an email regarding our missing luggage and that they would do their best to locate it and have it delivered to us. I hope I would get to hear from them soon and I hope OneWorld gets to do something about this. On the other hand, I would always commend Qatar Airways for their efficiency and for its impeccable service. They have always been reliable. To the QR check in staff who assisted us, I was not able to get your name at that time but I would always be thankful for making it possible for us to get on our flight. You deserve my commendation for a job well done.",Promoter
"  Flew Qatar Airways. Aircraft used on Vienna - Doha route was a fairly new Boeing 787. The cabin looked modern and neat, the cabin lighting set a soothing and relaxed atmosphere on board. Seats were quite comfortable, legroom was okay but overall the seat width felt narrow and cramped. Cabin crew were very professional and friendly. Meal quality was good given the cabin flown but in comparison to other airlines, the amount of drinks offered was insufficient in relation to the length of the flight. The in-flight entertainment offered was good, although the system was not intuitive and touchscreen seemed to react slow. Liked the goodie of 15 minutes complimentary on-board wi-fi!",Passive

"  Ho Chi Minh City to Pnom Penh. Check-in with Qatar Airways is always a blessing and takes seconds. Lounge in Ho Chi Minh City is very good (Apricot, 3rd part lounge) since renovation recently. I was the only visitor for the entire 3 hours when I was there. Food options delicious, drinks OK, but the wines were useless. Good catering and pre-departure drinks, but the flight is so short that there is no food provided and no food is available except some sweet cookies and nuts. FAs were kind and gave me extraordinarily a free amenity kit as I inquired for - but these are normally not given on short flights. Flight was early and arrived 20 Minutes ahead of schedule. I will travel economy on this route next time as the flight seems always empty. Or, go by the big detour with Malaysia Airlines over Kuala Lumpur for much less (if campaign prices).",Promoter

Marco Polo Lounge in Venice with a nice design and typically Italian but basic food options. A330-200 with the older type of seats, which are in my opinion, although many writers here disagree, very comfortable and no problem to find several hours of sleep. It has not to be totally flat! A380 seat comfort a little better, more personal space and also good sleeping fully flat sleeping position. The only thing I would advise Qatar Airways to review and find a better supplier, is the coffee, awful on both legs.",Promoter

"  Manila Clark to Madrid via Doha. This was the first time for us to fly out of Doha. We utilized the complimentary shuttle service at the Trinoma pick up point. There were just a handful of passengers so the bus ride was fine. Check in at CRK airport was okay although there was a glitch in terms of the seat assignment. When I purchased the tickets, I made sure seat assignments were reserved and confirmed. Unfortunately, when we get to the check in counter, we were assigned different seats on our DOH-MAD leg. I find it exasperating as my partner and I were traveling together yet we were situated in seats far from each other. What's the point of pre-selecting seats? Past the immigration clearance and security checks, we headed to the lounge. Lounge was pretty basic. A meagre selection of snacks and refreshments. Air-conditioning was way too cold. Whiled away the time at the waiting area. Boarding came, there was no system in place. Boarding queue was chaotic. Premium passengers were overtaken by coach passengers. Anyhow, in-flight service was superb. The cabin crew took heed of my specific requests. It was great as it was dining-on demand. Meal service was spotless. I had to stay up the whole flight to shun away from jetlag. Thanks to binge watching Modern Family and Friends on Oryx.",Promoter

"  Birmingham to Cape Town via Doha. Traveling with wife and 2 young kids, very impressed with the Boeing 787 from Birmingham. Was concerned about 17.3"" seat but no need. Very comfortable flight all around and was able to use my cpap machine for sleep apnoea in flight with no issues which was why I chose the Qatar option in first place (787s all the way). Only criticism would be the IFE touch screen was very sluggish and the children's meals were drab plus no play packs for kids. On arrival at Doha had long walk carrying kids. Then found the Boeing 787 to Cape Town changed at last minute to Boeing 777-300. There was an air of frantic rush here as we were herded on plane when we should have departed. The seats were so unfortunately and no power for my medical equipment. Unlike previous flight staff did not know of my medical request and so I had a horrendous flight with no sleep. Again kids meal were drab and left though IFE worked better. Overall the Boeing 787 was brilliant and justified my route a choice but Boeing 777 cancelled this out.",Passive
"  Barcelona to Bangkok return via Doha. Economic reality dictates these days that my QR flying has now to be in Economy, not Biz. Both BCN sectors were in A330, which, though a little dated are a perfectly acceptable plane for a 6 hr flight. Still nice to have the 2-4-2 layout that enables a couple travelling to be able to sit by themselves. Doha to BKK was in an A380, which is a wonderful plane. The little Economy sector on the upper deck is as good as it gets in Economy, in my opinion, with great seats, and plenty of space, but from what I saw, the lower deck is almost as good. Which is why I was so disappointed when I found out that the Bangkok to Doha section was changed to a B777 300. What a come-down, QR felt fit to follow the trend of 3-4-3 in Economy, instead of the 3-3-3 . This cabin is seriously cramped. It was impossible to pass in the aisle if there was a large person or trolley in it, and no elbow room to eat etc in any seat. These people need to get the message that they cannot go squeezing yet more seats into already overcrowded jets to make a fast buck. Cannot speak for other carriers, but the difference on QR between their A380 offering and the 773 offering is embarrassing.",Passive

"  London to Denpasar Bali via Doha, returning Jakarta to London via Doha. Outbound on A330 and inbound on the Boeing 787. After a horrendous journey through London to get to Heathrow, I was escorted to the front of the check-in queue and allowed to use Business Class check-in to make the 1 hour cutoff for my flight. Overnight flight from London to Doha was on time and unremarkable other than for some bizarre reason the main cabin lights were not switched off during the flight. Fortunately Qatar's economy amenities kit is good and features an eyemask, which was needed on this occasion. Legroom in seat 20K was poor due to the IFE box under the seat in front. Food was good and cabin crew were very polite. Hot towels served on boarding and in the morning which is a nice touch. The really good Qatar service came on transfer in Doha. After freshening up I made my way to the boarding gate for the Doha-Bali leg, to find an incredibly long queue for what was clearly a full flight. At the boarding gate, the agent switched my boarding pass and only after passing through the gate did I realise he had upgraded me to business class! The onboard business class service was impeccable. The seats were clean, had multiple recline positions and plenty of room to store belongings you wanted access to in-flight. There was a good pre-flight drinks service (including champagne), the amenities kit was excellent (featuring Armani products) and the cabin crew were the most polite and attentive I've ever encountered. Throughout the flight there was an on-demand meal service, superb wine list (including a Sauternes dessert wine) and the bathrooms were cleaned by a member of cabin staff after every use by a passenger. Absolutely faultless service. What's more, I did not feel that the staff treated me any differently just because I had the fortune to have been upgraded for free instead of having paid full price for the experience. Return flights in economy were very good and better than the outbound LHR-DOH leg: this had a lot to do with the Boeing 787 plane, which had far better lighting and more spacious seats, which made sleeping far easier. I had a window seat and appreciate the tinted window function on the Dreamliner. Again, cabin crew were excellent and the food was very good for economy class. IFE options were very good. Ground staff and gate agents on transfer in Doha some of the politest I've ever encountered. Overall, very impressed with the service that Qatar offers, and would certainly consider using them again flying to Asian destinations if the price is competitive with (e.g.) Singapore Airlines.",Promoter
"  New York to Bangkok via Doha. The food was among the worst I've had on a major carrier. It took a long time for them to remove our trays, over 30 mins after serving. The snacks were paltry and seats were no more than average. It was about the best entertainment system I've seen on long haul flights. My pillow went below my bottom instead of my head the seat was so uncomfortable. The flights from Doha to Bangkok had particularly bad food, no middle eastern food was offered which I found strange. My chicken and potatoes with vegetables reminded me of a discount meal. The lounge had good food and a nice shower, but had a smoking room coupled with poor ventilation.

To avoid this I use Belgium, Germany or even Skandinavian as starting point for my trip, since Qatar Airways uses the 787 or new A350 to Doha. I was unpleasantly surprised to find out that Qatar Airways uses a leased A350 from LATAM on their Doha-Munich route. The config in business class in this plane is 2-2-2 and more cramped than the 777. Toilets were messy, service below par and sitting near the window means climbing over your fellow passenger.

The seat is great and the 1-2-1 Business cabin is cosier than Qatar's A350 or 380. It left right on time. The Doha to London sector was a 777 with an older 2-2-2 layout and product, which my partner and I are usually quite happy with. But it does look and feel dated, compared with the latest Qatar Airways Business product. My seat seemed to dangle at the end, so didn't go completely flat. Still, this aircraft type will shortly be retrofitted with Qatar's latest Q Suite. Catering was good, in that as an alternative to the main breakfast offering, there were also several delicious alternatives. Cabin crew were excellent.

"  My last flight from Doha to New York JFK was disappointing. Upon boarding, a couple in Business Class insisted to have their child, booked in Economy, upgraded and made a scene when it could not be arranged. In the process, several passengers were asked to change seats, some accepting and some not. The FAs stood by. The old Business Class seats in Boeing 777s are well below those found elsewhere. The food and amenity kits have been very downgraded. The winesremain very good. If you happen to like dark chocolate, you are not in luck. The boxes of four have been replaced by single milk pieces. The robot-like unsmiling service (with the exception of the perfectly charming Flight Service Director who acknowledged the facts and wrote her own report) was performed with no grace. Call buttons had to be pressed several times to be acknowledged. My IFE handset was unreliable, touch screen on the main video is too far to be easily accessed. In Doha, I found food availability and service in the Business Class lounge badly reduced. None of this is tragic and I very much realize the ""Let them eat cake"" aspect of such criticism.",Passive

I had the chance to compare the B787 and A350 here, and the 350 wins with flying colors.

"  Kuala Lumpur to Copenhagen via Doha in March 2017. The ticket was the return travel on an extremely cheap economy ticket purchased for less than 500 USD several months prior to travel. Despite the ticket is in O-class, and thus not upgradable, they sent me an offer 2 weeks before to pay 400 USD extra for the last sector to CPH. I could not resist as this also gave me access to Al Mourjan Lounge in Doha, where I spent 15 hours, which I don't mind. First sector: in Kuala Lumpur I tried all 3 lounges offered (Plaza Premium, Golden Business, and First Class). All were good. As the flight was only 30-40% full and as I am elite flyer they gave me 4 seats on the A340-600 to stretch out. In economy I was pampered throughout. Special meal accommodated and other meals offered. Drink rounds very, very frequent and staff super alert. IFE fine. At arrival in Doha only bus transport available to Terminal. Second flight on a Boeing 787-8, flight on time. Contact-gate in Doha. That makes things much easier and allowed for leaving the lounge late as the walk took only 5 Minutes from lounge to aircraft. Good service onboard, despite business class was full. Good food, excellent wines, poor beers. It annoys me that they request charity support from passengers for the â€œEducate a Childâ€ charity. They want people to put money in envelopes onboard! I find this extremely intrusive and disrespectful to passengers.",Promoter

The seating was 3x4x3 and there were plenty of toilets. The flight attendants were attentive without being overwhelming. Altogether a good flight. The Colombo to Doha sector on an A340 with 2x4x2 seat configuration had a few problems. Although I had checked in online I had to join the queue to drop my bag off. I could not see the point of checking-in online. The check-in/bag drop girl spoke in phrases and not in sentences. Boarding was rather chaotic but I presume that this is mostly to do with the airport staff at Colombo. The flight departed 1 hour and 10 minutes late after boarding and because of a thunderstorm.

Chief of cabin talked Portuguese, made us feel confortable with the delay, the Boeing 787 is a fantastic plane lots of seat space and does not seem to end the trip so tired. The inflight entertainment stills has a way to go against the competitors",Promoter
"  Nice boarding in Madrid, very nice flight but flight attendent seems to be flying for the first time. My wife asked for a Low Fat Meal, we had to tell her both times that we had that meal, because somehow she seems to forget, nevertheless she had the seat number on the tray. This was on the Madrid to Doha Flight, the flight to Hong Kong was regular but I like the IFE better on Emirates, better tech on the Qatar but less choice.",Promoter
"  Bangkok to Frankfurt via Doha. Before my flight, I have spoken to their Twitter. They respond within an hour, and if they don't, they apologise. During check in, it was chaotic and took me an hour. I understand since it's the big A380. The staff was nice, and answered all my questions. Apparently, the flight was overbooked. After tweeting this, Qatar airways was more than apologetic. Boarding was orderly, and a flight attendant greeted me at the door. When I got to my row, I met a Canadian flight attendant who started conversations with everyone and did this throughout the flight if she wasn't busy. She was very polite. Actually, all the flight attendants were polite and smiling. All of my flights left slightly late. The seat is comfortable however I had the last row so I had limited recline. Seats on the A380 and A350 are the same, and are very wide and comfortable. Legroom is sufficient for a 13 hour flight. One thing I would suggest they add would be a footrest. The TV screen is big, and touch screen responsive, rendering the remote useless. The food onboard was excellent. On the legs to and from Bangkok, The flight attendants saved a meal choice just for us. Try to choose the beef. Most of the time they have braised beef and potatoes, or spiced chicken. They are a bit sluggish, but still smile whenever they're interacting with passengers. I found the red wine to be low quality. I didn't like all of the audio selections, but at least they had 5 Celine Dion and 4 Michael Jackson albums, which kept me entertained. Movie selection is good. During deplaning, the flight attedant gave me a tour of the upper deck including the bar, business and first class. During transit in Doha, security check is much more organised than Taipei or Narita airport, but there a rude staff member at gate check who refused to let me board with my friend who was a Gold card member. On the return flight, I met a nice lady at check in who was having conversations with me and appreciated me trying to speak French. During flight, one Romanian attendant asked me to help translate, and she was very friendly and had conversations with me. On the flight to bangkok, there was a Malaysian flight attendant who was also very nice and talkative (I'm also talkative) so we had too much conversation, she wasn't able to service other passengers. Overall, an amazing experience unlike any other airline. I look forward to flying Qatar Airways business class in the future, when I save up!",Promoter
"  Doha to Riyadh. Excellent service, comfort, food and quality of aircraft. Shame it was only an hours flight. Were one of the first to board and were given hot towels and welcome drink.

"  London Heathrow to Doha. Business Class in the A350 most the best compared to its competitors. The service from check in to the lounge up to the gate was excellent. Staff were very apologetic of the short delay from London and again due to missing out on the pre takeoff drink, which was offered to me after takeoff the air hostess apologised for the inconvenience. This aircraft has a 2 class configuration (Economy and Business) and they take customer service to the next level. Food was great and actually tasted great for airline food, especially the dessert.

I found the food horrible. Crew was very nice. Arrival in Doha on time. The connecting flight was almost 3 hrs late due to late incomming aircraft. A Boeing 787, narrow seats, (entertainment box under some seats, plugs for headphones hidden in armrest). Same bad food for me, and very nice crew. Return flights were similar aircraft types with the same topics. I found the constant noise from the on/off signals for seat belts on a night flight quite annoying.

"  Travelled Qatar Airways from Copenhagen - Doha - Kuala Lumpur on 4th and 5th March 2017. Flights on time. Excellent trips and service top notch. It can hardly get better in economy. Staff caring, respectful, trying to pamper me at great lengths. Check-in cooperative and discussed opportunities for upgrade which I eventually could not as my ticket was extremely much discounted (purchased through global sale). Lounge used in CPH is the Aspire, which is rubbish but QR are now negotiating with the new Lounge â€œAdventureâ€ to change which could be a big boost. I was acknowledged as Platinum card holder on board and got extremely good attendance throughout. They prepared a special starter for me with rice-salad and cheese and wine. Drinks ad libitum, now only 1 white and 1 red wine available and no champagne. These 2 wines were â€“ to my taste â€“ extremely good. The white wine was South African produced from Pinot Gris grapes with an extremely rich taste. Were given 2 hot meals on both legs. They were all different, tasty, and good. The fact portions were small was outweighed by generous additions when requested. Flights not full and I could sleep stretched out on 3 seats on each leg. Flights only 500 USD (return ticket).",Promoter
"  Bangkok to Copenhagen via Doha on 1st/2nd March 2017. Flights on time. Check-in a pleasure. FAs on top of things and one gets pampered with a good focus on each passengers despite business class were full on both flights. Food and drinks kept good standards though have slipped a little bit. Wines onboard are excellent, however, their beers are lousy, extremely boring, and all alike â€“ seems to be a sad trademark of QR. Dine on demand seems to have caused smaller portions without proper stable food (other than accompanying bread). FAs on the last sector (to CPH) were much less professional and uncertain on how to please passengers as compared to FAs on the BKK-DOH sector. Al Mourjan lounge in Doha is very good. Very cheap ticket purchased during their â€global saleâ€ in May 2016, almost a year earlier. Miles were very generous due to unexpected, additional promotions (that I randomly ran in to as they were not there when ticket was purchased) and instantly credited to my account. My Priv. Club card was instantly upgraded to Platinum even before landing in Copenhagen. This I would call for a pleasant and soft landing. IFE good, amenity kit replaced by new brand, lovely. I got pyjamas on night sectors. Bar on A380 was lively, likely due to fully loaded cabins. Headphones good. Qatar Airways delivers.",Promoter
"  Denpasar to London Heathrow via Doha. The seats on this aircraft were very comfortable and the staff were second to none. I flew on an A380 and a Boeing 777-300ER, the leg room is better than other airlines in economy. The staff could not have done enough, on my flight from DOH to DPS I was sat in the middle with 4 other men, broad shoulders, so they upgraded me to business! I will be flying this airline again long haul as I think they are one of the best carriers out there in terms of leg room and routes. My only complaint would be that the meals are rather small, so you might be hungry during the flight. I only paid Â£350 for my flight from London to Bali return so exceptional value too.",Promoter
"  London to Lahore return via Doha. Outward London to Doha 777 left on time, flight full, more room in seats than other carriers, food average. Doha to Lahore A330 far from new. Flight full, seats less comfortable, breakfast served was edible but not outstanding. A320 from Islamabad to Doha upgraded to business class as connection time was tight and plane was full. Full meal served and what a difference both in cabin crew attitude and food quality which was excellent. Doha to London, A350 rushed to make connection and no aircraft at the stand. Flight delayed by 2.5 hours but no reason given. A350 with hard seats but wider and more leg room. Plane was modern and flight quieter than with 777. Meal served was average. Apology for delay from Captain on landing at Heathrow 2.5 hours late. IFE was good throughout.",Passive
  Dubai to Manila return via Dubai. Both flights on time. Decided to change my seat to exit row 25H and was assisted upon arriving in Doha through their transfer desk. Staffs are helpful in Hamad airport. While on board everything is ok. Meals are fine. Returning check in was smooth at Manila. Terminal 1 of MNL is not as chaotic as before. Departed and arrived on time in both sectors. Cabin crews are more helpful and professional compared to the previous flight. Inflight meals are better also maybe because it depends on the catering providers on each destination. Overall it was a wonderful flight.,Promoter

"  Krabi to Munich via Doha. The meal is only average. Sometimes they offered a menu list with options but on other long-haul flights they didn't seem to. They did not distinguish between their vegan, vegetarian, low-carb, no-milk meals and have one low-calories meal for all meatless options. So while others get a cake, you get fruits, when others get a yoghurt, you get a low-fat yoghurt. There is also an inflight entertainment box under the window seats, which makes the flight uncomfortable. If you are flying the old A330, there is no USB connection and we could not charge our mobile phones. The A330 IFE did not have touchscreen control and headphones were of poor quality.",Passive

Everything was okay, the food was excellent as were the wines, and the staff is very kind! Also stop in Doha was a pleasant experience. We visit it a couple off times but stil amazing lounge. The next flight Doha to Bangkok with the A380 that's different, the business class is so big, We fly 3 times with a A380 but everytime we try a different seat but is so crouwded so chaotic with the staff. Don't get me wrong,the food is very good, staff is friendly, but there are to many guests, they can't give good service! For the rest it's good value for your money. We will fly Qatar Airways anyway.",Promoter
"  Flew Doha to Johannesburg. Qatar has one of the best business class products. 6 seats across on the B777 seem to be tight, but even if you have a window seat, you do not have to step over your neighbor as there is so much space between the rows. As always, the catering out of Doha is exceptional, and the wine list leaves nothing to be desired. The crew were excellent, and I really like that you can eat when you want, and whatever you want on the menu at anytime. The pyjamas were the last touch that made this night flight great. I cannot wait to try the A350 as the guy next to me told me that they are the ultimate plane in business class on the Qatar Airways fleet. Also, if you are flexible, the Qatar business class fares can be a bargain compared to other airlines.",Promoter
"  Doha to Auckland. Having flown 7hrs with Qatar from Edinburgh to Doha with a quick change to this 16hr 30 minute flight I was concerned that it would feel very uncomfortable being on such a long flight. I'm happy to say It was not. You just relax into it, especially in business class. This is a wide bodied aircraft which felt quite spacious in business having 6 seats to the row and a large personal tv screen for all the movies. The food was fantastic - having had a beef meal on the previous flight, I chose a Nobu lightly spicy broth with seafood followed by a fabulous red snapper, saffron cream and asparagus and the wines worthy of this airline which was deservedly voted having the best wine cellar in the sky. (Ch. Brane Cantanac red, fine Chablis and Babich Sauvignon from Marlborough NZ). Best of all was the flexibility about when to eat and being such a long flight, there was a constant supply of bottled water, cups of tea and snacks. The seating arrangement works well with easy access to the aisles although a little more storage space for the things we want beside us on a long haul flight would have been more helpful. The cabin crew were charming and no request was too much trouble. I would have no hesitation in flying this longest scheduled flight route in the world again.",Promoter

"  Sydney to Vienna via Doha and returning from London to Sydney via Doha with Qatar Airways. This was a mixed Business/Economy fare (which was really good value) with Sydney to Doha in Business and Economy onwards to Vienna and the same back to Doha from London. I unwittingly got to travel in all three classes and can only say positive things about this airline. Business Class from Sydney to Doha was great really nice cabin and seat, well thought out with loads of storage space. The wine selection was also outstanding (I am a wine buff), food a bit more average. A really good flight and the lounge in Doha is excellent, if a little hard to find. Business felt like a real 'treat' and was a really nice way to start a holiday. Economy to and from Europe was decent enough - but especially coming back in the A380. Try and get a seat upstairs at the back of Business - small cabin with it's own toilets and only about 8-10 rows. I managed to score the front row so had heaps of leg room. From Doha back to Sydney they upgraded me to First from Business - what a treat! The Krug and caviar went down a treat and every aspect of the flight was excellent. I was really impressed by Qatar Airways and feel it is superior to both Qantas and Emirates.",Promoter
"  Medina to Istanbul via Doha. Our flight was overbooked from Medina when we got to the airport. We were told that only 3 of the 6 passengers could board the flight. We had a layover in Doha for a day so the connection time wasn't an issue. The check in staff told us that we came late to check in but then we argued that it doesn't mean that you can check in 3 passengers and can't check in the other 3 as we all came at the same time. Then they told us the truth that the flight was overbooked after 20 minutes and they said the next 3 flights are fully booked. So 3 of the passengers boarded the flight and the other 3 including me stayed at Madina airport. The Qatar airways manager was very calm and helpful. He put us on the next flight which was in 4 hours, gave us free lounge access and gave us compensation more that what we bought the ticket for. The flight from Medina to Doha was pleasant, food was nice, atmosphere was calm, and there was good in flight entertainment. The second flight to Istanbul was even better with more of a choice of food, inflight entertainment, and WiFi onboard which was working well. Overall the service by the cabin crew was brilliant and I would definitely recommend Qatar airways.",Promoter
"  Bangkok to Doha, 09 Feb 2017, Economy Class seat 026D Airbus A380. Flight attendants and staff are excellent and genuine. Onboard the A380 you have a comfortable seat with satisfactory legroom (32 inches) and generous width (18,5 inches). Frequent flyers are seated on the upper desk, and usually may be assigned their favorite seat number, if they ask for it. Overall, flying the A380 with QR is an excellent experience. We just hope that Qatar Airways will keep their generous seat width (18,5) on the A380, and will not shift to a 17 width seat, as on their B777 (10 seats abreast).",Promoter
"  Madrid to Taif via Doha. I normally fly this airline if they have the route. I will overfly my destination and give myself a layover in Doha because they are were so good. I arrived with my 11 year old son very early for check in Madrid. So much so they were still checking in the early flight to Doha. QR 150 not 152. But they checked me in early superb service from the check in staff. A male boarding supervisor came and destroyed 8 years of perfect customer satisfaction in a few minutes. He informed me that I was welcome to use the silver lounge pass but my 11 year old son (minor) was not. This cost was incurred by Qatar Airways and despite he being registered as a minor family member he would not be able to use the facilities in Madrid as they cost Qatar Airways too much money and they had to pay for this service. A family member and a minor. He then confidently called the previous female supervisor who Qatar Airways should be very proud to have a an employee for her courteous and professional demeanor and manner who promptly over-ruled his decision and issued my 11 year old (minor) accompanying passenger to sit with his only accompanying passenger in the Iberia VIP lounge in terminal 4s. Having flown no airline but Qatar Airways for the last 7-8 years occasionally overflying my destination and having long layovers in one of the nicest airports in the world this will no longer be the case as matter of course. There are choices. When I become a burden of inconvenience for my loyalty as a customer then something happened to the overall picture. The flight was OK. Night flight nothing special other than the fasten seat belts sign was illuminated for the duration of the meal service and collection of trays, with no Turbulence. I look forward to returning to the best standards achievable in my next flight. The numerical assessment reflects my belief this was a one off by people / individuals having a bad day and professional people rectifying the issues after much deliberation. Hence still recommended. Doha to Taif was perfect as always. Except having bought a Qatar Airways ticket found myself on an Al Maha badged aircraft (internally) with no IFE.

Need to modernize and refurbish these no IFE on any flight nowadays is really not acceptable especially for an airline of this standard. Other than that very nice flight with attentive flight crews good food and good service. 10 hour wait in Doha. Hotel entitlement is not automatic even though when booking they say they will accommodate. So we saw our co-passenger off and spent an extremely pleasant and long wait in Hamad airport. Access to the Oneworld / Silver lounge. This is not the Business class lounge used by Qatar business ticketed passengers. Nevertheless very pleasant stay, well staffed and good food. Sleeping room was great were we spent most of our time in between eating. The flight on the Boeing 787 from Doha to Madrid was excellent. Very food IFE. Nice flight, good connectivity.

"  Copenhagen to Bangkok via Doha. My last flight our prebooked seats were given to other passengers. This was solved after long discussion at the airport check in. Then our Priority tags on our suitcases were removed somewhere between check in and loading to aircraft. So we had to wait nearly an entire A380 flight baggage to be delivered before getting our so called Priority bags. Our connecting flight from DOH to BKK was delayed about 6 hours, so we spent the night at DOH airport. They started out with a 3 hour delay, and later when the first 3 hours was nearly elapsed the delay was changed to 6 hours. Qatar Airways has a rule to give hotel accommodation if the delays is 6 hours or more, but of course we did not get this. It was a disaster trip.",Passive

"  Philadelphia to Denpasar Bali via Doha. Before choosing Qatar Airways for our flight to Bali, I studied many, many reviews of a number of different airlines which led to my choosing Qatar Airways for our flight to Bali. I booked these tickets myself online, so was a bit anxious about any hitches that might occur, since this was the first time for both a flight of this magnitude and my unfamiliarity with this airline. I am so very happy I chose them because of the many flights I have taken, both inside the US and internationally, Qatar Airways currently has my vote as the best - for service, for seating and for overall efficiency and pleasant travel. Check-in, both in the US and in Bali was exceptional: Fast, efficient and friendly. I am mobility-impaired, and need a wheelchair for distances in the airport. I cannot stress the exceptional quality of care that was given to me, from the point of entry into the Qatar area. Not only in terms of fast, friendly transport through check-in, customs, security and onto the planes, but once I was entered into their system as mobility-impaired at the first airport, we were upgraded to more comfortable seating: very helpful. Service on the planes was impeccable. Staff was friendly, attentive (note, these were almost 13 and 10 hour flights, so staff were on for long hours) to requests and periodically checked, even if no requests were made. I pre-ordered meals (not necessary, I discovered unless you really do want special meals) and was able to change the request while in-flight. Meals, both vegetarian and non-vegetarian options, were tasty (on the way out particularly, featured a lot of protein), were plentiful and beautifully served.

"  Abu Dhabi to Hong Kong via Doha. Qatar Airways is definitely above the other Gulf airlines for me. I was a frequent flyer with Etihad Airways (which disappointed me a lot during the last years) but decided to give a try to Qatar Airways.

"  Paris CDG to Doha. Qatar Airways is such a nice airline to fly with. From the check in experience until the arrival is amazing, however it has a few flaws. From the check in, they checked me all the way to Kuala Lumpur, everything went nice and smooth. I am Indonesian living in Jakarta so ground staff asked me that if I do have the ticket to Jakarta or not and I explained I want to spend time in Kuala Lumpur and have the ticket to CGK. Here's a little tip, I recommend that you guys should check-in via web since Qatar Airways provided a faster lane for web check-in users, however they still print the boarding pass so it's no need to print on your own, you just only have to complete your personal info. Hence after check-in, I directly headed to the boarding gate, it has no problem and everything went smooth. Boarding to the aircraft, I was greeted by the warmf flight attendants. Our seat located on the front was shown by the FA. My sister wanted to take a pic with the FA and she is very nice and friendly to her. Before departure, my sister which is 10 yo was given a colorful monopoly bag with board games for entertainment. However after 10 minutes taxiing, the aircraft was going back to the gate due to some trouble (which wasn't told to the passenger) and we had a delay of an hour, so that they gave us free water or juice. After 1.5 hours taxiing, we finally leave Paris. Inside the A380, the seat is quite different with the A340s and 777s of Qatar, it has the neck rest. It is actually quite good for me, a person taller than 5'7"", however it could be a disaster for a person with lower height. The cabin crew handed out dinner. The meal was pretty awesome and had a rich taste (keep in mind that arabian food has lots of spices in their food which is great). Another thing is that I can actually fill a water bottle to make me keep hydrated even when i remain seated so that i do not need to call the fa for some drinks. After the meal, I discover the in-flight entertainment and it was pretty cool. The screen was big and it was very responsive (in comparasion to the 777s of Qatar's). It also have the mini PDA-like remote which is very responsive. Qatar Airways offer new movies, and I watched 2 new movies during this sector. However, the A380s doesn't seem to have wider collections rather than the 777s. During the flight, free wi-fi for economy passengers is offered for a limit (15 minutes, 10MB). The internet connection was horrible however I manage to chat with a few people though. 2 hours prior to landing, served a snack and coffee. Also during the hours we suffer some turbulences but the cabin crew manage to handle professionally. What I like during the flight is that I feel the A380s are very quiet in comparason to the 777s so that we could rest. Overall, it was an awesome flight.",Promoter
"  Doha to London Heathrow, economy class on B787. Having flown the A380 on my outbound flight, this aircraft felt a little cramped particularly for seat width.

"  Frankfurt to Cape Town via Doha. I normally use Etihad or Turkish from Frankfurt to South Africa. First time Qatar Airways Business Class and very happy with it. On the shorter leg Frankfurt-Doha they use their youngest fleet of Boeing 787 and A350, both equipped with the most spacious and luxurious seats I have ever sat in. Lots of legroom, lots of room to stow away your belongings. Even pajamas in Business class during night flights. Only flaws were the restricted and slow WiFi on board, a very small menu on their night service Doha to Frankfurt with little choice and the lack of a chauffeur service for Business guests. Etihad and Emirates offer this service. Hamad Airport and Qatar Airways lounge facilities at Doha airport are of a breathtaking quality, just splendid. The Cape Town service is flown with Boeing 777-300. Less comfortable, no WiFi, but still competitive for a 5 star airline. The friendliness and attentiveness of all the crew members during all 4 flights was close to perfection. Will definitely fly them again.",Promoter

She changed my second flight and I finally got to my final destination yesterday, although 2 hours later. I would like to thank her for listening calmly and then to offer a different flight. She is a true gem indeed and this reflects well on Qatar Airways. Unlike other transfer staff who didn't listen and just gave us a meal voucher without explaining or listening to the customers. Thanks to her professionalism, this review is getting a decent rating although my second flight was delayed. If only all staff can treat customer as professional and courteous as she did, despite delays and disgruntled customers, Qatar Airways will continue to do well.",Promoter

And the only let down is the Wifi and connection to the iPod to the Oryx system is not working. Second leg (Doha - Kuala Lumpur) I was upgraded to the business class for whatever reason it is (I am not complain). And is my second time in business class, the seat are very comfortable and with the flexibility of meals they provide all were 5 stars quality. You can adjust the seats in the position most comfortable at. I was treat well during the whole journey and leave the plane happily with just minor issues. The place to plug in the earphone and store your belongings (phone, wallet etc) were rather awkward just below and beside the handrest, is bit difficult to plug it or store it. I try to turn the seat into bed position and it was not that comfortable as it is hard. At the end of the day I wish the plane arrive ""a lot later"" as I didn't want my experience in business class end, so I guess that summed how good is the flight.",Promoter
"  My husband and I were flying from Moscow to Bali via Doha. The first segment was okay, but during Doha to Denpasar after 20 minutes of flying we found it is really cold in the cabin. We told the cabin crew about this but it wasn't ok even after two hours. We and the rest of the passengers put on all winter clothing we had and asked the cabin crew to make it warmer at least a little bit. It took five hours of asking to make it warmer in the cabin. I think the cabin crew just did not understand what we were talking about as the galley areas were warmer. They give you a brunch menu but our choice was finished by the time they get to us. I think catering professionals should know how to make all the items in the menu last for all clients. On the positive side the cabin crew were very nice and polite.",Detractor
"  Melbourne to Casablanca via Doha, returning from Barcelona. Very good business class product by Qatar Airways. Boeing 777 from Melbourne offers a very comfortable space. Slept well on both legs, as the cabin was slightly cooler making it comfortable (even through lots of turbulence DOH to MEL). Flight attendants were very attentive on all legs, although they were not quite ready to greet customers on the DOH to MEL flight, but quickly made up for it once on board and seated. Flew on the Dreamliner from Doha to Casablanca and I found it very stuffy. The seating arrangement was ok, but lacked the space of the Boeing 777. Barcelona to Doha, I sat next to a employee of Qatar (I believe a senior member) who was very well cared for by the attendants which as a paying customer was interesting to observe this attentiveness. He is very proud of Qatar Airways and their product which is good to hear the other side. I will be flying with them again in late August and look forward to the experience in the A380.",Promoter
"  This trip has been a mixed bag with the outbound flight from Adelaide to Oslo via Doha being essentially good and without incident. However the return trip open jaw from Barcelona after a cruise was a different matter. The onboard experience on the flight from Barcelona to Doha was good and our hostess for our section of the plane was outstanding, but ground staff at Barcelona left a lot to be desired particularly for business passengers. We arrived before the check in start time and had to wait for staff to arrive and set themselves up. After the check in staff arrived they played with their computers, talked amongst themselves and had a meeting without providing any explanation to waiting of passengers who were left waiting for 30 minutes. When we finally checked in our bags they were tagged as ""long transfer"" routing them direct to Adelaide without any explanation been given of the implications. When we arrived in the early hours of the morning in Doha were we advised by the transfer desk that we could not have access to our checked luggage. Hence we were left without spare clothing, toiletries and essential medications for our less than 24 hour stopover. It was by chance that we had some essential items in our cabin luggage. The transfer desk operative attitude to our predicament was most uncustomer friendly. We believe that Qatar should have informed us of the requirement to pack the items we required for the stopover in our cabin bags when they advised that our booked flight had been changed neccessitating the stop over. The Oryx airline hotel was good but as business passengers we felt that a private car would have been more appropropriate than waiting for a minibus to take us to the hotel. The customer service at the Doha airport for business class passengers is inconsistent with the service around the check in area verging on overkill while after passengers have been processed they are left to wander around the airport in search of the business lounge. Doha to Adelaide was mixed with some cabin staff providing excellent service while others were lazy. I was not offered a mattress or breakfast while my wife on the other aisle received excellent service. I experienced extreme difficulty in having our flights credited to our respective frequent flyer accounts, (which I believe should be automatically recorded when making the booking as the FF codes are shown on our boarding passes). I have sent two emails via the Qatar frequent flyer webpage which have been ignored. Customer service in Australia appears to be non existent! All in all, our experience with Qatar has been disappointing.",Passive
"  I travelled CPH-DOH-BKK on 1st and 2nd January 2017 - on B788 and B77W, respectively. Check-in counter in CPH puzzled me as QR now start to disallow checking in luggage further than the first tickets end-destination. That is a huge downfall as in this case I will have to check in my luggage again in Bangkok â€“ this, despite that my next carrier is their Oneworld alliance member, Malaysia Airlines. That cost me an hour and a half extra struggle in BKK due to cease of this baggage further transfer service â€“ this is an unacceptable change and huge deterioration of service - likely inspired by BA who recently stopped offering further luggage transfers. All flights on time. Poor lounge offered in CPH, a third party lounge called Aspire â€“ likely the most boring lounge in the world. Pre-departure drinks in CPH offered but with soft drinks only. When QR departs from any other Scandinavian Airport like OSL, HEL, or ARN they offer full drink service predeparture â€“ why can't they do it in CPH? Menu had no seafood, fish, or lamb. Icecream offered but they ran out of stock before they reached my seat 4A, despite having initially ordered. No smoothies. Cheeseplate available. Good wines and spirits. 3 beers offered, provide no alternative as they are almost identical and dull in taste (Corona, Heineken, and Foster). FAs did a great job. Lounge in Doha excellent. Second flight DOH-BKK with equipment change due to poor load factor to mobilise the A380 and was changed to an older B777-300ER without 1st class and bar. Pre-departure drinks included champagne. The seats could not go horizontal, only some 165 degrees angle â€“ but were fully flat. Food and drink service excellent and pyjamas and kits were given out. Nice, light breakfast given out close to landing â€“ here I got my beloved smoothie.",Passive

"  Oslo to Bangkok via Doha. The boarding in Oslo was a bit chaotic. The crew welcomed me with a glass of champagne and warm nuts. I was impressed by the amazing cabin of the Boeing 787. After take-off the crew took my orders and service was one of the quickest, unfortunately my meal option went out. But not too bad I then went with the Arabic chicken for main which was amazing, as a starter I chose salmon along with potato salad and for dessert they offered ice cream. The crew was amazing and friendly. They often came and brought chocolate, cookies and drinks. The only thing I wish is free Wi-Fi for Business passengers and for their Elites. Because you pay a lot money and with Wi-Fi you could answer mails or just simply browse the web. The transfer at their Doha hub was quick and well organized. But the line for Business passengers was a bit too full. After that I went to their amazing lounge. The second flight was not as good as the first one. It was departing in the morning and arriving in the evening. They only had breakfast option and no lunch or dinner options. But at least the catered option tasted amazing and were top. The seats on the Boeing 777 fleet are a bit old and when compared to their Boeing 787, A380 and A350. Overall, Qatar Airways is the best airline in Business class service.",Promoter
"  Philadelphia to Bangkok via Doha. This journey was very exciting because I was able to fly on an A350-900. The flight crew was excellent and very attentive to customer needs. The in-flight entertainment system was one of the best, if not the best, that I have encountered with enough entertainment to keep you occupied for a long flight and the touchscreen display worked without any flaws. The food was excellent although I found the presentation of the food to be a bit confusing (perhaps it was just me). The seats were comfortable, and the seat pitch was more than adequate. The overall experience was great, and Qatar Airways lived up to the hype. I would recommend Qatar Airways to anyone.",Promoter
"  Flew Qatar Airways from Perth to London return via Doha in December 2016. Boeing 777 on all legs apart from London to Doha which was an A380. No real complaints about the planes or cabin crew. Entertainment good, good leg room (although I'm only 1.7m). Slimline seats on Boeing 777 actually more comfortable than more traditional seats on the A380 although it seemed like a newer plane. Not too many announcements apart from at beginning and end of flight which is good compared to some carriers constantly trying to sell duty free etc. Main complaint would be the food and drink service. The food was just OK and they are very stingy with alcoholic drinks. They had the small wine bottles (187.5ml) but poured them in to a glass and saved the remaining 50mls or so for the next passenger, this seemed very like cost cutting at its most obvious. Overall, a good value pleasant experience but meal and drink service needs improvement.",Passive

"Delhi to Edinburgh via Doha. I chose Qatar Airways as I was very curious about the Dreamliner that Boeing and many people were talking about. I wanted to feel for myself the spacious layout, the more natural cabin pressure closer to the ground, and the larger colour-changing windows. When I boarded the aircraft, there was a little lounge between the business and the economy classes, so it did feel very spacious. The design of the over-head luggage compartments also made it feel more spacious than other aircraft when you standing in the aisle. Were the windows larger? I was not sure - maybe, as I could see the ground from my aisle seat. There was definitely a difference in the cabin pressure - during taking-off and landing, I did not feel any pain in my ears. The leg room was not tight, but somehow I did not feel it was as comfortable as I was imagining. I just felt lack of support on my back and my feet never feel too relaxed. Also, there was a box under the front seat in all A and C seats (I guess it is the same for the other side, too), taking up quite a lot of space. In terms of the service, it was pretty good. One of my stereo earphone jacks in 19H did not work, so the flight attendants changed me to 20D. The food was OK, but far from amazing. I really enjoyed the omelette and chicken sausage on Flight 579 from Delhi to Doha - the omelette, the sausage and the mushrooms were tender, succulent and full of flavours, but the same dish on QR29 from Doha to Edinburgh was oddly very dry, tough and obviously overcooked. The in-flight entertainment was good - there were 35 new movies to choose from, on top of other older movies. They claimed to offer WiFi on board, but I could not connect to it, or even when I was connected, it was not usable (not even to browse the web). There was phone signal on the plane, though, but I did not try to send a text. Personally, I would rate this journey above average, but I did not think it reached my expectation.",Promoter
"  Stockholm to Bangkok via Doha. Flying about 3-4 times a year with Qatar Airways (12-16 legs) and still like the airline. Very well trained and polite crew, very good cuisine on board, nice wine selection although the choices of champagnes have declined in quality. Two years ago I was able to drink Pol Roger RosÃ© Vintage 2006 and now it is Lanson RosÃ©. Same changes in the variety of food and drinks in the Biz lounge in Doha. Never been my favorite, due to its immense size, it feels more like a train station than a lounge. Another change is the frequency of time changes with Qatar now: My first leg of this trip was changed 4 times back and forward, last time about two weeks before departure date. Inconvenient, because I had a meeting before in Stockholm and had to change my agenda and that of others several times as well. This is not the way you can do business. As a summary still very nice business class product, but losing the advantage to competitors.",Promoter

Running through the terminal, I passed QR checkin already with my boarding pass and let them know I had landed. They told me to proceed through security and phoned the gate to let them know to expect me. At the gate I was greeted by cheers from the staff who radioed to confirm that my bag had also made it.

"  Houston to Kuala Lumpur via Doha. Flew Qatar Airways for the first time and was impressed with their product. The overall experience was low stress and helped me manage my anxiety which was incredibly important given that I have a severe fear of flying. Being able to go through the much shorter Business class TSA line, being able to decompress in the lounge prior to boarding and having priority boarding made the lead up to the actual flight a positive one. Onboard the plane, the staff were friendly and service was top notch. Seats were comfortable with plenty of room to stretch out, get up and walk around. Noise cancellation headphones helped drown out the engine and ambient noise which helped my mental state. The PJs and amenity kit were great, providing great comfort and warmth. The overall inflight cabin experience was really great, hats off to really good cabin crews Qatar Airways. Arrival and lay-over at Hamad International Airport was smooth, efficient, and comfortable. I love the Al Mourjan business lounge. Being able to take a shower and decompress from the stress of flying in such a lovely and spacious environment before continuing on my journey was a necessity I didn't realize I needed. Love the shower rooms and the food in either restaurant (there are two in the lounge) was great. Having separate areas was smart and the quiet area is fantastic for catching up on some sleep between flights. Didn't do any shopping at Hamad but they looked like they had quite a lot to offer. The second leg of my journey also went smoothly. Upon arrival being ahead of the main rush was good and my bags were off the belt within the first 10 that arrived. Business class tickets aren't cheap but for the level of service, the quality of the product and the amenities that you get with Qatar Airways, it was money well spent and an experience I will happily pay for again in the future.",Promoter

Flew on the Boeing 787 from Manchester to Doha return, an excellent aircraft, plenty of space, good IFE, Crew on both outward and inward journey excellent, food very good, although did not eat on return journey due to not feeling well (slept for 6hrs). I wish Qatar would do away with the narrow bodied A321 on the Doha to Goa leg of the journey - very cramped, economy passengers putting their luggage in lockers above business and on the return journey a screaming/crying child for the whole flight with only a curtain seperating economy from business - the only reason i am not giving 10 out of 10. Crew on all flights were excellent. Lounge in Doha excellent - the best lounge I have been in, the Escape lounge they use in Manchester just about ok, lounge in Goa, well it's just laughable - 1 drink & then either a burger (on it's own no fries) or a mini cheese and tomato pizza. Will definitely fly Qatar Airways again.",Promoter

Nice business class seat that makes into a nice bed for sleep. The meal served was quite good, but staff service was slow during meal times and forgot wine order twice. IFE with a great choice of films and TV to watch. Transfer in Doha was okay both ways - a slight wait at security screening, and then into lounge. The lounge is visually nice, but the amenities were all overcrowded - couldn't wait for a shower due to the queues and food choice a bit uninspiring. For the price paid, the trip was exceptional value, and apart from some slow staff service, the rest of the product was great. Will use again.",Promoter
"  Heathrow to Doha on a Boeing 777, I thought the legroom and comfort of the seat on this sector was very good, I had plenty of room, the food and beverage was of a high standard, crew were very professional and nice. Before take-off they asked me if I'd flown with Qatar Airways before which I hadn't so they then took the time to explain how the on-board service works, (you can order whatever you want from the menu to be served at any time you like). I got some sleep on the overnight sector to Doha and was impressed by the experience, I wasn't as impressed with the A330 that operates the Doha to Phuket sectors, I'm of average build but I found the seat to be very narrow when in bed mode and couldn't sleep. Food and beverage immaculately presented and of a high standard, entertainment system easy to use and good content. Final sector Doha to Heathrow upper deck on the A380, single seat, configuration 1-2-1 really comfortable seat/bed with plenty of personal storage space. I'm not sure why Qatar Airways bother with the bar at the back of the business class cabin on this aircraft as I only saw one person using it. The lounge at Doha is okay but didn't blow me away as expected from reading various reviews, it was very busy both times I was there and I found it to be quite soulless and uninteresting. Also the dining options were limited, not my favourite airline lounge. Overall though a very solid business class product, I won't hesitate to fly with Qatar Airways again.",Promoter

Dessert was pineapple chunks coated with sugar syrup. I wish had not ordered any special meal. I recommend Qatar airways to be considerate with the choice of meal.

"  The new International Phuket airport should be avoided since the chaotic luggage and immigration checks cause a lot of delays, it took me almost 2 hours to pass check in and immigration. A terrible experience with the A330-200, which Qatar Airways replaced recently for this route. Seat is narrow and cramped and so is the cabin with it's 2x2x2 configuration, crew had no decent space to serve customers without touching others. No storage room in or around the seat, no decent storage place for the provided bottle of water. Food poor. Crew attentive and trying to make the best of things. Real shame Qatar Airways uses this plane on long haul flights. Flight from Doha to Brussels onboard the Dreamliner was such a relief and a wonderful experience again. Seat, dining and service top notch. Truly a 5 star business class product. If they can replace all the A330's on long haul by 787, A350 or A380 then overall would be 10 points.",Passive

"  Manchester to Bangkok via Doha. I can't think of any other airlines that match the standards of Qatar Airways. Excellent check-in facilities at Manchester, Qatar don't have their own lounge here and use the Escape lounge which isn't the best as now they've merged the business class and normal lounge so it's crowded and noisy but very helpful staff. Since I originally booked, Qatar changed the transit time in Doha and the aircraft on both legs of the journey, Manchester to Doha is now a Boeing 787, an improvement on the A330, but Doha to Bangkok is now a Boeing 777 which isn't up to the standard of the A380. However once onboard it's the service that matters not the aircraft, and this is where Qatar excels. The flight attendants are helpful and attentive, the food is probably the best you'll get on a flight, the entertainment is good with a choice of movies to suit most tastes. The 787 is a fine aircraft however I found the seats in business slightly uncomfortable probably due to being 6'5"" as the end of the seat was halfway down the back of my thighs and I needed to recline the seat. The 777 feels old now compared to the 787 and A380, the business cabin seems cramped due to the 2x2x2 layout. All flights arrived early despite one being delayed due to some passengers in economy wanting to pick were they wanted to sit rather than were they were allocated. Ground staff in Bangkok also excellent, Qatar Airways will soon have their own lounge there rather than use the Thai lounge. Any negatives only that I seem to have lost my privilege club silver status, have to check my points. **ASKED TICKET",Promoter
"  Abu Dhabi to Perth return via Doha. Little to be said about connecting flights to / from Abu Dhabi. The Doha to Perth leg was on a Boeing 777-300 in 3x4x3 configuration, the return an aircraft with the old 3x3x3 seating. It would be wrong to suggest the revised seating is terrible. Leg room was ample, certainly far more generous than the equivalent provided by Etihad for example, and the food and IFE were to the usual high standard. Nonetheless, yet more dumbing down of standards / cutting costs to the point where there is increasingly little to differentiate its economy service from other operators. I lost count of the number of times I was bumped by passing traffic on the flight to Perth. I appreciate why Qatar Airways is pursuing this policy but very disappointing nevertheless.",Passive
"  Having previously flown this route on PIA, I was eager to try absolutely any other airline. Having said that, Qatar with its brilliant reputation and reasonable fares made the obvious choice this time around. They didn't disappoint. We flew out on the 777-300ER (when we booked it was supposed to be the 787 but was later changed to this), where the seats were comfortable (reasonable leg room for Economy class), food was to a high standard and the IFE had a huge selection of movies/TV shows to select from. The staff were courteous at all times as well. From Doha to Islamabad it was the A320 which despite being a smaller aircraft had the similar feel to the 777. The IFE was of the same quality, food (although only served once) too was of the similar high standard. All in all, a fantastic experience and more than likely to fly with them again.",Promoter

"  Atlanta to Kuwait via Doha with Qatar Airways. Great value and service. I managed to get the fare for about $3500 which was far cheaper than any of the other options I had leaving ATL and was impressed with the overall experience. There are a couple of very minor things that might have bothered me if I hadn't got such a good deal. The 2x2x2 configuration seems dated nowadays and the service although great was a little annoying as the attendant who serviced my seat kept trying to suggest things rather that waiting for me to make a decision, but really these are minor comments. Given its a 13 hour flight the I was suitably fed, watered and entertained to have keep me happy. Was there anything absolutely outstanding and noteworthy? No, but there also wasn't anything to significantly complain about. Despite my earlier comment about the configuration, the seats were way better than Delta's business one lay flat and although I gave a good review about AF's long haul BC this was better, even though I can't put my finger on why. I am however looking to my return to USA. The first class lounge at Doha is something to behold. More like a ultra discreet luxe hotel restaurant than a lounge and well worth spending a short time in.

Of course it's the cabin feel that is the only thing that is different on the A350.

"  Was very excited to fly on the A350 from Doha to Frankfurt. My first time. Though when I got onboard there really wasn't much of a noticeable difference. I think the Dreamliner already took all the excitement out of this new jet! Spacious cabin. Quiet engines. Impressive entrance. The Dreamliner had first mover advantage. Granted, the engines were very quiet, even at takeoff. Although interior design wise, I found the overhead bins to be very low when open. I whacked my head a few times when getting stuff out. I love the seat on this plane. Very comfortable and private, since you face into the window. One of the best. I have high expectations when flying Qatar for I have had many amazing flights with them. This, unfortunately, was not one of them. The food was so-so (steak was very tough) and I found the IFE on this new A350 very cumbersome to use. I couldn't for the longest time get the touch screen to work. Perhaps it was a single incident. I hope so. I did like the gimmicky 3D map feature on the IFE. It worked similarly to Google maps. You could zoom in/out with your fingers, move the map around thus felt somewhat interactive. The front camera view captivated me for you could actually see the front landing gear during takeoff and landing, which is good at the actual moment of touchdown. I love big windows, however, the windows on this A350 annoyed me. In order to close the shades with the electronic button you had to reach way down between the wall and the panel of your seat. Was very difficult to reach. I was expecting a button on the control panel to close the windows, but alas none. Very badly designed seat/window for the wall paneling of the seat by your head is too high and covers the window buttons. Looking forward to my return flight on the Boeing 787 to see how the two compare.",Passive

"  I flew New York to Doha return on an A350 in Business Class in late October. The plane is quite new, and the business cabin is spacious and airy. There are no overhead bins over center seats, giving the 1-2-1 configured cabin a sense of spaciousness. The seats were truly excellent - spacious, with plenty of nooks and crannies to store things, and with an excellent entertainment system. All of the hardware was truly first rate, which made the less-than-stellar soft-product all the more disappointing. The drawback to the seat configuration is that people travelling together in the center are so far apart that it's hard to converse in a low tone of voice. The food was quite tasty and nicely presented. The cabin attendants did their jobs, and nothing more. The service was polite, perfunctory, and when they finished, they disappeared behind the galley curtains. So much so that some children who got bored started racing around the cabin bumping into seats, waking up their occupants, and then, when they tired of that, they started taking out the life vests and playing with them. It was literally hours before one of the cabin attendants stumbled upon half a dozen life vests strewn on the floor. If there had been an emergency, those vests would have been needed. The cabin attendant merely picked them up and took them with him behind the curtain. The wifi was terrible on both flights. Frequently out of signal, and when there was signal, the speed was atrocious. Barely enough to send and receive emails without attachments. The lavatories were not always maintained to good standard.

In the air, service and comfort was quite good, and the economy class food was quite good. Three of my flights were on the A350 which is the best of the new aircraft, quite spacious in economy - lots of legroom but the width was a bit cramped, despite being wider than the 787. The Boeing 777 was 10-across and horrible, especially in the middle two seats. At least it was only two hours, but it shows that aircraft selection has a big impact on economy comfort. Apart from the 777, which was unfortunately packed, the other flights were quite empty, increasing the comfort levels and meaning that they offered quite reasonable upgrades on every one of my legs. I got it for the last flight and it was what you'd expect from business class. I also couldn't get the wifi to work on any flight. I think they should just give up on that.",Passive
"  Stockholm to Doha with Qatar Airways. SAS ground staff (acting for Qatar) did a wonderful job dealing with my range of economy class issues. Seating changes and baggage weights all sorted out in a flash. The Dreamliner was scrambled full, barely one spare seat in all classes. The service was surprisingly prompt and attentive. I'm a fallen ""ex"" top tier member and they still made me feel welcome. Seating was very tight - I don't recall the streamlined leg room being so limited, All in all a tough gig for Qatar airways - crammed as it was I still felt welcome. Well done on a tough job.",Passive
"  Hanoi to Bangkok with Qatar Airways. The only negative that I can think of for this flight is that it was much too short. Check-in service at the business class counter was immediate, efficient, and friendly. Qatar uses a multi-airline lounge at HAN which offers mediocre food and spirits but spectacular views of the runway and tarmac. There were very few passengers on the HAN-BKK segment, so boarding did not have to be ""organized"" in any fashion. Despite a very quick turnaround, the plane was clean, neat, and well-prepared. The welcome drink included a choice of two different champagnes. I chose the Billecart-Salon, which was excellent. The snack service was quick and tasty, accompanied by another glass of champagne. The seat back TV screens are huge, with a clear and sharp picture. I entertained myself with the sky-map, but if the flight had been longer, there was a huge selection of movies, TV shows, and music. Departure and arrival were punctual, and Qatar provides a pass to allow J class passengers to use an expedited immigration line at BKK. I wish I could have stayed onboard for the next segment to Doha.",Promoter
"Dallas Ft Worth to Delhi via Doha, and this is the business class that spoils you for life. Flying home on another highly-touted carrier a few weeks later was a bit of a letdown after being so pampered on Qatar Airways. Meals when you want them, wonderful pyjamas, comfy beds/seats - didn't even get a chance to walk around as I usually do, because it was just so nice in our little piece of paradise. The shorter leg to DEL featured also excellent service - this was unexpected as the flight was in the middle of the night and so much shorter.",Promoter
"Helsinki to Melbourne via Doha. Inaugural flight from Helsinki, the A350 was amazing. The business class seats looked a lot better than the ones on the Boeing 777-300. (Really wish I had taken up the business class email upgrade offer). The cabin felt great and the entertainment system was excellent with no lag at all with swiping and so on. The camera options were great too. Food was excellent, gin tonic with ice even, wine and cognac and coffee. Downside was the repetitive adverts and the safety video revolving around Barcelona and football which quickly got very annoying. I pre-selected vegetarian meal on both flights but was only served it on the 2nd leg, the normal food being served looked much better to be honest. Hotel stopover was good, hotel could maybe be a little closer to airport and center of Doha. Only complaints from 2nd leg was that mine and neighbouring person had something stuck in the audio jacks so could not use headphones and entertainment system was old and lagging.",Promoter
"  Our return trip from Heathrow to Perth via Doha was amazing. We flew business class and spent some time at the Qatar lounge at Terminal 4 Heathrow. We had lunch there and drinks and lazed away our time til our flight was called. Inflight service for the London/Doha leg was impeccable, excellent staff who literally did all they could to make our trip wonderful - the food was lovely and again was amazed how much room there is in Business Class and the width of the seat. Doha/Perth was fantastic too, we were given complimentary pyjamas and the staff not only made us feel very welcome their service was great. Thanks again Qatar for fantastic flights in both economy and Business Class. Definitely would book this airline again.",Promoter
"  My husband and myself flew for the first time with Qatar in mid August from Perth to London Heathrow return via Doha. Check in was the easiest I have experienced and once on board the plane our seats were really quite roomy and we were made very comfortable. The cabin service was excellent and the food very good. The Entertainment system was easy to use and had a good selection of various films, music, tv shows and games etc. I have flown with other airlines but I think Qatar Airways is far and away the best airline I have flown with.",Promoter
"  Singapore to Kilimanjaro via Doha. Decent in flight service and food. Doha to Kilmanjaro one of our group was bumped, and on return two were bumped.

The seats were comfortable, entertainment on both flights were archaic. The free WiFi is non existent.",Detractor
"  Colombo to Cairo return via Doha return in October 2016. All widebody, newer A330-200 aircrafts. All flights full and on time (one had an ignorable delay), service on ground and on plane top notch. Long stay-overs, long time lounge access, and potential immigration issues were sorted out smoothly by Qatar Airways ground staff. First Class DOH-CAI-DOH is de facto just only business class but in widebody. On the outbound they served only breakfast and no meat-dishes were offered. Likewise no fresh garlic, ginger, chilli nor fish-sauce is available. No ice-cream, mango smoothies (only strawberry). But the extensive drink list and the cabin staff service made it somehow up. On Cairo to Doha it was a more fully fledged menu with excellent options. From Cairo pre-departure champagne was not offered due to local laws. Cost cutting edges has also begun to show in Doha, where they stopped a la carte servings in Al Mourjan lounge. However, in the alternative Al Safwa first class lounge they provide even fully fledged free â€œhotel roomsâ€ inside the lounge. Last leg DOH-CMB was operated by Sri Lankan who also did well (see my other review for the Sri Lankan leg). Qatar Airways takes particularly good care of their elite frequent flyers. They facilitated check in at airside, avoidance of immigration problem, and provided extended time lounge visits. First time I avoided bus drives in Doha airport that gives a much better overall impression.",Promoter
"  Good airline if you book through their website, turn up 4 hours before departure and can get a good seat. Terrible if anything goes wrong. Excellent food, comfortable seats and vaguely attentive staff. The check-in at Manila airport took 90 mins. I flew from Manila to London to visit my Mum, who was in hospital with cancer. My wife and I did not realise that the 00:40 am departure required boarding the previous day. We phoned the airline in panic and they decided to waive their 'no show' policy on compassionate grounds. They quoted me a fee of about $130 to change my departure date and said we did ""not have to pay for a second ticket"". The lady on the phone confirmed that my return flight did not need changing. I agreed to the payment. A few days later our credit card bill showed a huge deduction. It has taken me 2 months of emails to get 2 replies from Qatar Airways. The replies make little sense. It's now apparent that Qatar Airways changed all my flights after I spoke to them on the phone. They moved me to the most expensive Economy fare, changed my seating and charged me a so-called 'price difference'. This was done without my knowledge or permission. So much for their compassion.",Detractor
"Melbourne to Copenhagen via Doha with Qatar Airways. What a surprise to receive a tap on the shoulder and to be asked to follow the flight attendant together with my husband to the back of the plane.

What a special way to start our holiday. Thank you to the staff for their thoughtfulness and what a credit to Qatar Airways.",Passive
"  Doha to Kuala Lumpur, the inbound flight had apparently caused a 6 hour delay to the outbound flight to KL.

"Just flew with Qatar Airways from Perth to Barcelona via Doha, and Barcelona to Singapore via Doha to experience three aircraft types. The daily Boeing 777 service from Perth to Doha is excellent and we prefer to fly the Boeing 777 when we can. We enjoyed the A330-200 service from Doha to Barcelona and return, then had our first crack at the A350 from Doha to Singapore. First thing to say is the service is consistently excellent in Business Class with Qatar, and we would love it if Qantas was aligned with Qatar, which is our airline of choice over Emirates, even though this costs us in terms of status credits and frequent flier points. Qatar is a step ahead of Emirates, but QF frequent fliers are penalised if they choose QR. We were not overly impressed with the A350, especially with no independent air vent (something shared with their 787) and we find it a little warm on our flight. We also had a small problem in our seats in the A350 with the divider being stuck in the up position which meant my wife and I were separated to an extent we would normally not experience. Generally, the Qatar Airways experience is outstanding, including the lounge in Doha, although the restaurant in the business lounge no longer offers an a la carte service which is a disappointment. Overall we'll continue to choose Qatar Airways above Emirates.",Promoter

"  Shanghai to Madrid via Doha. The first leg from Shanghai to Doha was terrible - seats were so cramped with the 3-4-3 seat configuration on the B777 that my knees nearly touched the seat in front of mine and I'm only 5'5, plus I didn't have room to stretch out my legs due to the entertainment system box at my toes. The flight attendants had forgotten that I had requested a vegetarian meal, (fortunately there was a vegetarian option on the regular menu) and they kept waking people up for the meal service even though our flight left Shanghai at midnight. The saving grace was the amenity bag. However, when we boarded our flight to Madrid, it was like two completely different airlines. The Boeing 787 was spacious, and the flight attendants were friendly and the vegetarian options were tasty - the other passengers even asked if they could have what I was having. Our flight back to Shanghai was a marked improvement on the first flight. Even though it was a Boeing 777 again with the 3-4-3 seating, we had a lot more leg room this time around. The service was more in line with what we experienced going to and leaving from Madrid. I would give them a perfect score if it wasn't for that first leg.",Passive
"  Kuala Lumpur to Paris and back via Doha in business class. You may experience some very minor hiccups or confusion on the ground, especially ex-Doha (e.g. I'm not sure why placing the correct luggage tag on my suitcase required a meeting of three ground staff - they never explained what the issue was. I got the impression that European travelers tend to receive colder treatment than others, but that is not exclusive to Doha airport. But once you're in the air, everything is wonderful. The crew treat you like an old friend. The service comes across as not only efficient and courteous but warm, sincere and lighthearted when the occasion calls for it. Well done. I will be back.",Promoter

Staff forgot to hand out amenity pouches or pyjamas for the 7.5 hrs Singapore to Doha and vice versa flights. Main entrÃ©e choice was limited to only 3 choices. Seat was comfy enough but on the B787 it lacked storage. From what I read, seats in the A350 seemed to have more storage. Flights from Singapore to Rome and vice versa were supposed to be the A350 but switched to B787 a few months before departure - really disappointed with this. Business lounge in Doha was great, far better than SQ lounge in Changi Airport. But they did not have the a la carte menu and Krug Champagne on the Mezzanine floor restaurant. A sign of cost cutting measure? The range of Asian movies onboard is also very limited. Worst of all, their flights seemed to depart at odd hours, for example 2.30am from Singapore to Doha and vice versa.",Passive

It's nice to have an international route on a local stretch which sets new standards for the region. Check in took only a minute, very few passengers on this route. Onboard FA's were polite, correct, professional, focused and caring â€“ however, service was limited to approx. 10 minutes of effective service (flight took only 45 Minutes of time), but drinks with options were provided.

"  Flew Mumbai to Atlanta via Doha with Qatar Airways for the first time and had a great experience. I was a little disappointed with a few aspects. The seat was very comfortable with amazing legroom and backrest / headrest. The welcome amenities were quite good and useful. However, the entertainment system technology needs a lot of thought - the right button on one of my co-passenger's screen didn't work which left her with only 4/5 movie options and was very annoying. Even though they have a great selection, the hardware needs an upgrade. The call attendant button or light button did not work on my seat remote control. Also, I had multiple issues with air hostesses both on Mumbai-Doha and Doha-Atlanta leg. Even after the call attendant button was pressed, none of the air-hostesses paid attention and I had to call them while they were passing by in the aisle. I could see 3-4 other attendant lights switched on but nobody came by for 10 minutes or so. The meal timings were really bad. After they served us brunch at 11:30 AM Doha time, no food was served till almost 6 PM. Having reached Doha at 5 AM, just having 1 meal till evening was not what I had in mind. When asked for food, the air hostess said we will be serving sandwiches in some time. The overall experience was okay but had these issues not been there, it would have been amazing.",Passive

"  Los Angeles to Johannesburg with a long layover in Doha. The seats assigned seemed to be entirely random, no effort was made to keep us together, preference for window or aisle were largely ignored. My seat gave average legroom and width. The arms of the seat on the Boeing 777LR only go up about 3/4 of the way making it extremely difficult to get out of the row, especially when the seat in front is reclined. If there are empty seats you can't lie down unless you can fit under the partially extended arms. We had a 15+ hour flight from Doha, we departed about 8am from Doha an average breakfast was served at 9am, we received a bag of chips about 5 hours later.

"Perth to Venice via Doha. Excellent airline. Flights were on time. Food was great. Leg room was adequate. FA's were excellent. My only complaint was, that I had seats booked for over 10 months and then a few weeks before the flight, they changed my seats. I rang them and they said it was probably because of medical reasons, that the people sitting in my seats needed access to the toilets etc. When we got on board, the 4 seats in question were occupied by young men travelling alone? On the way back, one seat was left vacant, totally wasted. So, the moral of the story is, don't bother booking seats. They gave our away seats for some unknown reasons and wouldn't change them back. They even had my husband and I sitting in different parts of the plane when they changed them and didn't notify me. It was only that I went on line to have a look, that I noticed the changes. Luckily, there were still 2 seats together that I could change to but nowhere near where I wanted to sit. Also, the Check in at Venice Marco Polo Airport was chaotic.

"  Brussels to Tokyo Narita via Doha. The check-in was ok smooth, but I wasn't offered any special seats despite my OW Sapphire status.

BA lounge access not up to mid/longhal standards required for the 6 hour flights to DOH. There are no shower facilities and the food choices are limited to a breakfast setup, despite the evening departure. QR boarded their flight one hour ahead of depature time which seems excessive. On top of poor seat width, the pitch seemed too tight, and I'm not a giant. There was a IFE box stealing 20% of my feet area and no footrest. Storage in the seat pocket was poor, I couldn't fit my water bottles. PTV remote was covered in smudges. I had ordered a special meal, low fat, which was pasta. The pasta was dry. The fruit salad showed signs of decay. The salad looked ok but the vinaigrette tasted awful. The bread was not freshly baked. In the bathroom, no amenities were offered in economy. The marking on the flushing button in the bathroom was unreadable. The cabin temperature was cold, but a good fleece blanket offered. I asked the cabin crew to raise the temperature and was answered that the captain would have to decide on that. IFE systems was loaded with advertisement.

Being able to choose when to have your meals is a real bonus and the choices were good. There were a few hitches though. On the Adelaide to Doha leg (A350), my seat would not go all the way into the sleep position - there was a 6 inch gap between the fixed 'foot end' and the seat, and the head end was raised somewhat. Despite this, it was still very comfortable. There was only one movie which was anything close to my taste - more choice is needed for long-haul flights, in this case 13 hours. Qatar Airport was a big let-down. Why they don't have air-bridges is a mystery, especially in such a harsh climate.",Promoter

"  Sydney to Athens via Doha. The inflight experience is what I am paying for in deciding to fly business. The initial minor problems in the Sydney to Doha leg seemed to arise from our seats being in the last row in the business class section. On boarding the flight to Doha we were asked if we would like pyjamas. On replying yes, we were told only XXL was left, which were so big we could not use them. We were then asked to choose dinner. I asked for dinner to be served as soon as the plane had reached its cruising altitude. When dinner was served, approximately 30 minutes after take off, I was told my choice of wine had run out. So, of the 3 white wines available (not a great selection in the first place) the one I had chosen had run out within 30 minutes of take off. Similarly, when dessert was served we were told the one dessert wine available which we had asked for had also run out. The crew member told us only 2 half bottles had been available for the whole of the business class cabin. We complained to the cabin supervisor who apologised and said they had in fact found some dessert wine and brought us a glass. It all just seemed a little poorly organised and executed. These are small points, but this is exactly why I am willing to pay double the cost of an economy ticket for a business class service. It is the small details that make the difference. Without them, I might as well be in economy. The main problem was my seat would not fully extend to flat. The foot rest remained vertical, so it was not possible to lie down. Staff attempted to physically fix it but were unable to do so. The seat had jammed halfway between upright and flat. 3 staff spent approximately 30 minutes under the seat trying to fix it. This was about halfway through the flight, during which time we both had to stand in the aisle while they tried to fix it. The flight was full, so there was nowhere else we could go. So neither of us were able to sleep fully during the flight. On asking how we would be able to land with the seat stuck in this position, the crew suggested I might have to sit in a crew jump seat as there were no other seats available. In the end, they physically pushed the seat back into a semi-upright position that they said was sufficient for landing purposes. But no sleep for me or my partner. The cabin supervisor suggested I write in to complain. More than 6 weeks later I'm still waiting for a response to my initial email.",Detractor

Boeing 787 business class with Qatar Airways is the best I have flown, beats Singapore Airlines, Etihad and Emirates. Very airy cabin, large windows, excellent seat, superb food, friendly and speedy service by the flight attendants with a good choice of drinks. Emirates better only when it comes to the IFE system and in-flight Internet, Singapore Airlines on par for catering, better only when using ""book the cook"" advance meal choice.

"We flew from Manchester to Bangkok via Doha with Qatar Airways, I did find the check in clerk at Manchester Airport quite abrupt when asking for the exit row seats for both flights as I am 6 ft 4 tall. She said let me check and she had to ask her manager but she did not respond until we got our boarding passes and found out we had the exit row to Doha but not from Doha to Bangkok. The first leg of the flight was on the Boeing 787 Dreamliner in economy. This was a fantastic aircraft and it was very quiet, the food and service and entertainment was spot on from Manchester to Doha and we had the exit row which made it easier for me to stretch my legs. We only had a one hour transfer time at Hamad International Airport. The Airport was huge and it was so modern and clean. We boarded the A380 for our flight to Bangkok, this aircraft is huge and I found the economy seats to be very comfortable with large IFE screens to watch the entertainment to pass the time. Again the service and the food was fantastic and we were in Bangkok in no time. Flying back to Manchester via Doha from Bangkok I asked again for the exit rows in Bangkok and if we could sit upstairs in the small economy section on the A380, this was successful but we did not get the exit row on the A380 but it was nice to be sat in the small economy section upstairs.

The first noticeable difference is the ease of navigating their website which is well organised and easy to get to the required services. Check-in at Singapore was quick and completed within 15 mins including the time I started queuing in line to get checked-in. The smooth check-in experience was repeated again in JFK with a knowledgeable staff who was professional, friendly and accommodating. Worth mentioning is Qatar Airway's use of Terminal 7 at JFK. It could be sheer luck but on both occasions at arrival and departure, I did not experience the massive crowds that I had experienced in other JFK terminals. The seats are organised in a 3-3-3 configuration and each seat comes with a large touch screen tv with a separate console for controls. The feel and look of the tv is much sleeker than those of the other 2 carriers I have flown and comes with more varied programming. Another well designed feature is the toilets which come with a decent sized wash basin and a wet tissue dispenser for cleaning the toilet seats. Ample food options were available even though I sat close to the back of the plane. There are no overhead cabins for the last 4 to 5 rows of seats in the middle block but there does not seem to be any problems accommodating everyone's bags. Some of the cabin crew looked rather new on the job but it was clear that they all worked hard to accommodate everyone's requests. Definitely an airline I would consider highly on my next long haul flight.",Promoter
"  Zagreb to Perth via Doha. We have previously flown with Qatar and had a very pleasant experience, However, this particular flight was not as pleasant due to the fact Qatar Airways had introduced the new Boeing 777-300 seats, new configuration plane (3x4x3). We had 3 seats between the 2 of us and thank goodness as I would not have survived with 3 people in the row of 3. The armrest was not big enough for 2 arms, the depth of the seat was considerably smaller. The width was smaller as I could not fit my hand down between the arm rest and myself. Sadly we will not be travelling with Qatar Airways again when going to Europe and will choose to pay slightly more for economy with another airline just to know we will get adequate leg and seat room.",Detractor
"  Kuala Lumpur to Doha. The boarding procedure was easy and unproblematic. The journey was more than 7 hours, the aircraft took off at 8.30am. I was sitting by a window. The aircraft was not full it was an empty seat beside me. Every seat had a pillow, a blanket and a headset. The service was very good: we got a complete lunch (lamb with rice, salad, cookie) and a sandwich one hour before landing. The crew was excellent I can recommend the airline very much.",Promoter
"  I was flying the second time this year with Qatar Airways from Athens to Johannesburg via Doha. Both round trips were, considering the cabin class, very pleasant flights. Flights on time, staff friendly, service and meals onboard without any complaint. Very positive was the generous leg room and the comfortable seat on all used planes (777, 787, 330). The on board entertainment has a huge selection of movies and worked perfectly. The only thing I found annoying on my trip in June, was the very strict application of the baggage weight limits and the hefty fee that QR charged per extra kg. However, based on this and earlier experience, I would choose this airline again for my business trips.",Promoter
"Kuala Lumpur - Doha - Berlin TXL on Sun 31st July (B777-300ER and A330). QR flight to KUL had arrived ahead of schedule and was looking forward to an on time departure. After sitting on the plane for over 1 hr already, were absolutely amazed by the Qatar policy to let people board the plane still 50 minutes after departure time (9.45 am and 10.35), people were simply late and kept other passengers waiting on this Sunday morning - very good weather and no traffic problems in KUL. Why on earth do they start boarding the aircraft before 9 am when they let people board until 10.35 way behind the schedule? Having known this, we would have slept 1Â½ hrs longer as well. Take off 11.16 am leaving many passengers worried about their onward connections. Unfortunately, this flight was worse in several areas than the usual quality experience on QR: delayed boarding that was simply unacceptable, tight seating 3-4-3 with good 33"" seat pitch though, mediocre food and small portions and the general feeling of being cramped on board. The mid-flight snacks could be healthier as well: always white bread which is far too sweet, very sweet cakes or crisps - 6/10 only. DOH - TXL on A333 the same Sunday afternoon was another story: excellent boarding with on-time departure from DOH, pleasant and highly motivated cabin crew, three options for lunch (beef-chicken-vegetarian), water and juices served three-four times during the flight and an early arrival at TXL. The meal service was exemplary with two + two carts in economy plus one hostess serving the last five-six rows from the rear galley, which seemed fast & efficient. The IFE with smaller screens on this 11-year old Airbus was not as good as on their newer planes, however, this flight was excllent compared to our first leg on QR the same morning and deserves 9/10.",Promoter
"  I traveled in a group with Qatar Airways from Brussels via Copenhagen and Doha to Dar Es Salaam. Unfortunately, the boarding of on this flight was denied in Doha due to payload problems (July 9th 2016). Since the next flight was 24hr later, we were offered by Qatar airways and compensation of 250USD. To claim the 250 USD we had to go Dar Es Salaam to the Qatar office. Unfortunately, there was no office at the airport for arriving passengers. We couldn't go to the departure hall since we had no valid ticket to leave Dar Es Salaam. In Zanzibar airport, the office was closed. Back in Qatar, they said at the transit office that we should go to Brussels and claim it there, and Brussels they told us that we should have claimed the money in Doha. Although the flights were great, services in the airports a real mess.",Passive
"  Seoul Incheon to Venice via Doha. Generous seat pitch in economy class with fair reclining space, especially in Boeing 777. Provide small amenity kit for overnight flight, which is a plus. Love the food served, at least edible and hot compared to Emirates. Price is very affordable if you plan your trip early, value is good. FA is very caring to customer's need, a FA had realized a passenger had red eyes when serving meals, and she quickly provided eye drops. What I want to praise is she noticed passenger's need even without being told! Overall a 5-star airline with competitive price and service!",Promoter

On arrival to Doha a proactive ground crew approached us to make some remedy for the flight that we had missed. He said that our flight is rebooked for the next day and they will send us in a hotel. The hotel was more than enough to my expectation and meal allowance is included. The staff of the hotel are also welcoming and hospitable, and I also had the chance to meat my friend who is working in the Bank in Doha. He serve as my tour guide when we walk around the city. Thank you Qatar Airways for making my Doha journey a memorable one.",Promoter
"  Beirut to Bangkok via Doha on Qatar Airways. Second time for this trip route and standards were better when compared to last year. Planes were clean and comfortable economy seats, staff service was efficient if not that personal. Meals about the same as last time, maybe a little smaller? The IFE was great, switched on from boarding until we left the plane, and a great variety to choose from - not very different to my last experience on Emirates when flying them to Jo'burg. All in all, a good trip and excellent value - and liked the new airport in Doha, a great improvement on last year.",Promoter

"  I have flown Qatar Airways on several occasions, and in my opinion, it is a safe bet. Flew from Barcelona to Bangkok via Doha. Aircrafts are fairly new and well maintended, and in general, all crew members are efficient. I have to say I really like this sense of multiculturalism there is on board. I normally fly Qatar for long haul flights, and the ammenities provided are kinda nice, especially for red-eye flights (eye mask, toothpaste and toothbrush, etc). I don't really need it, as I like sleeping while flying or read my own books, but the inflight entertainment system has lots of options, too. The last two times I used Qatar I had the same thought about food, maybe it's all about my own expectations, but it could be better. It just feels average if you compare it with others. Last time snacks were not that good and not really varied (it was also because due to time difference I had breakfast x 2, snaks x2 - felt very repetitive). I was unlucky to sit in the middle of the cabin, so once the crew served us, out of the 3 options available, only 1 was left. Even if Qatar is usually not the most affordable, I wouldn't doubt to fly with them again.",Promoter
"  After an outbound trip which was good, we had slight issue during the inbound trip. First off, start with the check in process at MUC. Arriving 3 hours before flight, it took us 1.5 hours to get the boarding pass. 30-40 people waiting in the line, and only 1 counter is available to do the check in. We and other people ending up boarding last on the plane. Upon arrival for transit at DOH, we were greeted with the sign that passengers to KUL please report to staff. We learned, from the first staff that our flight was overbooked by 50 people. For pax from Munich, they decided to bump us to the next flight. They offered us $250 voucher (not cash) and get on the next plane which will arrive 8 hours later. As that means we will miss the connecting flight and they do not offer to compensate for that connecting flight, we refused the offer. Also, how come it impacted us when we checked in successfully not even 6 hours before. There were several group of passengers. Then the story change, it is not overbooked but technical difficulties. After heated arguments with the ground staff, we indeed can get into the plane, the seat next to me at the plane is empty. It is not until we arrived at KUL that I learned the previous flight for DOH-KUL was cancelled.",Passive
"  Qatar Airways Business Class on A380-800 is my favourite because of its good value. For the price you paid, you get personable service from the cabin crews as well as access to the world's best onboard bar/lounge. Cabin feels intimate as capacity is capped at 48 people. There is no luggage overhead in the middle section of the cabin, so the class feels very roomy/spacious. The only complain that I have is the rather horrible Wi-Fi connection, which is very slow and capped at 15 minutes for business class passengers. Other than that, everything is quite perfect.",Promoter

If you fly Business Class with Qatar Airways on the same aircraft, you may get a Special Services Bus waiting for you when arriving in Doha, but only if the aircraft doesn't park on the terminal.",Promoter
"Bangkok to Edinburgh via Doha. Qatar Airways do not dissapoint. For the price it is one of the best airlines that you can fly in Economy Class. The 777-300ER and 787 planes are modern and keep the noise levels low. Was slightly dissapointed by the fact that in 777-300ER Qatar Airways followed other airlines and switched from 3-3-3 layout to 3-4-3 layout obviously reducing the space and cutting the Economy class seat. However, it was not as bad as I thought it would be, the seats are modern with thinner padding but still comfortable. The IFE needs some improvement in the overall GUI and film choice. The food quality deteriorated over the last 3 years that I have flown with them. Portion's seem to be smaller and the food not as good as before. Overall, for the price we paid for return flights and when comparing the overall experience with European carriers I will not hesitate to choose Qatar again.",Promoter

I am not a large person but when the person in front of me put the seat down 5 minutes after take off, I had no room at all. This leg room was the same on all three flights. On two of these flights I had a tall person sitting behind me and therefore I could not put my seat down and I felt very squashed and unable to watch TV as it was too close to the face. I always pre-order a vegetarian meal and I was pleasantly surprised that I received a different meal on all 3 flights and all 3 were very tasty. As this flight was part of our holiday, I did not have a choice of an airline but if I did, I would not choose to fly them in Economy again.",Detractor
  Flew from Doha to London Heathrow. Qatar Airways Business Class on the A380 is one of the best I have been on. The seat is spacious with plenty of storage. The menu had a very good choice of main meals and also something vegetarian. The bar at the back of Business Class has an airy feel to it. I travelled with my husband and we decided to have the two seats in the middle. He is a terrible traveller but he managed to sleep for 5 hours and felt very refreshed when we got to London. We had a 4-hour layover in Doha and their Business Class lounge is also very good which makes the long flight with stopover much more pleasurable.,Promoter
"  We went back to Qatar Airways after a disappointing flight with Emirates recently and were very happy that we did. Whereas Emirates appear to cut corners in business class, Qatar get this all right. The business lounge at Heathrow is exceptional, great staff, facilities and a superb restaurant with waiter-served gourmet food on offer and a good wine/drinks selection. Boarding was quick and close by. The seats on Q002 to Doha and then onto Denpasar, are 2/2/2 config. If you are not a couple, choose a centre seat, or your window 'partner' will have to climb over you for a toilet visit. The centre seats both have direct aisle access. Seats are not super-wide, but are comfortable and recline fully. The one idea Qatar could take from Emirates is the extra padded seat-base provided, just to make lying down a bit softer if you want to properly sleep. TV screens are big, like Emirates, but unlike Emirates, are high quality/pixelated, so no grainy movies on a huge screen which hurt your eyes. Large choice of movies, mini-series, etc. Qatar staff are tremendous, quite the most eager to please off all airlines I've flown in a long time. Food selection is excellent and served as though in a restaurant, heated and then decanted onto china plates, arranged gourmet style with perfectly heated, fresh bread. Onboard Wifi on both airlines is quite useless but that's a developing technology. The transfer in DOH (to the DPS flight), was a very long walk (15 minutes) but no buses at least and we used the time to stretch our legs. Overall, we'd certainly choose Qatar over Emirates again, even if the fares (which vary considerably) are more expensive to fly with Qatar. We've also seen dates where Qatar is considerably cheaper than Emirates. To sum up, flying with Qatar still feels like 'real' business class.",Promoter
"  We have had 2 flights from Sao Paulo to Perth. The first and the longest one, which should be the best experience, was average: Seats were not that comfortable. Besides old-style seats and lack of privacy, I realized that there was a hole (on the back of the seat) when sleeping on my seat 2A. Flight attendants could be more responsive when we pressed the button as well as when we got changed into the pyjamas. They could set up our bed more promptly. Food was very tasty. Poor wine list.",Passive
"Had a 6Â½ hr delay leaving Doha, but the Qatar Airways onboard experience with their quality foods and beverages by excellent cabin crew made the flight pleasant. However, this flight was terrorized by a 2-year-old toddler who screamed and cried and shouted nonstop without any attempts from her parents to comfort her nor trying to keep her volumes down. This was an insult to other passengers in Business Class and felt like being at a busy McDonalds for 7Â½ hrs. May we suggest Qatar Airways to introduce quiet zones on your aircraft for people who want to relax and enjoy a quality experience in peace and quiet? This has happened several times over the years and, unfortunately, on QR as well: some families are simply unable to make the distinction between their homes and public places nor seem to have the capacity to think about others who would like to enjoy their flights - or just take a rest. I don't fly to make friends but I always respect the privacy of my fellow travellers without putting them into such noisy, ugly nor ill-tempered torture, which was the case on QR852 from DOH to KUL this time. QR is a quality airline and I hope they find innovative solutions to this problem in the long run.",Promoter
"  Flew Qatar Airways from Abu Dhabi to London Heathrow via Doha. Usual high quality product but far from 10/10 perfection, notably departure and arrival into Abu Dhabi. Good points: pristine aircraft and crew, inflight entertainment, excellent timekeeping. As a Silver Privilege card holder I benefit from accessing the upper-deck 'snug' on the A380 at no extra cost. This is at least equivalent to the inflated-price Premium Economy provided by European airlines - excellent. Particularly impressed with Heathrow. On arrival, immigration cleared and bags collected in less than 15 minutes even for a Chinese passport holder. On departure from T4, no queue at check-in - although other airlines appeared to have issues - with ample seating, excellent wifi and refreshment options at High Street prices in the departure lounge, Â£1 for a Boots' sandwich, a steal. Gripes: in common with other middle east airlines, the continued use of buses at Doha that dump connecting passengers at furthest distance from the departure terminal - minimum 20 minute walk - albeit, for both legs, without a requirement to pass through further security checks(?), continual promotion of complimentary wifi on the aircraft that seldom actually worked and, in any event, is only 'complimentary' for a maximum of 10 minutes during the flight. The inadequacies of AUH are well documented elsewhere. Suffice, with Qatar departures at 0555 and 0645 - the former a B777/A332 - check-in was chaotic with woefully inadequate provision of desks and organization of queues which, fortunately, on this occasion, did not delay departure. This is a daily event so no excuses. On return to AUH, after the interminable taxi to the far end of the airport, thereafter a 30 minute wait for ground services to provide stairs to the obligatory bus and an hour to clear immigration, Accepted airport travails are largely outside the control of the airline. Nonetheless, Qatar surely has the wasta to secure improvement, especially at Doha? AUH may be a lost cause, however. I would lose no sleep were Qatar to switch additional resources to DWC and offer an express coach from Abu Dhabi centres in lieu of serving AUH. Indeed, were the policy pursued I would likely benefit from additional sleep.",Promoter
"  I travelled twice with Qatar Airways on the routing HAN-CPH return â€“ totally 12 sectors from CPH to HAN via DOH and BKK and the same on return. 8 of these were on business, the other 4 on economy. 3 different aircraft all of high quality and maintenance standards: B787, A380, and B777-300. Check-in was handled kindly and smart in CPH, despite I was a bit demanding: I needed to coordinate three check-in's as I travelled with family members in economy class. Lounge access granted perfectly, even to family. Luggage handled perfectly and arrived on time. All flights on time. This airline is a solid winner and continues to never disappoint me as the product is very predictable. All departures were on time, earlier, or slightly delayed (in two cases). FA onboard in general are among the very best, quickest, devoted, and most kind that I have experienced. For all 8 business class legs predeparture drinks (inc. champagne) was generously offered. This was for CPH, the first time I experienced that pre-departure champagne was being offered in business class. Food and wines were good throughout but food is getting less, lesser options, smaller portions, often only one meat choice. I was given amenity kits on all longhaul sectors and pyjamas on night-flights. The bar in A380 worked well though I'd prefer chairs to sofas â€“ and missed some music or a bit of life. The best lounges were in Doha, but also the ones in Bangkok were good. The third party lounge used in CPH Airport, â€œAspireâ€, disappoints in comparison with those offered in DOH, BKK, and HAN. The biggest faults are the never-ending bus-rides in Doha (at least one bus trip per stopover for me in Doha. Ramadan caused that lounges in Doha were alcohol dry. Onboard long haul flights, I am annoyed by intrusive, repetitive announcements of QR charity support encouragements.",Promoter

"  Frankfurt to Dubai via Doha. Qatar Airways really is in a class of its own when flying Business Class. Aircraft brand-new, seating outstanding (777 in 2-2-2 layout - only weak point is no Wifi), staff naturally friendly, meal service on demand whenever you want it and tasty food. As this might not be enough, you get, as they call the premium class between DOH and DWC ""First Class"", access to the incredible Al Safwa First Lounge in Doha, where you find absolute silence and all the rest you dream of being used to overcrowded european Business Lounges. In Frankfurt, Qatar uses the Air Canada Star Gold Lounge, which is not at all bad, but nothing compared to Doha. Flying to Dubai via DWC was a great decision. This airport is really small, so the distance to walk from the aircraft to the car-parking (free and empty) is about 200m and takes, queue-less immigration and baggage claim inclusive, some 20 minutes. The short 40 min flight DOH-DWC was operated by Al Maha Airways. You get real Business Class recliner seats, pre-departure drink, arabic coffee and a warm tasty meal. For me, Qatar Airways is the better way to fly - for not even 2100â‚¬ return. Bye, bye, european carriers.",Promoter

Our first flight was delayed an hour in LHR, we were quite concerned we would miss our connecting flight only one hour in Doha. Spoke to two cabin crews, they said there was not much they could do. After landing in Doha, there was no boarding gate so it took a while to reach the departure hall by bus, there is an information counter outside where we came in, however staff weren't being helpful apart from telling us we needed to be fast. The ground staff knew there were about 50 passengers on our flight that were late for their connecting flight, without any help on the ground, me and my husband along with 50 passengers had to run from gate D2 to B3, this was 3 kilometers in distance.

"  Colombo to New York via Doha return with Qatar Airways. In short, this was a memorable experience and the service we received in business class was outstanding. Check in Colombo was smooth although the Araliya lounge did not do justice to Qatar Airways service. A340 between Colombo and Doha had angled, lie-flat seats in 2-2-2 configuration. Service was exceptional except the staff initially forgot to serve my wife the meal she requested. The menu offered all day dining with a good selection of food and wine. Although the transfer ticket pouch states to show this on arrival in Doha there was no ground staff to welcome transit passengers. We had to find our way to the Business Class Lounge, which was not far from the gate. The lounge is an experience in itself, like a mini hotel, with two restaurants, drink stations, two buffets, serviced bars, sleep stations with lie flat couches, toilets with attendants, showers, etc. The lounge was inviting but no announcements are made. We were the last go through security but had no issues. We were looking forward to the A350 and to experience this new aircraft. A350 business class seats are in a 1-2-1 configuration with direct aisle access. We had chosen two middle seats to be close to each other. But they were still reasonably apart to provide adequate privacy with a slide-out screen in between the seats. Cabin staff were very welcoming. The amenity kit for this flight really was exceptional with Armani products, noise cancelling headphones and pyjamas. The cabin staff on this flight was exceptional and made you feel valued. The a la carte menu had a wide range of options to choose from any time you like and was complimented by an extensive selection of wines and spirits. The senior flight attendant was helpful setting up my phone for the on-board wi-fi. Equally the flight attendant who was looking after my wife went to the extent of preparing a special vegetarian meal, when she found that what was on the menu did not suit my wife. On arrival in NY, each one came to say goodbye to the passengers which I thought was very graceful. The return flight from NY to Doha was on a B777-200LR, which had lie flat seats in a 2-2-2 configuration. The seats were not as new as the A350 but nevertheless were comfortable and managed to get good few hours of sleep ahead of the day out in Doha. There was no wi-fi on this aircraft. The service was good, but having experienced the service on A350, I felt bit disappointed. On the return we enjoyed the Qatar Airways complimentary city tour and had more time to spend in the Business Class Lounge. We had breakfast and lunch in the restaurant. The food didn't taste as exceptional as on board. However, there was a good selection in the menu as well as in the buffet.

"Flights with high expectations, considering good reviews. From Sydney staff seemed like they were enjoying their job and had a genuinely nice attitude, which was only slighly ameliorated by tiredness of serving 14 hours fully loaded flight. Food of good quality but in minuscule amounts, limited choice of spirits. Seats were of a nice modern design, generally comfortable, however did not leave much room for shoulders so sitting next to someone of a larger build meant some bodily contact. Layout 3-4-3 did not help much. Also legroom spoke of BA standards (Which is not a compliment). Entertainment had a good amount of options to choose from, but clearly less than Emirates. Not that intutive in use. Flight to Warsaw had paradoxally more a relaxing feeling, better seats, more classic in shape, but no alcohol offered, possibly thanks to Ramadan. Entertainment less extensive, but perfectly adequate. Staff polite and helpful. Overall - Good flights? Absolutely,however for similar money I would rather opt for Emirates in future.

"  When boarding I realized the plane was changed without being notified at check-in. Instead of single window seat on an A350 I got a neighbor next to me on an old B777. After take-off the massage function went on and could not be switched off. The apologetic cabin crew director tried to help, rebooted the system several times but could not fix the problem. As there was no other seat available, I had to stay in my allocated seat and I ended up sitting upright, where the impact of the massage was a bit less then in any other position.

In this case, either a supper or breakfast (as flight departs 1:20am) and serving time is at your choice. You pre-order your choice. Pyjamas and Armani overnight kit are provided.

This for an international traveler transiting through an airport is a big thumbs down for me as I like a glass of wine with my meal. This in future will cause me to chose another airline during this time of year. The second leg was on a Qatar A380. Again excellent service although with 50 plus business class seats the boarding was a bit like economy with a posh seat. Takes a long time to give the personal service I like when boarding. IE welcome drink, towel, pjs and menus etc. The cabin services manager must have seen me frowning and I got everything pretty sharpish after that. The in flight entertainment on this leg kept locking and needed resetting. Also people using their own headsets had damaged the headset jack that resulted in loss of quality of sound in my seat. The food was superb again. I enjoyed being able to walk around and use the the stand up bar and lounge area at the back of the business class section. This is very nice and it stops people gathering in the galley area to get drinks and chat. Qatar always provides me with outstanding service and I love flying only with them if where I am going is one of their routes. Well done to all the staff who took care of me on this flight. Hats off to you!!",Promoter
"Manchester to Islamabad via Doha with Qatar Airways. A very pleasant flight Manchester to Doha - excellent cabin crew service. Due to light load plenty of rows were empty and pax were able to lie flat if they so wished. A7-BAX was a new aircraft and the new type of seats were found to be much more comfortable than the earlier ones. Flight departure was on schedule and arrived early which gave us a comfortable time-gap to transfer to another flight. For lunch there were 3 options and the ones we ordered were very palatable, snacks were readily available throughout the flight. The transfer service at Doha airport was exceptionally good - we had requested wheel chairs and were provided electric 'buggies' from one end of the terminal [B] to end of terminal C and so onto terminal D as well as being escorted onto the bus and up to the aircraft door - we experienced no hassle at all and would like to thank Qatar Airways ground staff and Doha airport. The flight from Doha to Islamabad was operated by an A320 A7-ADG a mid-aged aircraft, however the cabin was well maintained and the washrooms were clean - we found this surprising as our experience on this sector has been somewhat different on other airlines. The service by the cabin crew lived upto the 5* image, however we felt a major shortfall in the dinner offered - only one option of poor quality rice and a spicy curry. The absence of a modern IFE, not even a map display was available, led to tedium. Flight crews on both sectors provided a very smooth flight.",Promoter
"  The Qatar Airways gate security personnel at Doha airport asked some passengers including me to ""empty the contents of your briefcase and carry-on, in as many bins as needed"". For me it took 3 bins, with all the items sitting in the bins for all to see as they rolled along the conveyor belt and reappeared at the other end of the scanning machine while I walked through the people-scanner. When I tried to retrieve my 3 bins at the other end of the conveyor belt, they were not contiguous, and the first was widely separated from the last, with other people's bins in between (I remember seeing other people's dirty laundry, family pictures, a jewelry box, and wad of cash). It was not trivial to re-pack the 3 bin contents into the bags - at the hotel it had taken me half an hour, but I managed to do it in 10 minutes, still too long for the impatient security staff. I heard some of my companions in misfortune use words like never again and this is the last time.",Detractor
"  Early evening Qatar Airways flight from Zurich to Doha. Check-in at the announced check-in opening time (3 hours before schedulded departure). Lots of passengers already waiting in line. Only three check-in agents on duty. Schedulded departure time was 18.30 hours, 18.25 hours take-off. Flight was not full - I had a bulkhead seat just behind Business-Class. Friendly welcome by the mostly Thai crew onboard. Seat was comfortable, screen and earphone quality outstanding and the entertainment selection classy which means a lot of arthouse movies and first rate recordings of operas and classical music available. Toilets were clean and roomy - impressed by the mood-lighting. Instead of the usual cold white lighting: warm and red colours which even made the ""necessary"" a pleasant and entertaining experience. Only disappointment was the food: quality, presentation and quantity were nothing to write home about. I had salad and apple-pie dessert but left the main course untouched. There is room for improvement. However on the plus-side drinks-rounds were frequent. Captain announced an early landing at Doha but due to heavy traffic we just got off the plane at the scheduled arrival time. If it were not for the disappointing food and the lack of staff at check-in I would have rated this trip with 10 stars.",Promoter
"  I used to regard Qatar Airways as one of the very best airlines in the world. This was based mostly on my journey taken in 2014 from Warsaw to Hanoi via Doha. I was impressed by the quality and standards QA presented then. This is why this year (after traveling with Emirates in 2015) I decided to fly with Qatar Airways to Sri Lanka from Warsaw. Unfortunately this time I was left disappointed. 1) Changing an aircraft - choosing QA I was tempted with advertisements of a brand new Boeing 787 Dreamliner. I chose the connection offering this very plane, but a few months later it was changed for one of the oldest machines used by QA - Airbus 340. 2) On board service - in 2014 every passenger was given a travel set (earplugs, toothbrush etc), during my last flight (which was overnight) no such thing was available. 3) Meals - in 2014 there were two meals served (main dish and a snack) now it's only one. 4) No snacks were available during my QR664 flight (unlike in 2014) 5) Drinks - QR boast about being the one air company offering champagne in economy class. No such thing was available, neither on my first flight from Warsaw to Doha this year, nor during flight from Doha to Colombo. These are not very big problems, but they have left me thinking it was only two years, so many changes and all of them for the worse.",Detractor
"I recently flew Qatar Airways from Dallas Ft Worth to Cape Town via Doha, and returning from Cape Town to London via Doha. Crew was professional, however inconsistent - some happy and some basically stoic. Dallas to Doha was mixed - excellent food, amenities and seats/beds. Service felt a bit robotic. Doha to Cape Town also mixed - food, seat/beds, amenities were great, and the service was partially good, yet some didn't appear happy. Entertainment system did not work for part of the flight, and selections were limited. Doha Airport business lounge is on point",Promoter
"  Los Angeles to Doha in Qatar Airways Business class. Check in was uneventful at LAX's Terminal 2 and the Maple Leaf Lounge was very run of the mill. The 16hr ultra-long-haul flight was superb from embarkation to curbside. Qatar Airways shines with the onboard service, meals and wine. Food quality was outstanding and it was great to dine on demand on this super long flight â€“ I ate three times. Service is top notch being professional, prompt and always accommodating. The seats are large and super comfortable, with mattress, soft pillow and blanket. Only downside was I had a window seat so I did have to jump over the legs of fellow seat mate. To me a small price to pay for such a huge bed. Arriving into Doha was seamless with separate customs and immigration that looked more like a lounge than a normal customs area. This trip was definitely 5 stars â€“ the return flight was completely different.",Promoter
"  Doha to Los Angeles in Business class. The onboard meals and service was top notch, seat comfortable and great entertainment choices. A 5.30am check-in took over 30mins then once at the lounge, and seated in the restaurant the waiter balked at me for asking for a menu. Basically, told me I can just have two eggs. So I left and headed to the gate. The gate was a free for all including premium customers and was incredibility hot. The agent loudly and aggressively quizzed about my documentation. Customer service at an all-time low. Airborne everything was going wonderfully well until 3 hours into the flight and the meal service had ended. The couple behind me refused to close their windows (Business has 3 per seat) the entire flight, flooding the cabin with light on this 17hr ultra-long-haul flight. After three conversations with the flight attendants they finally managed to get this couple to close their windows four hours out of LA for an hour. As I am light sleeper it meant I didn't sleep the entire trip. I would fly them again but just hope this experience doesn't happen again.",Passive
"  I was flying from Manchester to Hanoi with just a 55 minute connection in Doha so when they announced there was going to be a 2 hour delay taking off (from Manchester), I realised I would miss my onward flight. Other passengers were not happy to the point that 2 coppers arrived and led a passenger away (just a quiet word did the trick). In the end it was nearly 3 hours late taking off although at least 1 passenger decided not to fly which I think added to the delay as they had to offload her bags. Once in the air, I was pleased I had chosen Qatar Airways as without doubt their economy seat is the most comfortable I have ever travelled in. I think some airlines have the 777-EW as 3-5-3 where as Qatar have gone with 3-4-3 so are less narrow plus these seats also have good lumbar support. Less impressive were the food offerings, I had opted for a vegetarian dish which was very spicy but the FA on seeing that I had not really touched my main, was quick to offer an alternative. I hadn't actually said a word of complaint which amazed me as my usual experience with FAs when travelling economy is that they barely register you exist. On arriving in Doha at around 4am, I was pleasantly surprised how efficient Qatar's ground staff were as they had already booked me a hotel room and issued a new boarding pass. Had to go through immigration which was painless then off to Movenpick Towers and Suites with a 250 Rials credit (about Â£50) to be used for food. I also had my suitcase sent to the hotel which arrived within 2 hours. This was enough for 2 good meals using room service but was told I could not use the restaurant. (Qatar passengers are banned from using the restaurant on Fridays). Also slightly annoying was that the hotel gave the 250 credit in 3 vouchers (100+75+75) so if I wanted to place a food order for 110, I was told I would have to use 2x75 and not receive a voucher for unused 40 Rials. Anyhow bus picked me up at midnight, took me back to airport and checked in for my Hanoi flight. Think it was a different aircraft as economy was 3x3x3 but seats looked identical and just as comfortable. Flight seemed to go quickly including around 60 minutes stop in BKK. Food offerings were even worse than the Manchester-Doha leg but wasn't too bothered as wasn't really hungry anyhow. Hanoi arrival was very smooth into what looks like a brand new terminal. At the price I paid for my ticket, I will definitely fly with Qatar again and if flying from Manchester, eat at the pub on the perimeter road before checking in.",Promoter
"  Exceptional service by cabin crew on all 4 legs with Qatar Airways flying from Bangkok to Manchester via Doha. Aircraft all had the latest products and were very comfortable but on the ground Qatar is terrible: their new airport at Doha doesn't have enough toilets nor showers. My advice is to use the toilets on board before you deplane. In Manchester at the ""Escape"" lounge for business class customers I had to pay for a snack - GBP 6.95 for a hamburger, I could have had a some ""chips"" at GBP 2.00.",Passive
"  I flew from Stockholm Arlanda to Singapore Changi via Doha, in economy class. The first flight was nothing less than expected from Qatar Airways. The inflight service was very good, seats were OK, staff were quite courteous. The flight departed on time and landed a few minutes before schedule. The inflight entertainment in this particular aircraft was a bit dated, but worked nonetheless. Transfer in Doha was quick, no queuing in the security check. The A350-900 was a bit more comfortable than the B787, and the inflight entertainment was newer in this aircraft. WiFi was not free, and the price was very high, which is a big minus. The tickets were very cheap, and I'd say you get a lot for your money. Overall, I'm very satisfied.",Promoter

The seat was worn and the bed was one of the most uncomfortable experiences . The personal light, remote control and cabin crew call button did not work. Luckily this worked on the the empty seat next to mine. The crew was apologizing, but even several tries to reboot the system did not help. So I moved to the other seat. The food service had difficulties to cope with me sitting in another seat : now I was in a seat being served by the other crew. Food was poor as well. The Miso soup was lukewarm without taste and the lamb was overcooked. All in all a very disappointing experience.

"  Flew Qatar Airways from Muscat to Kochi via Doha. The service provided in Business Class was top notch. Dining at the Business Class lounge at Hamad International was excellent.

So I took a tour around inside the new airport. I reported to Gate 8 one hour before my connecting flight to Kochi and noticed that the flight to Kochi will be full. I will give a thumbs down for their service from Doha to Kochi. A330-300 was old but clean, amenity kit provided in the Business Class was really nothing on this short 4hr 25mins flight. Crew were rushing which caused spilling two glasses of Orange Juice on a lady who was sitting next to me. Seat comfort and IFE were good. Looking forward for my return flight in June 2016.",Passive
"  Doha to Shanghai with Qatar Airways. Boarded just after 2am for a 2:50am departure. I planned to go right to sleep and asked a FA to make up my bed just after boarding. I was informed that there are no 'mattresses' and quilts on this flight as it is under 8 hours duration. The FA told me it is a flight duration of 7h50m. The QR website and my electronic itinerary, sent to me by QR, shows the flight as 8h30m. For a flight that leaves DOH at nearly 3am, one would expect that in a business class that has lie-flat seats that QR would have proper bedding, same as on all flights to/from the US, Australia, S. Africa, etc. The FA working my side of the aircraft in the second cabin of business class was cold and generally unfriendly - unusual for QR where the FAs are usually very personable and obliging. She more or less tossed everything at me and had a hard time cracking a smile before marching back to the galley. If you fly in business class with QR to China, bring your own bedding!",Passive
"  Doha to Ho CHi Minh City with Qatar Airways. Check-in at the new Doha airport in the business class area was a delight. Met by Qatar Airways staff at my taxi, and they unloaded my luggage and escorted me to a check in desk. Check in, dedicated security and passport check was very speedy. Once in the departure lounge, I did have a little trouble finding the Al Mourjan business lounge. It's up an escalator, just to the left of the big yellow teddy bear. Superb lounge. Flight departed on time from Gates D - please be aware that the D gates are a long walk from the lounge - the terminal shuttle train is not yet running. Aircraft configured 2-2-2 and we took 2 together by the window and aisle. The seats are fully lie flat, but the foot space is a little small. The seats in row one seemed to have a larger foot rest area. The inflight entertainment had a lot less choice than on the Boeing 787. No wifi on this plane. The dining experience was the same as on my previous report from Manchester to Doha but the menu was different. As the flight departed at 2.30am, we chose a light meal and then had something more substantial near the end of the flight. On demand dining allowed you to chose what you want and when you have it.

"  Manchester to Doha with Qatar Airways. 9am departure - boarding was at 8.15am and the flight left early. Seated in centre seats in a 1-2-1 arrangement. Cabin crew introduced themselves and brought champagne before take off. This flight has a dine on demand service. The crew took my order for lunch and drinks prior to take off. They asked when I wanted it - I said probably later as we had just had breakfast at the airport. They asked me to give them a 15 minute notice on when I wanted the food. Champagne and nuts served after take off. Lunch was soup, followed by an arabic meze. Main course was a spicy chicken dish and finally some ice cream. I declined the cheese course. Great choice of wines, Seating extremely comfortable and versatile. I managed some good quality sleep in the recline mode. The better cabin air atmosphere on the 787 was noticeable. Good selection of inflight entertainment although it took a little while to get used to the remote handset. Interactive flight display but no tail or belly cam. I used the wifi which was seemed to be free for only 15 minutes - easy to log on - and I managed to zap out a couple of emails. On time arrival. The crew allowed all the business class passengers to leave the plane first. Priority lanes at Doha directed us to an arrival lounge where we stopped for comfort break (you could also get refreshments here) then visa on arrival and immigration were at the exit from this lounge.

  We booked a business class flight from Pisa to Auckland via Doha with Qatar Airways for 1 Feb 2017. They have cancelled the flight without even informing us. I only found out when I downloaded their iphone app they have rebooked me on a Doha-Sydney flight. I rang them to ask what has happened and they say the Doha-Auckland flight has been cancelled so I will have to travel to Sydney and pay for the Sydney-Auckland flight. On online forums I can see they have offered free replacement flights to other customers but are now refusing to do this any more. This is against EU aviation law EC261 which states Qatar are liable for rerouting costs when they choose to cancel flights. It also goes against what it states in their own terms and conditions. They are telling me I will have to pay Â£2000+ to book alternative flights. I have already booked non-refundable connecting flights on other airlines so this decision by Qatar Airways is going to cost me thousands of pounds unless they change their minds. They couldn't care less for their own customers.,Detractor
"  We had Qatar Airways business class flights for December 2016 (booked in early May) from Munich to Auckland via Doha, which were also confirmed. In May 2016, we found out that the flights were canceled, allegedly because the route was cancelled due to delivery difficulties of the A350, and thus the Boeing 777-200LR is used on other routes. The German/Polish Qatar Airways Call Center offered generous manner, either to refund our ticket, or to move the trip to February, which is not possible, however, because the lodges are already booked for the tour in New Zealand, and not may be canceled. A flight to Sydney and then a connecting flight to Auckland was declined by Qatar Airways, because obviously the One World partner Qantas no longer operates since 17/05/2016 with Qatar together. Thus, Qatar Airways does not even follow its own conditions of carriage and does not substitute transportation! Such poor service I have not yet seen.",Detractor

"  Melbourne to Munich via Doha with Qatar Airways. Really good price on tickets. Flights between Melbourne and Doha were aboard a B777-300ER. A comfortable plane for long haul flights. Good leg room (and I'm a big guy). Entertainment system was good - plenty of new and old movies to choose from as well as other entertainment. As good as any I've seen (including Emirates). The food was mixed. Return flights were better than outbound and breakfast seemed to be the least favorite. But some great tasting dinners were served for economy class. Service was generally good, but better on return flights. Overall, relaxed, friendly and efficient. Doha airport was a pain due to the transit security screening (which seems pointless), but the airport itself was good. Strangely, I'd like to recommend the Burger King there. Generally found that the Boeing planes were more comfortable than Airbus. Cushioning and leg room were much better on the former.

"After travelling with Ethiad for a while we decided to give Qatar Airways a go flying from Sydney to Rome via Doha. The first experience was not very promising. In Sydney the organisation was haphazard and slow, it took ages to get to a counter. The trip itself was fine - we got a two seater which gave us some more wriggle room - what was disappointing was the relative poor selection of movies available - on a 14 hour flight I found one to watch. Service was fine, I chose to forgo dinner as it was too late and breakfast (nothing appealing). Transit through Doha was relatively straightforward and the airport is well appointed. Doha to Rome was ok - no major issues although paradoxically we had a greater range of movies for the relatively shorter flight (5 hours). Later in April the flight was reversed - check in at Rome was relatively quick and certainly more efficient than Sydney - flight was fine. We had a couple of days stopover in Doha which was interesting. The flight back was good - check in was very smooth and time to check out the airport was welcomed.",Passive
"Jakarta to Istanbul via Doha with Qatar Airways. CGK-DOH leg was on a Boeing 787 and my first time onboard this aircraft. Love the big windows but legroom is surprisingly tight and the configuration of 3-3-3 really makes this aircraft look quite cramped and the aisle is also narrow. Despite this, the service given by the crew is excellent, received 2 meals for this 8 hour flight, a supper and breakfast while during the course of this red eye flight, the FA's are constantly going round the cabin offering drinks. Second flight on an old Airbus 330, with much better legroom. IFE is also the older type and a bit hard to control via the seat controller as it was not a touch screen. Service is also good from friendly cabin crews and arrived in Istanbul on time. Qatar Airways offer a good price on their long haul route and will fly them again but they really have to improve on their legroom especially on the 787 and they also converting their 777 from 3-3-3 to more cramped seating of 3-4-3.",Passive
"  Paris to Goa via Doha on 2nd May. Departure/Arrival is from our local airport and food free baggage allowance. Poor service by crew on board and the meal service was below expectations, the portion size left me still hungry. I tried to get the attention of the stewardess to ask for more bread each time she walked past, but was ignored being too far away in my window seat. This, in spite of the fact that my call light was on for well over 45 minutes. Finally managed to ask for bread when they came to collect the trays! The service takes a long time in coming and when it does, they serve the drinks and meals in a single pass and don't come back to ask if you'd like your drink refreshed. Surely they can manage to serve an aperitif first so that passengers can relax while waiting for crew to get the meals ready. For the quick snack before landing we were served a puff pastry roll with some spicy chicken filling. The filling was okay, the pastry, terrible. The standard 3x3x3 seat configuration means that window seat passengers are 2 seats away from the aisle. As a result I was forced to remain in my seat without visiting the rest room for hours as I did not wish to inconvenience the passengers seated beside me until one decided to take a walk, himself. The reason we have so far continued to fly with Qatar Airways is the convenience of flying direct to our end destination without necessitating an overnight hotel stay.",Detractor

"  Philadelphia to Doha, and more complete disregard for Privilege Club Platinum members. Originated travel with American Airlines in Washington, ending in Kuwait with Qatar Airways via DOH. Bad weather in PHL led to a ground stop in DCA, delaying departure by about 45 minutes. I eventually arrived in PHL with a full hour before departure of QR728 to DOH. I was concerned about my one piece of checked luggage making the connection from AA to QR in PHL. I was assured at the gate that all luggage had been loaded. Then the gate supervisor boarded the aircraft to inform me that my luggage had not, in fact, been transferred from AA to QR. I thought of deplaning, but as assured that it would be put on another QR flight that evening from JFK, BOS, MIA, IAD or ORD. PHL is only one of two QR flights from the US that departs in the morning. QR had a good 10 hours to figure out how to get my bag to another US departure city for a QR flight to DOH that evening. On arrival in DOH, no one was there to greet me on disembarkation to provide me any information, despite being a platinum member of Privilege Club and a very frequent flyer with a lucrative corporate account. At the first class lounge in DOH prior to my onward flight to KWI, I asked about my bag. The system showed no information. The agent at the reception said she'd phone around to find out where it is. A few minutes later, she located me in the lounge to inform me that my bag was still sitting in PHL and would travel tomorrow on QR728, a full 24 hours later. QR had ample time to get my bag to another US city for a departure on a QR flight to DOH that same evening. I am annoyed and feel that Qatar Airways did not handle this properly and risks losing their high yield customers if this is how they manage things. To add insult to injury, from the first class lounge to gate D1 for the KWI flight is a long walk and one would think that there would be buggies available at the exit from the first class lounge to transport first class passengers to remote gates. Despite assurances in DOH that someone would greet me on arrival in KWI, of course, there was no one there. I waited for nearly an hour in the airport QR office for the staff to come after seeing off the flight that I came in on.",Passive
"  I had been hearing many favourable reviews of Qatar Airways so I took advantage of a great low fare (bit over $1k) and gave them a try, and was not disappointed for my flights from Washington Dulles to Singapore via Doha. Clean comfortable passenger cabins with some of the best leg-room and seat-room I've experienced in tourist class, plus decent food and drinks, and very friendly and responsive staff who really proved their mettle on the last of the four flights I took (Doha - Washington Dulles). It was a full flight with many elderly passengers (apparently travelling as a group), some two dozen of whom required wheelchairs, and departure was delayed somewhat, but through boarding and the flight itself the cabin crew proved more than equal to the challenge, with requests handled quickly (even a couple of toilet-roll-outage situations were remedied promptly once passengers made crew members aware of them) and a friendly, congenial air retained throughout. This is an airline much honoured for the quality of its inflight service, and on the four flights I took they were definitely on 5-star form.",Promoter
"With my qcredits I bought an upgrade to Business class for the 9 hour fight from Hong Kong to Doha. I got seat 1K, and I can fully recline the seat to a bed. I am 183cm and fitted perfectly into the seat. The food (beef) and the desert (ice cream and cheese cake) were really good. In addition I want to mention the friendly cabin staff from Korea and the Philippines.",Promoter
Return flight back to Australia from London - a month apart. All four flights on a B777. Perth to Doha - flight 1hr delayed due to medical issue with passenger. Plane brand new and comfortable all round. Big screen and good films. Qatar worked hard to get us (30+ passengers) through Doha security and held plane to London. Doha - London - bit older plane but still good. Return: London - Doha - new plane again and quite empty so 3 seats to myself. Doha-Perth - older 777 but not busy so room to spread out. All planes - good leg room and width for economy. Price - always the cheapest of the 5 star airlines. Entertainment - plenty. Service - always attentive and courteous. Food - ok but hot food quite cold on some flights. Not the tastiest of dishes. Overall recommended and I'll be booking again.,Promoter
"  We travelled from London to Bangkok return via Doha in April 2016, and this was our first time in Business Class. We were not disappointed, it was amazing!

We would not hesitate to travel with Qatar again, well done for a great experience.",Promoter
"  Flew Qatar Airways from Hong Kong to Johannesburg via Doha. All flights were on time and arrived early. As usual high standard of food and service, but it beats me why when getting on the plane in Hong Kong at just after midnight, they serve dinner at about 1am, surely it is better to serve a snack then a full breakfast. Breakfast very basic served at about 3am Doha time. On the return 02.55am out of Doha, full Dinner is again served then a mediocre breakfast just before arrival at 4pm. As to the planes, both types were very good, although I found the foot space a little tight on both planes (window Seat). The crew however were excellent and the flights were good. As a member of the club, you are well treated. Films were the same in and out, although the return was on May 1st they had not changed to movies over.",Promoter
"London Heathrow to Tokyo Narita via Doha. I heard positive reviews about this airline from friends so I thought I'd book my flight to Japan with Qatar Airways. Days before my flight I got the opportunity to upgrade, which I did as I had money to spare and for a long haul I thought this would be perfect. Dressed in a t-shirt, joggers and trainers upon entering the aircraft and presenting my ticket for business class I got a look of disgust - almost as though I didn't and should have been there. How dare someone dressed for eight months worth of travelling be seated in business class right? Offended to say the least. The seats and food was wonderful. Everything you expect from a good airline like Qatar Airways and for business class. It was my first time flying business so I was definitely enjoying it despite the look I received when I arrived onboard. I decided to ignore this although it gets worse. Everybody in the entire cabin got the best of service. Not me! It's almost like they were deliberately not willing to serve me a drink or food etc. I found this service pretty shocking. 11 hours on a plane and served two drinks? Disgusted. I hate complaining and causing drama but personally this goes to show people judge you. I had the money to spend on my flight and therefore I should have received the same service as everyone else in that cabin. I'm pretty let down as this was my first time with Qatar Airways. You should never judge someone by the clothes they're wearing or lack of make up etc. So I didn't look like a business class flyer but I'm a nice person who wanted to enjoy me flight and ended up feeling tense thanks to the staff onboard my flight. Will make me think twice about upgrading with them or even flying with them. Next time I'll stick with economy class where aparently I belong. I'll be sure to share this experience with friends and family.",Passive

"  Birmingham to Dubai via Doha return on Qatar Airways. The experience was amazing, staff were very friendly, attentive and professional.

I would recommend this airline.",Promoter
"Doha to London with Qatar Airways. A good flight except for the moody hand control of the entertainment system, the lack of interesting stuff to watch, the female FA who completely ignored me in the lounge onboard this A380 aircraft, and a demanding family who seemed to assume the FAs were there personal servants (the bell was called around 100 times during the flight). The aircraft started moving from the stand and they were all still standing and talking, and the attendant did not say a word to them, even though they were right next to them. Qatar Airways need to overhaul the control and the content of their entertainment system, it is annoying for being extra sensitive and films were old. It is a global airline and most of us do not mind watching a kiss. Food was sensational and service impeccable, apart from the FA in the lounge who could not care less. I went there for a drink to escape the noisy and demanding family taking up the entire from row of business, but she was not welcoming and ignored me completely. After 10 minutes I gave up. I complained to the CSD who was very apologetic. She seemed busy doing something but she was not serving any other passenger. But all in all a good flight. The free wifi they say they offered did not work.",Passive
"  Bangkok to Frankfurt via Doha on Qatar Airways, and both legs were on time, seats comfy, staff very friendly. Could have checked more often during the night if drinks were needed. My choice of gluten-free meals had been respected on our outbound flight, on the return flight they forgot about it. The movie choice was interesting. But on the leg Doha to Frankfurt I could neither finish the film that I had started on the first leg nor enjoy any other of them. Shortly after the start, my entertainment system broke down completely out of the blue. As some rows in front of me, a passenger seemed to have a medical problem, the steward was not able to look after such a minor problem as mine. So I was not even able to enjoy all the reworked blurred-skin-sequences that made my husband laugh, as I sat on the other side of the aisle and could not watch his screen either. By chance, I had a good book, and after an hour or so, I fell asleep. As I had another problem with my entertainment computer on the outflight, too, I think Qatar should check their IFE more regularly.",Promoter
"  Frankfurt to Bangkok via Doha with Qatar Airways. Ground service in Frankfurt was very helpful and nice. Both legs were on time, seats comfy, staff was very friendly.

Only complaint: on the leg Doha-Bangkok, my entertainment computer stopped the film every now and then and rewinded till I pushed the play-button. I tried two other films - the same.",Promoter
"  Melbourne to Rome via Doha, returning from Milan and flights were excellent, better than what Qantas offered. QF business class lounge used in Melbourne, flight left on time.

PJs soft cotton and available in S-M size, QF take note! Amenities kit generous, it contained a full size tube of Armani moisturiser, mini Si perfume, lip cream, comb and usual items. FAs charming and seemed genuine in their desire to make the flight as comfortable and enjoyable as possible, their English was excellent. Toilets were spotless at all times. My mobile phone was left at the business class lounge in Doha, no problem for the airline, and it was delivered back to me a week later, that's service. Business class lounge Doha a little hard to find but impressive. Excellent service in cafÃ©, more formal dining room of business class lounge was on upper floor. Fabulous airline for long haul flights from Australia to Europe and beyond.",Promoter

I was hoping to catch up on some film or TV programme but the irritating and unpredictable control made this impossible. I got all possible languages but English.",Passive
"  We had to fly to Brussels which just had the terrorist attack. We understood that Qatar could not fly us to Brussels. They forced us to choose a European airport that Qatar Airways flies to. Paris, Madrid, London or Frankfurt. If we did not choose we would not be allowed to travel to Doha, where we should have had a stopover. We chose Frankfurt as it is reasonably close to Brussels. However we were very surprised and furious when Qatar Airways ground staff told us we would be on our own in Frankfurt. You have to find the rest of the way yourself. Other airlines had ground transportation available to get the passengers to Brussels. We had to spend a lot of money to finally get to Brussels. We will not fly Qatar again.",Detractor
"  Qatar Airways are still using it's old business class seats on the MAN flights. Fly to London, Edinburgh or Birmingham (and many other places in Europe) and you get the lovely new flat beds which are considerably better. But to Manchester the now tired inclined seats and average tv monitors are used. Food still good though. Clearly there are some economies being made with cheaper champagne and they used to feed you twice, second time with a lovely afternoon tea. Now it's a main meal then ""snacks on request"". I upgraded from economy to business using QCredits that are given to frequent fliers. Not sure I'd do it again for the MAN flight.

The meal is quite substantial for a morning flight, with interesting Arabian items and huge portion for the main course. Even a morning flight, we were given an overnight kit by Armani. That's why Qatar is a 5-star airline by all accounts. On time arrival.",Promoter

"I have been flying with Qatar a number of times and have always given positive feedback especially when their flight service is superb. But when things go wrong they go very wrong. Recent trip DXB to SYD, we missed our connection in Doha as we were late to the gate and got lost changing gates. We were informed we would need to pay a very large sum of money to move to the next flight although we are premium and the class ticket was the exact same. It was this or cancel the holiday and pay for a flight back to Dubai until then they refused to release our bags - we paid the large amount and paid for hotels. On the return leg I requested the cabin crew to make the bed, I had my phone charging in the side panel. I slept and on awaking I went to take my phone to find it down the side of the bed. To my horror it was crushed to peices, I can only assume that when making the bed it was moved and the seat moved to create the bed so crushing it, the seat was not moved in any way before or after. CSD apologised prefusily, gave me her bosses email. Arrived in Doha, and connection missed to DWC as flight was late and parked on remote stand, told another 8 hours wait. I am told not their fault, well whose is it then? I followed up these issues with emails and received two emails from a customer care rep saying we are sorry blah blah, no offer to replace the phone at least, it is not their fault, no offer to look into fight connections issues, no reply from any of the exec team. I will never set foot on them again. The customer care is appaling and reply with copy and paste answers so do not waste your time. In the air fantastic, on the ground words escape me.",Detractor

"  I've flown Qatar Airways several times before and always loved the in-flight service and the food. However, never before did anything go wrong. Business class trip to Oman, and on departure from Heathrow they held the plane for an hour and a half for late arriving passengers (so announced the pilot to the passengers). Didn't make any time up in the air, and on landing at Doha it meant half the plane missed our connections, including me, which meant being stranded in Qatar for a night. Qatar Airways insisted I stay in the airline-owned hotel a shuttle bus ride away from the airport, despite my request to stay in the airport hotel. I got no sleep due to the noise and 4am wake up call, and they charged me USD$21 for an hour of Internet access. Missed my morning of meetings in Oman due to the rescheduled flight. The shocking thing is that on return no one cared an ounce about the fact their decision to hold the plane in London - not weather or mechanical. I asked for compensation for the $21 I had to spend on their hotel's Internet and was refused. True customer service shows through when things go badly and Qatar failed in this case. In short, inflight service is definitely one of the best airlines in the world. But if anything goes wrong with your trip, you do not want to be flying Qatar.",Detractor

Food was okay but had better DOH to HKT on Boeing 777, more space and thus more comfortable. IFE was more modern and had touchscreen but prefer Emirates IFE. Love flying on the A380, lots of room and very quiet in the cabin. IFE again more modern and similar to the Boeing 777. Last sector DOH to MAN again on A330, same as the outward leg. Crew on all legs were efficient but some were not overly friendly. The big bonus now with Qatar Airways is the new airport in Doha which is a huge improvement over the old one",Passive

"My husband and I were flying Qatar Airways from London Heathrow to Durban King Shaka via Doha for the first time since moving to England. We had booked through a travel agent. On March 24 we left with adequate time to get to the airport. Unfortunately, due to the tube strike, traffic on London roads was manic. Needless to say we arrived at the airport when check-in had closed and was informed that we could not board our flight. Our travel agent was unreachable to find an alternate flight and all other airlines were closed or not going to Doha where we were to make our connecting flight. Our hearts sank, thinking that we would not get to reunite with our family for Easter. Then my husband received a call from Qatar Airways help desk where one of the staff who had heard our case somehow found a way to get us onto the flight. She went beyond her duty to help us and for that we are grateful. We will definitely fly Qatar again. The rest of the trip including the return went off hitch free.",Promoter

"  We were due to travel from Cape Town to Brussels and I phoned Qatar Airways office three days before our departure to ask if Brussels airport was still closed after the bombings. I was told that it would be open but I asked what would happen if it was not open and I was informed that passengers would be put on flights to Amsterdam, Paris or Dusseldorf. I therefore printed off our boarding passes to Brussels two days before the flight as requested. When we arrived at Cape Town airport 3.5 hours before the flight, we were told that our flights had been cancelled and we would have to rebook. At the booking office, we were told that there were no seats available on flights to Amsterdam, Paris, Dusseldorf or London Heathrow and all they could offer us were flights to Birmingham. If Qatar had sent us an email to inform us that our flights had been cancelled, we might have been able to find much more suitable alternatives in time. We accepted very reluctantly to fly to Birmingham, as this was extremely inconvenient, only to be told that the airline would not organise or pay for onward travel from Birmingham to Brussels. We also faced a wait of 7 hours at Doha airport instead of the previously scheduled 2 hours. We asked if there was a possibility of an upgrade or a place in the Business lounge but we were told that it was not company policy. At Doha airport, we tried to book train tickets from Birmingham to London and from London to Brussels on the Eurostar but there were no printing facilities we could find. It was also cold and extremely noisy, with the children's play area right next to the quiet room .Our train tickets cost us Â£33 each and Eurostar tickets 382 euros, out of our own pocket. We finally arrived at Birmingham airport to discover there were no trains that day to London, due to overhead cables being down. We finally arrived in Brussels at 11.30pm, having been due to arrive originally at 7.25am. An email of complaint to Qatar Airways was met with the inflexibility we had encountered from the supervisor at Cape Town airport.

"  A bad experience with a big family on the flight from Cape Town to Doha that basically took over the business section, messed up the bathrooms and used the space in front of the toilets for praying - so much so, that one felt guilty to get up to use the lavatory. This family also had a child, that was screaming for nine hours. The child is not to blame - the parents did not pack single toy or drawing book etc. Original ticket had a layover in Doha of more than 8 hours that with complimentary hotel. Qatar changed the times which resulted in the cancellation of this hotel booking. I was assured by there are ample sleeping opportunities in the Business lounge in Doha but do not bet on this. Lounge was cold and too noisy for sleeping. Quiet zone was occupied so you are waiting there for your next flight until the next morning. Next shorter flight in bad business seat in A320 and I could not sleep properly. Will not book again if they have a layover of less than 8 hours.",Detractor

"Amsterdam to Bangkok via Doha with Qatar Airways. Amsterdam - Doha leg was the Boeing 787-800. Fortunatly the ground staff at Amsterdam Airport assigned me to an exit row seat, which gave me more legroom. This worked out well for me, since the normal seats on the B787 are too small and only have 31 inch pitch. Avoid the Boeing 787 at all costs. On arrival in Doha we were transported by busses to the terminal and welcomed by a long queue for a security check. It took quite some time as they had only 2 or 3 stations open, with several international flights arriving at the same time. With the new departure time from Amsterdam (18.15 instead of 14.40) you may have only minutes to transfer (depending where you're flying next of course) and that might turn out to be too short.

"  Copenhagen to Melbourne visa Doha return. This was a fantastic business class experience and I understand now the recognition QR get for their product. From ground to air, they are streets ahead of most airlines. The 1-2-1 seating on the Boeing 787 is amazing, comfortable and provides an intimate and private space on a long flight - even the 2-2-2 seating on the Boeing 777 was a very respectable product. The catering is fantastic, on all flights the quality was high and beautifully presented. The Barramundi in Saffron sauce I was served on the way back from Melbourne, was something I would be very happy with at a high end restaurant! There biggest asset is their staff who provide consistent and warm hospitality. I was greeted by name on boarding on several flights, including with 'salaam' which was a nice touch. The lounge staff were friendly without being overbearing and the guy manning the showers outbound deserves a massive pat on the back as he went out of his way to ensure I had everything I needed to get refreshed. Outbound on my flight DOH-MEL I was unwell so unfortunately didn't get to enjoy the catering (which looked amazing from the menu) or bar but was well looked after by staff onboard the flight including the CSD who checked up on me throughout the flight. Inbound on the last leg to CPH, my seat area hadn't been cleaned properly due to late landing and turnaround of the plane.

Doha to Vienna and Qatar Airways is really a 5 Star airline. The Boeing 787 seats were in the 1x2x1 configuration which makes a lot of room for the business class travellers.

Second flight with Qatar Airways from Zurich to Melbourne. First flight to Doha was in Boeing 787 with single seat at window and now in 2 seats at the window in Boeing 777. What a difference: you have no direct access to the aisle and seats in 777 are less comfortable. Food was just good as in the Boeing 787. Qatar Airways uses Boeing 777 to Australia so good for couples. If you travel alone you should take a seat in the middle row to have direct access to aisle.

There was one size of pyjama left and that was XL. As I was sitting in seat 2B it was difficult to understand why these shortages occurred. Whilst the flight left at 3am and arrived at 9pm, window blinds were closed and it was treated as if it was a night flight which meant you had to buzz if you wanted anything.

The food is really excellent (some of the dishes came close to food quality on Swiss First!) The crew were young and very different from one flight to the other, but in general friendly and efficient. I reckon Qatar Airways crew is better in most ways then their competitors from the Middle East.

"Frankfurt to Doha in economy class on B777, and a fabulous experience with Qatar Airways. Check in at FRA was a bit slow, but everything else went well. Staff onboard the plane were kind and welcoming, and service was attentive for this quite short flight. Food was okay, not brilliant but plenty of drinks offered during the flight. Cabin was very clean and nice, the inflight entertainment seemed to be close to Emirates choices and all worked well. Definitely choose for future trips if schedule suitable.",Promoter
"The customer service were rude both in the airport and on the telephone - I tried by email but they took around a week to reply to each email which they had clearly not read. I found the legroom was not enough. The cabin crew don't do any kind of beverage service, you kind of have to get their attention to get a drink. As for the in-seat entertainment although there is a good choice of stuff to watch, the screens use a touch-screen control which doesn't seem very sensitive, meaning you get people tapping the back of your seat with a great deal of force - not great if you want to sleep. The screens are actually a bit too big, meaning if the seat in front goes back it's so much in your face it's not pleasant.",Detractor
"This was our first time with Qatar Airways from Manchester to Bangkok via Doha, but it won't be our last. The seating on all aircraft's that we flew in were excellent especially the A380 which was brilliant, followed by the 777 which had so much space. The cleanliness of the planes was excellent, the staff were friendly and very attentive to our requirements, the menu was very good and the selection of wines onboard were also very good. The food was served quickly when asked for as they offer serve on demand which is ideal when having two flights within a very short time, in fact the food was too plentiful on the first flight from BKK that after picking up our flight to Manchester we couldn't manage any more. Great airline, will certainly use again on my next flight.",Promoter
Washington to Kilimanjaro via Doha. We have flown business on several different airlines and Qatar Airways was very impressive. The flight attendants were exceptionally friendly and helpful â€“ seemed a cut above the others. We had a long layover between our flights and Qatar put us up in a hotel in both directions free of charge. That was impressive. Their lounge in Doha is huge and one of the best we have ever seen. Customer service was impeccable. If I could give them 6 stars I would.,Promoter
"Stockholm to Bangkok via Doha, and overall a good experience with Qatar Airways. However, the Boeing 787 between Stockholm and Doha had less leg room and width then the A380 between Doha and BKK. Other than that the overall service was better on A380. It was my feeling that the A380 flagship routes has higher priority, meal services seemed to run more smoothly on A380, there was also a menu handed out on the A380. Entertaiment system was better on A380. Qatar is a great airline. However, if the 787 is not comfortable enough for long-haul flights.",Passive
"I travelled on Qatar Airways from Los Angeles to Hyderabad via Doha, the first time I was travelling on Qatar Airways. I would say they are truly a 5 star airline, and they have high standards in service and quality. The food was good and service was very prompt and courteous. I flew in Economy and the seats are wide and comfortable. The transit was hassle free in Doha. Overall a very good experience.",Promoter
"Zurich to Sydney via Doha. Overall an okay experience. but with the new excess baggage rates probably the last time I've flown with them.

Colombo to Johannesburg via Doha with Qatar Airways. An excellent Business Class. Seats are magnificent with attentive crew throughout the flight. Pre drinks served before take off and variety of pre drinks as well. Food is well prepared and tasty. Air Hostesses greet you by the name and made you feel special. Pajamas handed out before take off which is unheard of in business class. Spacious cabins and lay flat seats. By far the best airline I have flown.,Promoter
"Doha to Barcelona. Clean, spacious seating and friendly service of the crew, the attention to detail was stand out. I had many worried when the plane takes off since my mother was sick. My mother got sick from the claustrophobia and fear of heights for a long time flight But I told this fact to crew, she asked to the passengers the excuse and she took a step for my mother can lie down. In addition, she frequently checked my mother's condition, and she asked if my mother needs. It might be small kindness because of her duty, but for my family, it was really impressive service. Although the many time goes by, I'd like to compliment the crew at the time.",Promoter
Jeddah to Bangkok via Doha. Excellent planes on all legs and very punctual. Good choice of food and reasonable selection of drinks. JED to DOH route half empty so much better and more frequent refreshment service than the A380. One negative is the music.

They are no 1 for me, and I will definitely take Qatar Airways again for my upcoming long hauls.",Promoter
"A few firsts for me on this Qatar Airways trip to Bangkok - the A380, the Boeing 787 plus the new Doha airport. Whole trip was a masterclass on flying from check in and facilities at London Heathrow T4, amazing A380 the new airport at Doha and fasttrack at Bangkok. The crews were very helpful and friendly (in the A380 bar they really excelled), food and wine so enjoyable that seconds were offered if available! If there was any downside it was the Boeing 787 - after the space of the A380 it felt noisy, the blinds didn't keep the setting sun out, and something of a throwback to narrow bodied longhaul aircraft but without the romance - I am old enough to remember 707s and the DC8s. All in all a perfect journey and naturally will be booking again",Promoter
"We booked already many times our flights with Qatar Airways. The service can't be better, but the food on our Doha to Colombo flight and back is not prepared for European guests, especially for the night and the early morning flights. We were disappointed with that food. The business lounge they use at Colombo Airport is poor with old bread, no cheese or meat, only crackers, and the staff were very unfriendly.",Passive
"Munich to Phuket via Doha with Qatar Airways. The flight from Munich to Doha was a great experience on brand new A350 with very attentive staff, all helpful. Good organization with Limousine service in Doha. When booking Business or First a limousine service to the airport in a radius of 50 km from the airport in Germany would be desirable.",Promoter
"Penang to Manchester via Doha. We travelled as a family with a toddler and I was disappointed we couldn't book our seats together in advance - they couldn't get us seats together during check in but luckily on both journeys the seat next to my wife been blocked so we were able to seat together. I was told its because they needed to block off for another parent but there is only space for one bassinet! The sitting arrangements were 2x4x2 and we had the 2 seats by the window. I felt it would have been much more helpful if the airline allowed families to book seats together from the start instead of trying to sort it out onboard or at the gate. Food was nice but stewardess doesnt seem so attentive. Leg room space seem good, the 30kg luggage allowance is generous, but our baby pram seem to have got lost on our return journey - we got it back 1 day later. In flight movies seem limited and difficult to browse through, and no free complimentary wifi on board. From my experience Hamad Airport in Doha is excellent, very clean, fantastic toilets, lots of charging points, and apple imac stations!",Passive
"What is supposed to be 'a dream - a seat above the rest' isn't what I experienced. On the second leg of my journey, from Doha to London, the seat was inoperative and stuck in the upright position throughout. More comfort would have been found in an Economy seat. To add insult to injury, Qatar are only offering Qmiles rather than refunding my fee.",Detractor
"Muscat to Ho Chi Minh City via Doha return on business. Brand new Qatar Airways Boeing 777-300ER on the MCT-DOH leg and an elderly A330-200 between Doha and Ho Chi Minh City. The 777 seats are just fabulous! The A330 was equipped with the older seats which stretch out fully but stay slightly inclined. I was a bit disappointed at first but then noticed that the angle was not to bad. I could sleep very well without sliding down. Food and beverages were of excellent quality throughout, including in the new very large business lounge in DOH. The cabin crew was friendly, always available and helpful but never obtrusive. Check-in swift both in MCT and SGN. I would fly Qatar Airways again.",Promoter
"London to Colombo via Doha with Qatar Airways, the first leg was on a Boeing 787, my first experience of this aircraft. The noise in the rear economy cabin was incredible and we were moved forward to the next cabin. This was better but noisier than say a 777. Food on this leg was poor and although the wine was of good quality, it was dispensed in horrible cups. The other 3 legs were much better. The A340 is a comfortable plane and the A380 can't be beaten. My overall impression was I was in economy and should not be allowed to forget it. Doha is a far better airport than Dubai.",Passive
"Flew Qatar Airways from London Heathrow to Bangkok via Doha. First time aboard the A380, and what a product. Check-in at LHR was a bit of a drag unfortunately. IFE is particularly good on board with plenty to choose from to fill a long flight. Good standard of food and drink during the flight all served by very pleasant crew. Hamad International is like a breath of fresh air after the nightmare of the old Doha International Airport. If you have a long layover, would recommend the airport hotel. All in all, another very pleasant trip with QR, cannot recommend enough.",Promoter
"Doha to Philadelphia with Qatar Airways. Excellent service, and a beautiful business class lounge in Doha Airport.

"Manchester to Cape Town via Doha with Qatar Airways. The flight was smooth but the outward journey became rather uncomfortable due to lack of space. The person in front of me reclined their seat which made it worse. My TV screen became far too close. Doha to Manchester journey was much better as the plane was older. There was more space and seats were more comfortable. The food and drinks service was limited. We needed more water, juice, or even a glass of wine. We were given a small amount with our meal but not enough. The meals were nearly all the same. too much chicken and poor vegetarian option. Some of the food was poor. The film selection was okay. I would want to travel business class if I were to use Qatar Airways again.",Passive

"We flew Qatar Airways from Madrid to Doha on a Boeing 787 and onto Bangkok on the A380, and return. All 4 flights on time and check-in procedures quick and efficient. Onboard the service was very good and seats comfortable and easy to control. I enjoyed the meals I chose and had no problem obtaining my first choices on any of the flights, although on the second leg on both flights I only wanted breakfast. However, my husband was disappointed the vegetarian meals he had pre-ordered. Onboard the staff didn't acknowledge he had ordered a special meal, he was just handed the standard business class menu and had to point out his pre-order to the attendant. If a special meal is ordered it seems only the main course is changed. He had to have the Arabian mezze as a starter. The first vegetarian main course he was served (Madrid-Doha) was a disaster. It was described as Asian vegetarian and was just vegetables and rice and had to be sent back for reheating. On the return journey he abandoned special meal orders and chose the vegetarian option from the main menu instead which were much better. Lounges at Madrid, Bangkok and especially Doha were good, and I was able to take a shower in the very nice private bathrooms in the Al Mourjan lounge in both directions, much appreciated to freshen up between flights.",Promoter
"I recently flew Qatar Airways from London to Bangkok via Doha, returning from Ho Chi Minh City. Around 1.5 hours into your journey you get the meal service. This wasn't preceded with a drinks service, the drink was served with the meal, and service was incredibly slow. After the trays were collected, cabin lights are dimmed, and turned back on two hours before landing where you are given a snack (on the 6 hour leg from LHR to DOH this meant no more than two hours between meals). The snack is cleared but there was still 1.5 hours of the flight remaining - this second service could take place a little later into the flight. Cabin staff should bring a tray of drinks around occasionally but on my flight having a chat in the galley seemed to take priority. If laptops should be turned off during landing / take off the staff should enforce this rule, not just leave it as they do the cabin check. Blankets and headsets should be collected before landing in my opinion. I have recommended this airline but it was a border line decision (swayed by good prices and on time performance).",Passive
"Bangkok to Edinburgh via Doha, after a disappointing outward flight, Qatar Airways service on the return leg was much improved. They still were out of champagne on the Bangkok to Doha leg (rose only) but the food and service were great. Being my first time on an A380 with bar, after dinner we spent a short time there and the staff were absolutely delightful (and they found some white Krug champagne too). The space on both the A380 and Boeing 787 was almost identical and very comfortable. My only gripe is that on the morning flight from Doha to Edinburgh we were hungry and had breakfast shortly after take off on a 7.5 hour flight. By 5 hours into the flight all we had been offered was drinks, tea and coffee. After mentioning I was peckish, I was given a packet of chocolate cookies. About an hour out of Edinburgh, the cabin crew discreetly asked the few passengers who looked hungry if they wanted a snack and brought out some bits and pieces (I had ravioli and someone else a cheeseboard). I got the feeling this was leftovers rather than an actual snack service since they kept running out of dishes and not everyone received something. Maybe a little self-help sandwich bar would work on this flight?",Promoter
"Edinburgh to Doha. Plenty space, comfortable seats and smooth flight. Service was poor though. Only 24 Business seats yet ran out of champagne before take off, ran out of soup, cold starter, and cheese board - suggested I take crackers and share with the person next to me. Then ran out of NZ Sauvignon Blanc and offered dessert wine instead. Made a formal complaint but I'm still waiting for a response.",Passive

"Flew from Manchester to Goa via Doha with Qatar Airways. Check in very good, fast and efficient, fast tracked through security then to the lounge in Manchester. Boarding very quick and flight on time, first leg on an A330, the seats very comfortable and fully flat. FA very nice and efficient, landed in Doha ahead of time. Went straight to Qatar Airways business class lounge, in my opinion better than some top hotels I have stopped in (wish we had had a longer stopover). Then to goa via A320, again FA very nice and efficient, this aircraft very small seats not very comfortable only recline so far (a 3hr flight). Landed in Goa ahead of time again, return journey on A320 again to Doha, slight delay on leaving Goa so didn't have time to visit lounge in Doha. Boeing 787 this time to Manchester, what a plane in business class 1x2x1 configuration seats very comfortable, service once again very good, FA a credit to the airline. I didn't sample any food as I slept for 6hrs of the 7hr flight. I will definitely be flying again with Qatar Airways, hopefully they will sort a different plane from Doha to Goa.",Promoter

Overall I would recommend this airline.",Promoter
"Ho Chi Minh City to Doha on Qatar Airways. Ground services relatively efficient, the SGN lounge was full, limited selection of food and beverages. Nice clean aircraft, new seat design recently installed - comfortable and roomy with good IFE. Catering on board was disappointing, chosen entrÃ©e and dessert were unavailable - I was offered captain's meal instead but declined. Service chaotic, then all meal choices suddenly available 2 hours into flight. Champagne available on tarmac, ordered more for post takeoff only to be told later that there was no champagne available for the flight, several wines also out of stock. This was the most chaotic food and beverage service seen on a Qatar flight, staff were largely indifferent. Wine list on the route appears to have been downgraded since early 2015 and amenity kit appears to be shrinking. Otherwise the flight was non-eventful, arrived Doha to a bus disembarkation for a full A330 which was not enjoyable.",Passive
"Inflight, Qatar Airways are fine, with good IFE, food and service. However, when things go wrong it was different. The BKK-DOH flight was ready to leave when they decided to take 2 people off (no idea why) and whilst their luggage was being removed the gurney hit the side of the plane and caused some damage. Not the fault of the airline, this stuff happens. After 2+ hours on the plane with no information we disembarked. After getting breakfast, I noticed there was a new gate on the departures board. Arriving at the gate, there were around 300 people crowded round a desk with 2 computers and 5 staff, who were apparently trying to get people on different flights. After 3 hours without any discernable progress someone came and told us to move to a lounge. Staff disappeared for 5 hours. Eventually we were told we were moving to a hotel. Having been rushed through customs, our guide ran off leaving me to go downstairs to the Qatar office to find the bus. We were given contradictory information or none at all and the management of the problem was lamentable. Eventually got on a KLM flight 36 hours later (having been told the previous evening that they couldn't book me on another airline). A dreaful experience and I would be reluctant to fly with them again.",Detractor

Returning from Doha to Amsterdam on a trip to Thailand with Qatar Airways on the Boeing 787-800. Cabin layout is 3x3x3 which is ok. Cabin was clean and the crew was great.

Only minor points are the dull snack that is served and that the entertainment system is not as good as on the A380.,Promoter

"I was travelling from Barcelona to Singapore, however the connecting flight from Doha to Singapore cancelled. I understand these things can happen, but the treatment was the worst I experienced. I was sitting in the lounge and noticed a Qatar Airways staff walking around with a sign saying Singapore. He told me the flight had cancelled but I had an option to take the flight to Kuala Lumpur and then another flight to Singapore, and assured me I would be in Singapore by 11pm. He disappeared for around 45 minutes and then came back to collect me at 7.20am. But as the flight was due to depart at 7.40am we had to run to the other side of the airport. At the gate he gave the boarding card for the connecting flight then rushed us onto the aircraft. Only when the plane was taxiing did we discover the boarding card was for a flight that didn't land until 00.15am! He hadn't the courtesy to tell us we were on a different connecting flight. We were met at KL and given paper to put our details as the luggage had not made the flight, but would be couriered to us. 24 hours after landing the luggage hadn't arrived. I contacted Changi Airport to find out Qatar Airways hadn't passed my address and contact details to them. In terms of seat comfort and service does not compare favorably to Singapore Airlines.",Detractor
"Flew Qatar Airways Shanghai to Montreal via Doha on Boeing 777-300ER in Business Class. Check in at Shanghai was smooth and got my pre-selected seat 6K. Was spending time with my partner who sent me off so didn't go to the lounge. The first leg left Shanghai on time and reached Doha 20 mins early. Cabin crew was professional and cheery, refilled my wines and offered me to try their other wines which I thought was a nice touch. Qatar Airways offer Dine on demand for premium cabin passengers. As this was a late night flight only light meals and breakfast were served but they were reasonably nice. Transfer at Doha was seamless and the lounge was huge and airy, quite crowded but had quiet corners to rest alone. The second leg departing Doha was not as good as the first leg. Boarding chaotic, service was still fair but cabin crew seemed robotic and a little disinterested. I ordered lamb as main and it was a little overcooked. Arrived Montreal on time. The seat was very spacious and easy to sleep in, but 2-2-2 seating meant that passengers in window seat had to cross over their neighbors to get out. So for me one of the minddle pair of seats would be your choice. IFE was limited for East Asain people but was reasonable considering their main destinations are within Western.",Passive
"Manchester to Perth return via Doha, and we were very impressed with all aspects of our travel experience with Qatar Airways. All our flights (4 in all) were well organised and on time. The planes were clean and looked new. Cabin crew were very efficient and helpful. Food was very good for 'plane food' and in economy class. Leg room was very acceptable especially as my husband is over 6 feet tall. Entertainment offered was the same on all 4 flights, but was varied and there was plenty to choose from. The airport at Doha was beautiful and its' structure was much admired by my consultant structural engineer husband. On the return flight we had an 8 hour layover at Doha so decided to book the Airport Hotel for 5-8 hour slot. A little pricey but well worth having a rest and a swim for nearly an hour in a stunning pool on the 4th floor overlooking the concourse. I think the staff were somewhat surprised to find a middle aged couple so keen on a swim so early in the morning! So thank you Qatar Airways, you made a long journey more than bearable.",Promoter
"The flight attendants were fantastic on my Qatar Airways flight QR725 from Doha to Chicago. I had a very short layover in Chicago (1hr 40) and we landed late, leaving only 50 minutes to get through immigration, collect bags, go through customs, check in bags again, take the train from terminal 5 to terminal 3, clear security check and get to my gate. I thought it was going to be impossible to make it onto my connecting flight to Cleveland, but the flight attendants were amazing. They ensured I was the first to get off the plane (even before first class passengers). They had called ahead to ground staff members and there was someone waiting for me as I exited the aircraft, with a bright orange sign that allowed me to cut to the front of every line (immigration, security check, etc). I managed to go through all the motions in 40 minutes! Not to mention, the flight attendants knew I was stressed about my short layover and gave me some fancy chocolates before I got off the plane to make me feel a little better!

"Frankfurt to Bangkok via Doha with Qatar Airways. Overall very good experience with some minor flaws. The A350 is a fantastic plane, the A380 also. The seat is very good although the legroom in sleeping position (under the stowing room of the seat in front) could be better, especially if you turn your body when sleeping. The much advertised mattresses are no longer in use. Food is good to very good considered plane conditions. Unfortunately my order (given directly after take off) on the first leg could not be delivered exactly, as they gave away my first course and also the GewÃ¼rztraminer wine was no longer available. The IFE comes with a very nice 17"" screen (not stowable). Movie selection could be better for new releases.

They impress me with consistently high standards on the ground and in the air. I will always chose to fly with Qatar even if means a stopover rather than a direct flight on another carrier - and always above British Airways who consistently disappoint me! This time I travelled in First Class from Doha to Bangkok and return, and it was outstanding in every way! Discreet, personal, professional and comfortable all the way! Qatar Airways have their service up to the highest standards possible. It was lovely to see caviar in First Class and a superb selection of wines and champagnes. Entertainment, amenities, sleeper suits and slippers all of great quality and I was able to fully enjoy and fully rest both ways. Their ground service match the inflight services with superb lounges in both London and Doha.

"Tokyo Haneda to London Heathrow via Doha. I arrived at Tokyo Haneda 6 hours prior to departure due to a domestic flight, but I couldn't check my bags in until 2 hours prior. Japan Airlines handle Qatar Airways at HND, and their check in desks are always open, so I don't know why they can't take their partners bags early. It was also disappointing that Premium Class pax can't use the fast rack security lanes here. But you do get access to Japan Airlines First/Premium Sakura lounge, which has all the facilities you need. Boeing 787 left a few mins late, and once airborne I was asleep on the very comfortable lie flat seat. When I woke up I dined (on demand) on good quality Japanese and Western food, and then rested for the rest of this 12 hour sector. Transfer at DOH was slightly less chaotic than outbound, but it is noticeable that the volume of transfer pax has not been well planned for and security is somewhat lax to get pax through quickly. Signage in DOH is poor, and I struggled to find my way to the Business lounge. Boarding the A380 was a treat (my first time) - we were warmly welcomed by a charming FA who took our coats and offered us a drink. I cannot believe how quiet the A380 is, especially on take-off. We had a great flight, enjoying the lounge bar for a cocktail before lunch, having a nap in the great seats (same as 787) and watching the IFE, A top class journey! But I could not connect to the internet, as it was very slow. So in my free 15 mins worth I didn't download a single page.",Promoter
"Doha to Hong Kong on an older A330, the seats are not at all bad, but not 5 star in my opinion. Boarding was slow and the service is not great. The onboard staff was incredibly helpful and nice, food was decent, and I found the entertainment system average. I am not a fan of Qatar yet, but I find the staff members do stand out.",Passive
"Johannesburg to Muscat via Doha with Qatar Airways. At Johannesburg the check in was smooth. Bagagge allowance was reasonable too. The aircraft was very clean and had a fresh smell. Cabin crew was warm and welcoming, our seats were comfortable and meals were well prepared and tasted good. Transfer through Doha was fast and efficient. We had a 2 hour layover and still managed to do duty free shopping. Boarding our A321 we then flew to Muscat where we experienced the same great treatment. We then landed with ease thanks too the well trained Pilots. I would recommend Qatar Airways.",Promoter
"Copenhagen to Doha with Qatar Airways. Check in at Copenhagen was incredibly slow. Onboard I found service slow given this was a night flight and everyone wanted to sleep. The inflight entertainment is a bit slow for me and it takes a long time for example to continue watching a TV Series. Its not bad, but not best in class.",Passive
"Chicago to Kathmandu via Doha with Qatar Airways. Incredible service! First leg of the journey was 14 hrs and there were 4 meals served with choices of entrees and alcohol beverage choices included for no additional charge. The second leg of the journey began at 1:05 am and the flight attendant began by saying, ""when the captain turns off the fasten seat belt sign we will be serving dinner!"" We got our meal shortly before 2am - so I arrived in Kathmandu not a bit hungry. There was an empty seat next to me and I had nice leg room as well. There was a screen on the seat and a place to charge my phone! All the flight attendants were just nice.",Promoter
"Singapore to London via Doha. It was my first time on either the A350 or Boeing 787, which to my mind were very similar. Not quite as spacious as Qatar Airways Boeing 777 but pretty good, and better than the A330/340. New seats were comfortable, and much better entertainment system - almost intuitive! Cabin crew service was spot on as always. Qatar Airways are still my airline of choice.",Promoter
"Qatar Airways from London Heathrow to Hong Kong via Doha. It was supposed to be an A380 but the plane was changed. Bizarrely, even though we had booked 9 months previous, my wife and I were allocated seats away from each other. Fortunately we were able to change to adjoining seats. It's not the first time this has happened to us with Qatar. Onboard everything was great as usual, and it was now a Boeing 777, which I think still sets the standard, even though the entertainment system is a bit cluncky. The second leg was an A330 which was either new or had been re-fitted with the new seats and was fine.",Promoter
"Alexandria to Kuwait via Doha. My flight from Alexandria wasn't very enjoyable. We did not have personal IFE, but the food was excellent. The seats were average A320 seats. On arrival to Doha we were brought to the terminal with buses - if you travel in the morning and noon, the airport is really empty at these hours. We arrived in Doha around 5pm. Hamad International Airport in Doha is huge, but its extremely easy to navigate through. We had a 3 hour layover but had to time to eat and buy some souvenirs. Our flight to Kuwait was short, but the Boeing 787 seats are crammed, and I did not like the food. It was a kind of pastry with either chicken or lamb and my pastry wasn't baked properly. On flights under than 1 hour earphones won't be given out. The cabin was clean, but the 3x3x3 configuration wasn't what I was hoping for. On my flight back to Doha, the same pastry was offered and I declined. I don't like the dimmable window shade that Boeing 787 aircraft have - extremely annoying to people trying to sleep at day-time. The flight attendants were grumpy on Kuwait flights. Our layover in Doha wasn't as long as on our inbound trip, but we still had time to grab a burger before proceeding to our gate. The airport was empty (it was noon) but be aware that you have to walk a lot (our gate was C13). On the flight back to Alexandria I had lamb and maybe the chicken option would have been better. On both my flights from and to Alexandria the food included fried vegetables, chicken/lamb, a small salad, and a piece of cake. In March I'm flying with Qatar Airways from Cairo to Oman, and I'm looking forward to their 777 cabin layout. I do suggest that people fly on Qatar Airways, it is much more enjoyable than Turkish Airlines for example.",Passive
"Hong Kong to Copenhagen via Doha return, Xmas and New Year 2015. The product was stable and predictable and almost fully punctual arrivals. Economy class has poorer food and drink choices. No menu provided, 2-3 options of hot meals offered despite small portions. Service onboard was top notch. three of the four flights were full but the cabin staff managed servicing passengers satisfactorily. Transfer in Doha was slightly better (airbridges 3 times out of 4). Recognised as elite FFP flyer and offered a free upgrade between CPH and DOH due to overbooking in economy. However, I was told that I could not use the upgrade offer as I was travelling with a child on a separate booking. Child meals and toys for kids provided to perfection. Seating arranged well and proactively well adjusted as needed by staff due to full flights. The lounges for Oneworld Elite customers in Doha are substandard . Codeshare and cooperation with the Oneworld partners Cathay Airways and Dragonair faultless in terms of booking, miles crediting, luggage transfers.",Promoter
"Singapore to London via Doha was fine except my in-flight entertainment screen seemed to have a mind of its own. The shows that I were watching kept skipping back and forth and stopped as it pleased on its own accord when I was not even touching the screen or the remote control which was annoying. The meals were okay, some of the side dishes had tastes I was not accustomed to. On my trip home from London to Singapore via Doha, the plane from London arrived at Doha late by about half an hour. Because the transit time was only 45 minutes, we missed the connecting flight back to Singapore and the way they handled this could have been improved. Before we started running to the connecting gate, someone could have informed us that there was no point doing so and bring us to the customer service for alternative flights. When a large group of us approached the customer service, some staff seemed flustered and annoyed instead of calming down the passengers politely. When we asked for an alternative flight, they gave us one which leaves Doha 12 hours later. They should not sell connecting flights with such short times.",Passive
London Heathrow to Ho Chi Minh via Doha. We were late departing London Heathrow (Heathrow Airport fault not Qatar Airways) meaning we missed our connecting flight from Doha to Vietnam. Upon arrival at Doha there was a lady there with our names on a board with new flights to Bangkok which left in 30 mins. She escorted us all the way to the plane. Arrival at Bangkok another Qatar Airways employee was waiting to escort us to the Thai Airways flight they'd booked for us. Arrived in Vietnam about an hour later than original planned. 10/10 customer service. Our bags even made the journey.,Promoter
"On December 23, we went on a business trip from Amman to Doha, it was my first time onboard Qatar Airways. In general I was pleased with the flight I got on, the crew were excellent and happy all the time, the seats were comfortable, and the IFE system was good. So all in all, the flight was great. The food could be better for a 5 star airline.",Promoter
"Abu Dhabi to Perth via Doha return. Uncharacteristically chaotic check-in at Abu Dhabi apparently due to an IT glitch. An issue beyond Qatar's control, however there were no airline agents on hand to provide guidance / control the rapidly-growing queue of irate passengers. All flights were on time, the planes spotlessly clean, IFE was fully functioning throughout. I was personally greeted as a frequent flier on each leg, and for the vast majority who use economy, Qatar Airways Boeing 777 remains the best in class for long haul comfort. Alas, hot towels are long gone",Promoter
"Oslo to Dhaka with a 9 hour transit in Doha, and was told if the transit is longer than 8 hours, a hotel will be provided - but they did not provide this. The return flight from Dhaka was through Doha and London, with 3-4 hours transit. The food was excellent in all flights as it normally is on Qatar Airways. Seat was good and the entertainment system was also nice, especially the touchscreen in the A380 is superb. Turkish Airlines is cheaper and I may therefore prefer them next time.",Passive
"Economy class from Singapore to London via Doha. The food was dull, and A350 from Singapore is not impressive, there was a leak from the WC in one of the toilet. The FAs were quite courteous, but were not much better than their competitors. One thing that is quite annoying is that they use a different lounge for One World premium members. They have their own lounge for business class passengers, but lounge in Doha airport that I used as BA gold member is pretty much useless. I would probably recommend Qatar Airways if you can get good price.",Passive
"London to Singapore via Doha with Qatar Airways. All flights on time except SIN-DOH which arrived 20 mins late. Seating on A330 is 2x2x2 which is a problem, but 1x2x1 seating on the other aircraft means greater privacy. Seats are fine and comfortable enough to sleep. Food was good and available on demand, but on the flight from London the English breakfast had run out by the time my order was taken (row 4). If you choose to eat later in the the flight, there may be little chance of your first or second choices being available. Not a good point for business class. My bland meals to/from Singapore were ok, but the salads were poor and one of the soups was anything but bland it seemed to me. AVOD fine with the greatest choice available on the A350, including a tail mounted camera which gives an amazing perspective of flying at high altitude. All crew good, friendly, efficient and welcoming. Certainly the service is up there with some of the best but they should look at improving quantities of certain dishes which are bound to be popular on certain sectors.",Promoter
"Paris to Bangkok via Doha with Qatar Airways. In a word excellent. Business class does not get better than this with regard to service, food, cabin layout and ambiance. The seat was magnificent with controls that got you into the seat or lying position of your choice. I connected with Aer Lingus from Dublin bypassing the more direct option using either Etihad or Emirates. Smart move. I have used both of these airlines in business on a few occasions and although good in themselves come nowhere near the Qatar Airways product for its elegance, comfort and consistency. Being part of the one world alliance is also an added bonus. Rightly the number one airline offering a lounge in Doha that is just unbeatable. I look forward to their arrival some day into the Irish market.",Promoter
"ATH-DOH-BKK return with Qatar Airways. Excellent flights, all on time. Food was probably the best I've had in economy class, always with 3 options on each flight. FAs very polite, with a true smile on their face. The A380 on the DOH-BKK sector, is an experience in itself. Excellent IFE, 3D touch screen TV, 15 mins free wifi and on air network service is a top quality product. QR deserves the 5 star ranking and it will be my only choise for my middle and far east flights.",Promoter
"My flight from SÃ£o Paulo to Singapore via Abu Dhabi with Etihad was cancelled, so I flew SÃ£o Paulo to Singapore connecting in Doha with Qatar Airways. First segment, GRU-DOH was in a Boeing 777-300. Very nice seats, excellent service, meals, beverages, chocolate Valrhona. Arrived punctually at Doha, where I had a 2hr 30min connection for the next flight to Singapore. Next segment was in an A350 : a very new aircraft, very nice decoration and design of the business class cabin (no first class). Service onboard also excellent, nice crew, always ready to help and to offer you what you want. No complains and deserves the 5 stars.",Promoter
"Melbourne to Madrid via Doha. The flights were on time and check in staff very welcoming and efficient. The food was average, service was okay, my headset was broken on one leg and I didn't get a replacement. My main issue was even though at check in I was in an aisle seat, for the longer leg this was changed at the gate and they would not move me again - even though this had happened on my outbound as well within less than a week. I explained my circumstances but the gate person was not interested and was told it was because I was travelling alone.",Detractor

Doha to Oslo red eye flight is operated by Boeing 787. I got an exit seat where two families with small kids were sitting. All night long these kids have cried. So I experienced uncomfortable flight. But nothing the airline can do. Seat pitch was good because of an emergency exit. Very attentive and friendly cabin crew. IFE contained many new movies, musics and games. My flight experience was nice. Would fly with them again.",Promoter
"London to Tokyo Haneda via Doha. As usual it was a pleasure to fly with Qatar Airways, but not perfect. The Business product on the 777 is not the latest, but it is very spacious and so much better than other carriers. Seat was a little hard. My first experience of the Boeing 787 product, which I thought was great, even though at first sight it appears more cramped (I did graze my shin on the TV shelf when trying to get back onto bed). I liked the lav location in the cabin vice galley area. I was surprised that transfer at DOH was worse than at the old airport",Promoter
"Manchester to Kuala Lumpur via Doha with Qatar Airways. This was my first long haul flight in a few years, we arrived very late at the airport and only had a few minutes until check in closed. The Qatar Airways staff were waiting for us as we were the last passengers to check in, we were very short on time and the staff escorted us to the security check and managed to get us fast tracked through security so we didn't miss our flight. We boarded the plane and were greeted by the nicest crew I have encountered on a flight. Our first leg of our flight was roughly 7 hours to Doha. The plane was clean and very stylish throughout each seating class. Shortly after take off we were served breakfast which consisted the most amazing meal on an airline. We were served Waffles with strawberries and cream, We also received a hot bread roll, fruit salad, yogurt, water and fresh juice and coffee. After we were served our meal, the cabin was cleared of the breakfast and we could sit back and relax. The inflight entertainment system was great and had hundreds of movies, TV Shows, music, games to keep you happy for the long flight. A few hours into the flight we were served lunch. The food on this airline is some of best. We landed in Doha with a short 4 hour layover which was just enough to explore Qatar Airways hub airport which is a fantastic place. The flight from Doha to Kuala Lumpur was to the same high standards and we arrived in Kuala Lumpur feeling relaxed and refreshed. The seat pitch was very good and seats were wide, aircraft was clean and all staff were excellent. The best flight I have ever taken.",Promoter
"I traveled Qatar Airways from London to Dubai via Doha for the first time. The prices were comparatively less than Emirates and the stopover was about a hour.

Flew with Qatar Airways from Singapore to Munich via Doha on QR945 and QR059. Boarding was on time and the cabin was very clean. Cabin crews were very friendly and warmly welcomed everyone who boarded. They gave plush toys to some kids who were onboard and smiled at them. Meal service was quick and on time.

Faultless product, good lounges (for premium card holder travellers), especially in Doha and Bangkok. All flights punctual, luggage delivered promptly. Annoying bus transfer from aircraft to terminal in Doha. FA's caring and efficient, even with full flights. Tedious announcements and commercials onboard disturbs the experience. Food and drink service was less, options, smaller portions, less meals (no servings before landing in BKK on this flight). Drinks available throughout however.",Promoter

"Travelled 5-6 December 2015 with Qatar Airways. Small Aircrafts (A321 and A320, respectively). Flights punctual, baggage perfectly transferred. Though small, a decent, lounge access is now provided in Nairobi after a two years break (since the airport fire in 2013). Access provided to the Swissport Aspire lounge which is a 3rd party lounge) for elite travellers. Service onboard by FAs is world class. Food portions diminishing, but 3 still options for dinner/lunch on economy remain. Wines have now been reduced from four choices a month ago till now only two, red or white - both are mediocre though of Chilean provenances. The most annoying are the lengthy bus cattle-transfers at Doha (yes! They are still ongoing as the jet-bridges are far from sufficient). Secondly, endless announcements, advertisements, and even Qatar charity requests on passengers (""Educate a child"", ""support etc.."") disturbs the IFE systems to the extent of it becoming annoying and useless despite the good movies.",Promoter

"London to Bangkok via Doha with Qatar Airways, and very pleased overall - especially with the three of four legs on A380 which I found a great step up beyond what I've seen before. Comfortable and supportive seats and even at 1.84m enough space and so quiet. Service very attentive and polite, all on time and minimal time queuing to board aircraft. Entertainment system, again especially on A380, was excellent. Only great weakness was food - even by airline standards I found it terrible on all four flights - fatty meat, almost nothing green, frequently a stodgy pasty with paste inside referred to as chicken sandwich : not nutritious. Juices also terrible (processed juice drinks)",Promoter
"This is my first trip to Edinburgh with Qatar Airways, this involved four flights in total. The ground service in KL was not good. Kuala Lumpur to Doha was on A330. Since the seat arrangement is 2-4-2, it's no problem for me as I was traveling with my sister. The journey was long but the service was excellent. The cabin crew were really attentive and polite, attending to our needs. On the next flight from Doha to Edinburgh, we boarded the Boeing 787 . The seating arrangement is 3-3-3 so this means we're seated with a stranger. But no matter, we had a good time. The cabin crew for this flight (7+ hours) were even better than the first. Our return flights were smoother, however, the flight crew from Doha to Kuala Lumpur were less friendly, loud, and noisy in the cabin. The food were excellent especially the breakfast and lunch. The snacks though could be improved. I'd rather have a sandwich than the pastry (thick dough) sandwich. Overall, I had a wonderful experience flying with Qatar Airways.",Promoter
"Perth to London via Doha. The seats were comfortable, got a packet with tooth brush, tooth paste and an eye mask. I also got a blanket and pillow. There was enough room for me to stretch my legs out. Good choice of movies and shows. I was disappointed with food, not much of a choice on the menu and didn't have enough for 11 hour flight. One point they were handing out chicken sandwiches but turned out to be a pastry filled with mush. Staff were okay, they weren't smiling. At least 8 hours into the flight, they eventually handed out small bottles of water. But flight was good, no turbulence, smooth landing in Doha. I was looking forward to a flight on the Boeing 787 Dreamliner but they changed it to a Boeing 777-300er. London to Doha I flew the A380. Great aircraft, good legroom for economy, food was sort of the same, except they handed out a decent chocolate bar. Entertainment systems newer than the 777. They were great, I watched a few movies and slept most of the time. Then another smooth landing at Doha. I was impressed of the A380. Another Boeing 777-300ER from Doha to Perth. A kid in front of me pushed his seat back on boarding and cabin crew walked by and did nothing until takeoff. Once we took off, the seat came down again for the whole flight. It was difficult to eat food and watch Tv. This plane, my entertainment system would not respond, couldn't press anything without it glitching.",Passive

"Amsterdam to Bangkok via Doha with Qatar Airways. Excellent flights and lounge at Doha. Boeing 787 and A380 seats are the same. But strangely the IFE on the Boeing was nowhere near as extensive as the A380. My wife ordered a veggie meal and the first flight she asked if she could choose something from the regular menu, as the flight was full the answer was no. No problem - but she only received three courses instead of five. Second sector on A380 she could choose anything. The return sector she cancelled the special meal and it was much more enjoyable. On board champagne has changed since I flew QR back in the Spring. Jaquart was offered in the Business cabin, it was okay but the Taittinger Comtres de Chanpagne in the A380 lounge was much nicer. Aspire lounge used at Amsterdam was okay and better than the BA lounge next door. Overall besides Singapore Airlines, I have yet to experience a better Business class flight. Lesson learnt by my wife, don't order a special meal - plenty of veggie choices on the regular menu.",Promoter
"Clean, fresh and smooth even though the duration of the flight was just 47 mins, every minute of it was totally worth it. I'm impressed with the kind of products offered on this Doha to Dubai shuttle. Nothing more to say, an experience of this would be more than enough of an explanation.",Promoter
"Although the line was long for the check in, it was an interesting experience to fly again on Qatar Airways, this time on a very long flight from New York JFK to Kuala Lumpur via Doha. The flight was extremely full on the first leg from JFK to DOH on the B77W. Qatar Airways have a very modern and young fleet. Service was excellent and the cabin crew were on top form for this full flight. Food was excellent and IFE was amazing. Transit in DOH was two hours and a lot of walking in this ultra-modern airport. Second leg to KUL was on-board the Boeing 777 but not as full as the first leg. Crew were on top form and consistency of service was impeccable. I will fly with them again thanks to their friendly service.",Promoter

"Flying Qatar Airways for the second time because we love the new A350, we were a little disappointed at first that their was an aircraft change from FRA to DOH. Instead of the A350 we flew on the Boeing 777, and the business class seat does not compare to the state-of-the-art cabin in the A350. Nevertheless - service was impeccable and we enjoyed the flight. From Doha to Bangkok and return it was the scheduled A380 with the brand new seats. Flying in business class does not get any better than that. The Sky Lounge Bar on board is quite a plus"". Last leg Doha back to Frankfurt was in the A350 was definitely my favorite! Qatar is truly a 5-star airline!",Promoter
"Flew Qatar Airways from London to Kuala Lumpur and Singapore to London via DOH. Check-in at LHR was very straightforward and quick. Arrived at the gate and was informed I had been upgraded to the upper deck. Had a row to myself up stairs on the A380, which is a great aeroplane and very comfortable. Transit through Doha is very easy and plenty of shopping opportunity to pass the time. Flight to KUL was full but still very comfortable. Operated by a Boeing 777-200LR (A7-BBF) which again was in great condition and very clean. Flew back from Singapore on the A350 (A7-ALE). Didn't find the seats as comfortable as those on the A380 or Boeing 777 to be honest but was great to be on the A350 regardless. Final flight back to London on a Boeing 777-300ER. Had to move from my initial seat (26C) as the entertainment screen was not working. However the reassigned 36C meant I had the whole row to myself. Overall great crews and ground staff. Decent choice of movies and TV to watch. My only suggestion would be to offer 2 meals and not 1 meal.",Promoter
"We had 4 flights with Qatar Airways, booked earlier this year for a special fare. Overall experience is that the aircraft were quite new and looked clean. However on the back of some seats, trays and windows dirt was visible. I found the most comfortable seats were on the B777, they seemed to be a bit wider and had a bit more legroom. The least comfortable seats were on the A380. On the B787 there are IFE boxes underneath the seats reducing footspace quite a bit. The climate inside the aircrafts was most comfortable on the B787 where the air was not as dry. Cabin services were good, with quality food and drinks. Hamad International Airport on the stopover in Doha is spacious and clean, easy to spend 2 to 3 hours there until the connecting flight.",Promoter

Cabin crew were always there to check if you need something. I asked for some sweet wine, they didn't have it but the crew immediately added some soda on it to make it sweet - I felt they are very well trained.

"Qatar Airways deserves the praise it receives. Kathmandu to London Heathrow via Doha leaving KTM on October 30th. The original flight was at 1230 from KTM with connecting flight at 1720 out of DOH to LHR. Whilst trekking in Nepal, the daily flights were consolidated due to fuel problems at KTM with the new flight now at 1610. We were unaware of this and went to check-in at 0930 (along with others who were unaware of the change). Qatar Airways had staff in position, re-booked the whole journey efficiently and found seats on the DOH to LHR flight at 0630 next day - the young man stated that accommodation etc would be supplied at DOH and lunch was also given to us at KTM. All in all a generally pleasant wait ensued. Upon arrival at DOH , the QR transfer/hotel desk needed firm handling as they denied that a hotel was needed, a voucher for a pizza or similar was acceptable and a wait of 11 hours at the airport was ok etc - after meaningful discussions, hotel and dinner was supplied for a number of pax on the consolidated flight and everything was deemed satisfactory. What a shame that QR wasted so much time with tired and fractious pax denying accommodation and food - Kathmandu staff acknowledged the problem and handled the matter with speed, courtesy and efficiency only to have DOH staff cause stress. Well handled by Kathmandu, let down by Doha.",Promoter
"Istanbul to Manila via Doha. Flight to Doha from Istanbul was fine. The seat configuration on this flight was 2x2 in business class and there were 12 business class seats on A321 aircraft. My headset was dysfunctional. After a mundane meal service, I dozed off. We got to Hamad International Airport and proceeded to the Al Mourjan Lounge. The lounge was pretty packed, we were lucky enough to find a table at the restaurant and ordered the fillet steak, disappointing that the steak was overdone. Service was great in the Al Mourjan Lounge. We transferred to the area near the family rooms to take a shower. The lounge staff informed us it was the final call for boarding at our gate so we rushed to find out that boarding haven't commenced yet and there was no separate boarding area for business class. Right after take off, I fell into a slumber. Three hours later, a female cabin crew approached us and asked for our meal preference. I have to commend her for attentively paying attention to what we needed. She was at our beck and call so for that, she deserves proper credits. Cabin crew service was exceptionally five star class. Despite that, they need to step it up when it comes to food selection and quality at lounges and boarding service.",Promoter

"On November 11th my wife and myself were flying on flight QR833 from Bangkok to Doha. The flight departed Bangkok with a slight delay but arrived on time at Doha. The seating in our row 12 was outstanding. The cabin was spotless clean, service very professional and highly motivated. The food and beverage were excellent. Overnight kits from Georgio Armani as well as complimentary pyjamas were provided. The inflight entertainment remote control on one seat didn't work properly at the beginning but the flight attendants got it fixed. The business class was fully booked. Every passenger was asked by the crewmembers at the end of flight about their impressions or if they would like to complain. In our opinion the flight attendants did a great job and couldn't do any better.",Promoter
"I recently flew Bangkok to Dubai via Doha and then to Manchester, returning from London to Bangkok via Doha on Qatar Airways. Three of the longer flight sectors were on the new A380. I prebooked a seat in the upstairs economy zone on all flights, which proved to be a good choice. This zone was small but quiet and very spacious. I thought the seating was one of the best I have been on in Economy class. The staff, food and entertainment were all top notch. Its also a plus to fly via the new airport in Doha, very easy to navigate unlike Dubai.",Promoter
On 24th October we flew Qatar Airways from Frankfurt to Doha. Our seats were located in row 36 on the port side of the aircraft. The A350 aircraft was extremely clean and the seat comfort quite good for economy. The food and beverages served were above standard. The service onboard was at a high level compared to other airlines on this routing. The overall experience pretty good.,Promoter
I use a wheelchair and flew from Berlin to Bangkok via Doha. I did the booking in April 2015 and all seats were confirmed. When I made the web check in my companion got other seats than I. At check in it was not possible to solve the problem. Doha to Bangkok I got other seats. It was not possible to receive my wheelchair in Doha. I had to use an airport wheelchair which was too small. The transfer to my seat was also not very professional with their right equipment. On the way back in BKK I didn't get the confirmed seat. I got a seat (43D A380) with unmoveable armrests and it was difficult to sit down. The food was on both legs the same and the bar service was good.,Passive
"London to Singapore via Doha. Very impressed with the economy service and product offering on Qatar Airways on their brand new A380 and A350 aircraft. Aircraft spotlessly clean on both legs. Seating the same on both aircraft, very comfortable with good legroom and reasonable seat width. Felt more cramped on the A350. Crew professional and friendly on both legs. Good meal services on both flights, although I note on daylight flights in this case London to Doha the meal service and offering is much more extensive than on the early morning flights 0230am from Doha to Singapore. Inflight entertainment good and extensive choice not just of Western movies/tv but content from around the world. The Oryx IFE system they use is not that user friendly and can be clumsy. 15 minutes free wifi offered on both flights, but no point in using as the system times out constantly. Bathrooms kept clean throughout both flights. Only real negatives about experience, very long and drawn out safety announcements done in both Arabic and English but not simultaneously, way too much advertising of Qatar Airways, Qatar banks etc. Inflight entertainment interrupted too many times with charity videos and arrival videos for Doha. The new Doha airport for economy class passengers very bland, very poor food outlet choices, expensive shops, but lack of sitting area, shower and rest facilities for such a major global hub.",Promoter
"Hanoi to Nairobi via Bangkok and Doha. Excellent service at check-in in Noi Bai International Airport. NIA Business Lounge in T2 is very good and spacious. Onboard proactive FAs provide a good mood and proper care. The product has changed slightly in recent months in economy class with smaller food portions though 3 options are offered on menu card. Champagne is not served in economy class but an amenity kit is still provided. Excellent language skills among the crew. All flights on time. Reliability and precision of the airline high. FAs are professional, fresh, and often in a sparkling mood. I never had experienced a significant delay with Qatar Airways, but am annoyed by eternal bus-transfers in Doha. HIA was supposed to have this improved but I do not see much change nor direct gate access. Onboard the worst part is the the slow safety video, lengthy, numerous commercials (esp. on tourism, banking, and HIA glamourisation). Even worse are QR charity initiatives which are imposed on all passengers. Drink rounds have been less on my flights and are no separate round offered prior to meals - which can be delayed for 1-2 hours into the flight",Promoter
"Manila to Istanbul via Doha. This is the first time for us to fly Qatar Airways since we've been flying Cathay Pacific for such a long time. There was barely a queue on business class. I approached a QR staff and asked if she could resolve my FFP issue. She was able to encode CX on the system. At least I was happy that my mileage earnings would be credited to my Marco Polo Account. We were then given our boarding pass and lounge access. We queued for the Immigration Checks, and that took us an hour for us to get through. When we get to the line for one particular immigration officer, there were like 6 people ahead of us and it took her forever to deal with each one of them. When it was our turn, it took less than 5 minutes. We walked like a couple of minutes to get to the PAGS Lounge and it appeared like the old Cathay Pacific Lounge - I was then told learned this was the old CX Lounge which needs a serious revamp! We were welcomed onboard warmly, although disappointed to see the seat configuration was 2-2-2. I was hoping that it was 1-2-1. Service was impeccable - simply impeccable. We preferred to have dinner an hour after take off. And when the meal service was on, I got so delighted with the breads. The Arabian Mezze was spot on and I got the second glass of Australian Shiraz. Unfortunately, the entrÃ©e was mundane. I would prefer a third glass of Shiraz and nuts over the main. Dessert was available, but I opted to get the cheese platter to pair with my Shiraz and it was divine. We touched down at Hamad International Airport at 9.30 in the evening. Deplaned and worked through to the transfer desk for the in-city accommodation which was provided by Qatar Airways. We checked in and were given a room at the top floor, the accommodation was decent. The toiletries were L'Occitane. After a quick shower, we dozed off as the wake up call is at 4am. At 4am, we got the wake up call and checked out. The airport transfer chauffeur took us back to the airport and it was like a breeze going through immigration and security checks. We tried the Qatar Airways Al Mourjan Lounge. When I entered, I got astounded with the sheer opulent details. The high ceiling, the furnishings and all that. Basing everything on In-Flight Service not the seat configuration and design and the whole experience, I would fly Qatar Airways Business class on my next long-haul flight.",Promoter
"I flew Johannesburg to Dubai via Doha return with Qatar Airways. Simply the best airline and deserving of 5 Stars. The Boeing 787 is really a great aircraft in and out of Johannesburg . Being used to flying on bigger jets for long haul, I prefer the smaller long haul jets. Onboard service and amenity kit was impressive for an economy class ticket. Great all round.",Promoter
"Perth to Edinburgh via Doha. Planes modern and spacious, I could see the Boeing 787 could be cramped if full but the large windows and lower cabin pressure make experience better. Very little jet lag on my arrival. Very pleasant flights helped by being able to have three seats to myself on both flights. Staff pleasant if not overly friendly. Food okay on Perth to Doha segment. Breakfast on leaving Doha much better but pastry and savoury snack before landing in Edinburgh not great. Doha Airport good on quiet midweek morning but quite expensive for food and drinks. Onward connection from Edinburgh to Belfast straightforward as bags checked all the way through and just needed to pick up boarding pass from flybe staff. Overall a very easy way to connect to Northern Ireland from Australia.",Passive
"Oslo to Bangkok via Doha. The business class product is still excellent, and the crew was friendly and attentive as usual. Small things are cut back, the amuse bouche from Oslo, drink after takeoff, amenity kit. Still value for money. One thing that annoys is the IFE remote which is sluggish and unresponsive, unless you by chance touch it with your elbow - not very smart placement in the seat. DOH to BKK they do a full dinner menu, very slow on a flight that leaves after midnight. I gave up and went to sleep. Tried the on board lounge for canapÃ©s, but they only had nuts.",Promoter
"Heathrow to Abu Dhabi via Doha in Economy with Qatar Airways. We are Oneworld Ruby card holders so from the time of booking got access to reserving seats which was great. Our first flight was on the A380 so we got seats reserved in the small cabin at the back of the upper deck (only 7 or 8 rows). When we checked our bags we were able to use Business class check in (Oneworld benefit was honoured! However the seats we had chosen months ago were changed when we tried online check in and I could not change them. Frustrating that the agent at the desk could not change this back and we were referred to another desk to the flight supervisor who to be fair despite arguing with me about ""accepting"" those seats when I checked in online, did change them to our original preference. I was grateful for this and thanked her. Onboard the seat on the A380 is really good. Thin seat, but comfortable and plenty of personal space including legroom. The recline is very good, but thankfully for me no one in front other wise it would have been in my face. There's a decent sized IFE screen and a reasonable choice of movies. Despite this cabin only being half full it took about 90 mins before we were offered any service which was lunch. Nice enough, but the entree portion was small, and drinks were offered with the meal almost like an afterthought. Throughout the flight the crew were friendly and responsive if you asked for more drinks, but not proactive. Close to arrival we were served a wrap and muffin which were nice. Transferring at Hamad international was a breeze, you literally walk through a supervised glass door straight back into the departure lounge (it is different on your return). Really nice modern and relatively quiet airport at 7pm local time. For westerners there is nice French themed bar and restaurant that serves alcohol in the departure lounge. The second leg to Abu Dhabi was less than an hour in duration. The seat comfort was fine on the Boeing 777-300 and it had IFE if you wanted it. The crew served a savoury pastry and cake with a cuplet of orange juice. Overall the experience felt good value for money, albeit I wasn't bowled over given the 5 star experience I was expecting. I just think they could have made a massive impact if they'd provided a more proactive service on the upper deck economy section of the A380",Passive
"Flew home from Abu Dhabi to London Heathrow via Doha. First flight on Al Maha branded A320. Check in was fine and like our outbound flights our Oneworld ruby status was honoured and despite travelling in economy we checked in at the business class desk. On board this aircraft the legroom was really tight and I'm glad we only had less than a one hour flight. This Al Maha configuration has no seat back IFE, but this was not a problem as the flight was so short. We were served a savoury pastry and cake and a cuplet of orange juice. We arrived at Hamad International a few minutes early and the transfer process was quick and slick. Handbaggage X-Ray and personal metal detector screening. Relaxing time back in the departure lounge. Boarding was stress free as they do it by seating zone for economy. The seat was comfortable on the Boeing 777-300 and legroom more than adequate for a 7 hour flight. In common with my outbound flight the service was slow, over an hour before any service (we were in the third row of economy cabin). Dinner was nice, but entree portions are small. Drinks only served with dinner. After this you could get more drinks if you asked but the crew were not proactive offering anything other than occasional glasses of water or orange juice. Close to arrival a savoury pastry and cake accompanied by orange juice were served. I'd fly Qatar Airways again at the right price point, but I'm struggling to see why they are rated 5-star.",Passive
"London Heathrow to Bangkok via Doha with Qatar Airways. First flight on Boeing 777, Doha to Bangkok on the A380. Both flights with excellent service and food. Seating on Boeing 777 okay, terrible on A380. My review concerns the latter part of the trip. We were late arriving at DOH - no explanation or apology. So we were then late at the departure gate, where our boarding passes were checked 4 times - with the staff standing in sight of each other - crazy. The seats on the A380 lower deck were cramped and legroom was short. At least one person had their dinner tipped in their lap from inconsiderate 'seat recliners' in front. When the pax in front of me reclined their seat, I couldn't watch my screen. I wear glasses, and with the screen so close to my face I couldn't focus. Sleeping was not comfortable, with my knees jammed against the seat in front (I'm average build, 5'10 height). When are airlines in cramped economy class, going to restrict the amount seats recline?",Passive
"Heathrow to Colombo via Doha. The Qatar Airways lounge at Terminal 4 Heathrow is excellent. We were able to eat a tasty three course meal before take off and then able to bed down as soon as we took off. The small business class only jet to Doha was spacious and comfortable. The airline staff were courteous and attentive. Upon arrival at Doha we whisked into the Lovely Business class lounge and had enough time for a cup of Dilmah tea (Ceylon) before boarding the A340 to Colombo. This second plane was spacious and very comfortable. The new configuration and seats are excellent with lovely flat beds and plenty of room. Staff were outstanding as was service, food and beverages. Our return to London was on another A340 followed by an A380. Both flights also had excellent, attentive staff. Qatar Airways were extremely helpful, polite and accessible at all times. Thanks for making our holiday so enjoyable.",Promoter
"Manchester to Bangkok via Doha return, and a superb trip with Qatar Airways. Check in at Manchester business desk took only a few minutes then on to the Escape lounge which was quite full, perhaps one day Qatar will have their own lounge in Manchester and maybe a complimentary Chauffeur service. Boarded and a member of cabin crew asked about drinks while others introduced themselves, always a nice touch, took off virtually on time. A330 is a nice aircraft, small business class section with comfortable seats, decent selection of movies, food very good as usual on Qatar. Arrived Hamad International a few minutes ahead of time and disembarked into airport, no bus. As I had a few hours to spare went to the Al Mourjan lounge until gate for Bangkok advised. Bangkok flight on the A380, some of the departure gates designed with this aircraft in mind as separate business class gate and upstairs lounge to board direct to upper section. Much bigger business section with 48 seats, very comfortable but strange seats no arm rest of the left hand side until you reclined the seat. Good flight, again managed to sleep for a short time before arriving at Bangkok. Return flights just as good despite an 8 hours transit in Doha (more about that in the lounge review) I always get messed up with the different Airbus A330 models but the one from Doha to Manchester was different from the first flight, looked a little older and smaller. I can't praise the Qatar crews on all four flights enough, brilliant service with maybe the best food on any airline. The only thing that spoilt a perfect trip was that between Bangkok and Manchester my case was damaged in three different areas, it looked like to main damage was done by the wheels of another case.",Promoter

The Boeing 787 from Stockholm to Doha was quiet and smooth and with great service of crew and inflight entertainment. The leg room was ok but the seat width is a little tight, but overall a great flying experience. Doha to Melbourne on the Boeing 777-300 with more space - both legroom and seat width. The crew gave just as good service, made the 13,5hour flight as good as it can possibly get, even my 85year old father didnÂ´t have any complaints.

"London to Shiraz via Doha, returning from Tehran. Qatar Airways 1x2x1 business class layout on the A380 top deck means every seat has aisle access. They are angled away from the aisle to make them more private, have lots of storage space (plus big overhead bins) and are very comfortable. There are two toilets at the front and two at the back and the lounge area (which surprisingly didn't seem to be used much) makes the whole area feel spacious. Passengers in the small economy section at the rear of the top deck are entirely separate and not allowed to use the lounge or wander through the business area. The cabin service and food was faultless. Qatar Airways cabin staff are specifically trained for the A380 and it certainly shows. A nice touch is that each passenger has a designated crew member who introduces him/herself before take off and says goodbye before landing. The A320 has old style business class seats but these were fine for relatively short flights.",Promoter

Staff most attentive and food outstanding.

Check in at Schiphol was quick and polite directed to the Aspire lounge - a 3rd party lounge which is fine although busy. Boarding on time by class, once onboard the service was 2nd to none! The seat on the Boeing 787 (2A) was comfortable a great environment. The crew on this flight I could not fault and neither could I fault the food which was presented well and tasted great.

"My wife and two of our children thoroughly enjoyed all 4 Qatar Airways flights, from Amsterdam to Ho Chi Minh City via Doha. The standard of cuisine and other catering was very high, but they did seem to run out of things early in each flight. Maybe they shouldn't over play dining options and (wonderful) spirit and wine choices. The rose champagne was finished before take off in AMS. Being patriotic I ordered a Glenfiddich as my post departure drink from SGN and there wasn't any. The Meursault wine was finished after one glass out of AMS and SGN. On each occasion I was told they would try to get me my dining options subject to what their colleague had been asked for in the other aisle. I formed the impression that there was calculated stocking of food and using up depleted stocks of their excellent drinks cellar. I spoke to the cabin director on one matter. The business class seat layout of the Boeing 787 is 1x2x1. My wife and I sat in the middle with the children on either side. It was clear we were travelling together but they could not comprehend that my wife and I would want to dine together and insisted that we take service at different times from different crew. Sorted on the last flight after a wee chat. Please don't get me wrong. These are minor gripes about a superb airline with an amazing Business Class facility in Doha.",Promoter

"Tokyo Narita to Stockholm via Doha. At Narita, Qatar Airways ground service is operated by partner Japan Airlines, quick and efficient for check in and luggage. Lounge is comfortable and quiet but food offer is rather poor as often in Japan. Long walk to the gate but we had been warned it would take 10 minutes. Easy boarding, on a Boeing 777, nice welcome by a crew member who showed us to our seats. Same comfort and lie flat bed as on the outward flight. I chose more international food, it was a light dinner due to late departure (10pm), nothing fantastic but good and nice presentation, all dishes brought to your seat, no trolley up and down the aisle. I watched two films. Could sleep well and had ordered a light breakfast which was served 90 mins before landing. Arriving at Doha at 4am, access by jetway but long way to walk, time to walk to the lounge, hardly anybody there, it was 0430 - went upstaors to restaurant which starts at 5am. Could get some tea at once then chose the buffet which I found more attractive than a la carte menu. I had a nice full breakfast out of a large choice of western and oriental style products. Then a shower, no waiting, though lounge was getting more crowded with several flights arriving. 4hr layover went as a breeze, with waiting time in a quiet and comfortable place, with good wifi connection and power socket to charge iphone and ipad. I got boarding information by SMS than on the airport screen so started to move to gate on time as it was very far, 15 minutes walk including moving sidewalks to get there. Boarding by bus, one reserved to business class passengers. Same welcome on board Boeing 787. Crew took orders for meal - chose an arabic breakfast as it was 9am and some extra things such as french pastries. I don't drink alcool and did not watch IFE except the flight route. Twice crew asked if I wanted extra drinks or food. Landing at Stockholm, some walk thru immigration to reach luggage delivery, our cases arrived on belt less than 5 minutes after we had been there. Both flights, as both outbound flights were exactly on time. I was a bit worried with the luggage after reading some comments, but this service deserves full marks - except lounge of airline partners in NRT and ARN.

"First experience on Qatar Airways, flying from Stockholm to Tokyo via Doha. I usually fly Air France but got bored with low quality and tried QR because of special business class offer for flights from Europe. Only negative point was lounge in Stockholm that is small, not that comfortable with very basic food offer. All the rest was great. A brand new Boeing 787 from Stockholm to Doha, day flight, lovely food, nice crew. Arrived in Doha around 5pm, bus transfer, special bus for business, transfer to terminal building took just a few minutes. Doha Airport is huge and we missed direction to the lounge but very helpful staff to show the way. The lounge in Doha was comfortable with large offer for food either downstairs or at restaurant upstairs, lounge was busy, we had 8 hours layover but we found a comfortable place to sit, and rest with excellent wifi connection. Could have a shower without having to wait, nice dinner in restaurant before boarding for Tokyo NRT around 1am. Boeing 777 from DOH to NRT, not so sophisticated seat than on Boeing 787 but somehow more roomy and very comfortable. Both flights with full flat bed. Food on board second flight was great, possible to order anything from the menu anytime. I just had a light treat after take off and chose the Japanese meal before arriving in Tokyo, great Japanese Kaiseki food. Gangway to reach the terminal, some walk , no waiting at immigration, and luggage arrived 5 minutes after we had reached the delivery hall. We could be in the Narita express to Tokyo 45 minutes. I won't comment wines and alcohol either onboard or at the lounge as I do not drink any, and no comment on IFE as I prefer to read or sleep, but their flight info and maps are very sophisticated and I left it on all the way thru.

The flight passed reasonably well until meal time. I was treated to their cooked breakfast on the sector from Doha to London. It might almost have been palatable (ignoring the dreaded chicken sausage), were it not for the fact that I had had that same breakfast on the flight from Bangkok to Doha. They offer snacks on their flights, in this case a Mars bar and crisps, which I found greasy. I was offered a choice of sandwiches : lamb or chicken, but instead found heated pastry parcels containing minced who-knows-what.",Passive
"I recently traveled four long haul flights (London to Bangkok return via Doha) with Qatar Airways, and despite the fact I was both severely lacking sleep and rather hungover on each occasion, I found that each flight was was up there with some of the most pleasant flights I have had the pleasure to be on. I usually fly Business and or First class but on this occasion I had decided to travel to Thailand at extremely short notice (roughly 3 hours), so therefore my business partner accidentally booked tickets in economy. Which is not usually my preference when taking a flight. Yet I could not find fault with the level of service I received on each flight and in particular the flight QR9 from Doha to London, was simply exceptional. I cannot thank the cabin crew of Qatar Airways enough for making what could have easily been a set of nightmare journeys for myself. In the end, amazing. If you are considering booking with Qatar Airways and find yourself somewhat hesitant due to having read some of the bad reviews, I would ask you to consider the fact that when It comes to reviews of anything you can be almost certain that they tend to be completely polarised viewpoints. And as such you should treat them with a pinch of salt. Go with an open mind, you'll probably find your flight just fine. Or allow yourself to enjoy it despite little problems and you might, like me feel the need to write a review because it was such a great experience.",Promoter

This meant we missed our connecting flight at Doha for the onward leg to the Maldives. What made us angry was that our connecting flight was still on the ground at Doha when we landed, but couldn't be held for a short time to allow connecting passengers to board. On arrival we were presented with transfer and hotel vouchers as we disembarked at Doha at 7.30am. We were not allowed to retrieve luggage and were taken by minibus to a hotel on the outskirts of Doha (the Golden Ocean), which seemed like a 2 star hotel. We tried to sleep but this proved impossible as the hotel is situated next to a building site - there was constant drilling and hammering all day long. Not having access to any of our luggage compounded the misery, as we couldn't change into clean clothes. We were collected at 10pm for the flight to the Maldives which departed at 1am. No member of staff apologised at any time - we felt abandoned. We missed 2 nights sleep in a row and arrived at our holiday destination shattered. We spent the holiday fretting about the return journey, as the connection time was a mere 55 minutes, and we dreaded missing it. The final insult was being told our flight from Doha back to London was departing late because it was waiting for some passengers coming in on a delayed flight.",Detractor
"On 18th Sept I was flying Qatar Airways from Bucharest to Doha, and in Doha I was supposed to change the plane and get into another flight of Qatar Airways for Bangalore. The flight from Bucharest got delayed and I missed the connecting flight to Bangalore. However, I am very appreciative about the ground staff of Qatar Airways who took excellent care of me, communicating the reason and making me feel comfortable, while in the meantime they got me a stay arrangement done in Doha, until I had the next available flight to Bangalore, which was the next day. This makes me say 5 Stars to Qatar Airways for excellent customer care. Thanks.",Promoter
"Frankfurt to Doha with Qatar Airways on an A350, with the best and widest ever seats in economy class! Very good service from truly international cabin staff. Easy job, with the aircraft not full. Food was disappointing, a very good Chilean wine and excellent hot, tasty coffee. Extremely nice 3D flight info. The Doha to Colombo flight was on an older Boeing 777 that was disappointing after the A350 flight from Frankfurt. Flight full, not enough staff and seats not so comfortable, with old IFE.     âš‘ Qatar Airways Ranking",Promoter
"Qatar Airways Boeing 777 is better than it's Boeing 787. Despite a little older seats, the cabin layout is much more spacious with a 3x3x3 seat layout. Cabin crew service is adequate, and the inflight entertainment is excellent.",Promoter
"Was looking forward to experience Qatar Airways Boeing 787, but disappointed by the cramped 3-3-3 seat layout. Cabin staff service was adequate and efficient, but maybe not 5 stars. The inflight entertainment on was great. Qatar Airways has competitive pricing, which is something to consider when purchasing a ticket.",Passive
I've been Platinum with Qatar for some years now and Emirates are far better - with better lounges but they don't fly from GYD. The prices in Doha Duty Free often substantially higher than shops in many countries. QR lounges outside of Doha are substandard. There is only one lounge in DOH so if you are flying from a remote gate you have miles to walk. The downstairs gate I used (E26-30 I think) is like a zoo and they expect you to sit and wait till the flight has boarded before putting you on the business class bus.,Promoter
"Scheduled late Qatar Airways departure from Bangkok means we immediately recline and sleep, without food or drink. QR cabins on the Boeing 777 are excellent. Staff friendly, helpful and efficient. Transit at DOH is a joy, with sufficient time to shower and eat a little food in the Business Class lounge. Re-boarding from DOH on the Boeing 787 was more efficient than previously. A little more sleep and modest food consumption near arrival at EDI made for an ideal flight. Excellent experience throughout.",Promoter
"Check-in at EDI much improved on last year. Flight departure on time. Crew on first sector EDI-DOH seemed a bit unco-ordinated on my side of the central aisle. The all day dining concept did not seem to be properly co-ordinated. Food is served, but without wine at the same time. When I requested a glass it never arrived. I consequently left my main course untouched. Although my partner's meal service was better on his side of the aisle, he only received his glass of wine after he had finished eating lunch. Arrival in DOH allowed for sufficient time to shower and have a drink and snacks in the Business Class lounge. Service on the DOH-BKK sector was infinitely better, but as I had opted to sleep, I only ordered a cheese course, and could sleep for the remainder of the flight. Have to mark down based on EDI-DOH staff performance.",Passive
"Qatar Airways flights from Kuala Lumpur to Manchester via Doha. The flight boarding efficient and smooth. AVOD from Kuala Lumpur to Doha was better on this flight than our inbound flight. This flight was full, but there was a lack of drink runs and the food was poor. Flight from Doha to Manchester was also full, the food was slightly better but tasteless. Overall a good flight let down by poor food.",Passive
"CPH-DOH-BKK-HAN on Qatar Airways Boeing 787, A380, and Boeing 777-300 respectively. All aircraft extremely well maintained. All flights on time. Excellent service on all legs despite business class were full in all cases. FA's extremely professional, kind, fit, energetic, and caring, keeping the passengers in focus throughout. Food plenty and creatively cooked, some of the best I have ever had in my life. Even a Danish traditional dish of grilled haddock (Melanogrammus aeglefinus) was made in a sophisticated, tasty way which I initially thought could not work, but QR proved me wrong as it was delicious. My previous trip I rated only 7 out of 10 due to some faults and food and drink limitations. This trip was completely different and as close to perfect as it can be. Thus I have to rate it to the maximum, 10 of 10! Lounge in Doha (Al Mourjan) is very good despite I do not prefer these huge lounges (like factories). In BKK I used the Cathay Pacific Lounge which is simple and small but the lack of choices is not felt as food and drinks are well selected and light. Odd sized luggage arrived well in Hanoi and my luggage came out quickly. Excellent airline, everything functioned to perfection this time.",Promoter
"This was my first time traveling on Qatar Airways, flying New York JFK to Amritsar via Doha. The crew was friendly and attentive. They smiled each time they interacted with me. The seats were comfortable and spacious and movie selection was current, with a great selection. The food was delicious. I've never flown on an airline in which dinner, snack, and breakfast were tasty and satisfying as on this flight. The connecting airport in Doha was huge, clean and impressive with a smooth transfer to my flight to Amritsar. The connecting flight and crew were excellent as well. I had a great 23 hrs flying experience with Qatar Airways. I would use this airline again.",Promoter
"Johannesburg to Stockholm via Doha with Qatar Airways. Great service in business class, and the lie flat seats are truly 180 degrees. A genuine effort from cabin staff to cater for every whim of the customer, from welcome beverage to the 6 course meal with range of wines and spirits. My only niggle was that the AVOD selection for September was not as good as on my previous flights.",Promoter
"Expected a pleasant experience and that's exactly what we got on Qatar Airways during our flights from Manchester to Kuala Lumpur via Doha. The flights were on time, hard working staff, and there were plenty of drink runs through the cabin. The A330 aircraft was older but was well maintained, the second leg on a newer A340 was better. The AVOD not as good as Emirates, the quality and quantity of the food was still good.",Promoter
"Qatar Airways offer a great daily service from Clark Airport, and is one of the few airlines to do so - which is a pity as Clark is a dream to travel from compared to congested NAIA in Manila. Easy check in, I was travelling with my partner and 3 year old son. Sponge Bob toys were offered to my son, and he was a happy flyer. Qatar Airways was adequate in economy but other than the very competitive fare there was nothing I could not put my finger on anything to differentiate in their economy service. The fact they flew from Clark was their stand out point, followed by the very competitive fare.",Passive
"London to Abu Dhabi via Doha on Qatar Airways. They let us use the Business area to check in. Onboard the flight, crew were smiling and respondent. Seats were very comfortable. Finally, they have mood lights, which is a positive. Food was delicious. Transit was around 2 hours. Doha Airport has lots of things to be done in it. Shopping areas to playing, with Macs in the middle of the airport for free. Internet in airport was 15mb/s and upload was 17mb/s.",Promoter
"We recently flew Athens to Perth via Doha on Qatar Airways which was superb. Check in in Athens was quick and friendly. The smaller A320 on the Athens-Doha leg only had recliner seats for this 4 hour flight. Service and quality of food and wine excellent, the seat comfort adequate for 4 hours. The lounge in Doha is very impressive with comfortable seating, good food and drinks. Doha to Perth had a Boeing 777 which was very comfortable. Despite a full cabin the service was top notch and probably one of the best I have experienced. The food is available on demand and beverages of high quality. The flat bed with mattress was very comfortable to sleep on.",Promoter
"HAN-BKK-DOH-CPH in Qatar Airways business class. Threee different aircraft types all fairly new, well-kept, and well-functioning. All flights on time. FA's hardworking, focused, and up to the game. Quality of catering is different, no lunch was served DOH to CPH despite arriving afternoon 2pm. Champagne quality is lower and beers offer 3 options. No cheese or olives offered HAN-BKK. Other sectors the cheese choice was only 3, compared to 5 on previous flights. Eating on demand is a good idea. Too many annoying PA's promoting Qatar as tourist destination, too many commercials/charity commercials made the IFE irritating. Business class was full or fairly full and the cabin attendants did a good job and were caring as usual. Bar on A380 is a scoop but could have bar-chairs.",Passive
"Flew initially on the Boeing 787, the cabin, seat, service and food was excellent. Second leg was on the Boeing 777, service and food was equally as excellent. The Boeing 777 cabin and seat are not as new, but very good compared to other airlines I've flown. Hopefully Qatar will offer a standard product across the fleet in the future. I didn't try the wifi as I don't like paying for it when flying business. Lounge in Edinburgh is okay. Doha business class lounge is like no other lounges I've been in - it's massive, lot of choice of foods, catering to different needs. If you want to sit and eat, you can - if you want quick, light snack, you can - and if you just want sit relax with a drink there is plenty available to do just that.",Promoter

"Kansai to Paris via Doha return on Qatar Airways. All in all, a very good trip and as other people have stated, their catering is much like a restaurant than airline food. Used the new lounge at Doha Airport. No longer a separate building, but the lounge was huge. It must have been the size of ten tennis courts. The A380-800 on both trips and the A330-200 on the outbound trip was excellent. The only complaint is the A330-200 on the way back. The seat was very outdated compared to what we had on the outward flight, although the inflight catering was excellent as always. I think they need to deliver a consistent product.",Promoter
"Check in fast, the lounge in Cape Town is in a partner lounge with 16 other airlines. Boarding okay. Staff okay and pleasant enough although not a full cabin and got my food order wrong twice. Toilet was not properly clean when I used it. Doha transfer a dream, the Al Mourjan lounge is superb. The second leg on a Boeing 787 a total different experience. Fabulous cabin staff who were helpful. They helped me every way.",Passive
"This was the second leg of a flight from Madrid to Bangkok on Qatar Airways. It is Doha to Bangkok, the Boeing 777-300ER which has a 2x2x2 seat configuration in Business Class. My seat was 2A which is a window seat. The is plenty of room in these seats. They have lie flat seats, tons of leg room, storage in front of you, large overhead compartments, cheerful flight attendants, great service. The seat has a large TV monitor where you can watch all kinds of first run movies - over 50 choices. Games, music, plenty to entertain you if you don't want to sleep. It is a night flight, quiet and dark, so easy to sleep. The amenity kit is excellent. They serve a snack and 6 hours later breakfast. The food was ok, beverages the usual, including alcohol. The plane was fairly clean, pillows and blankets are comfortable. The seats have a small, flexible reading light. I don't remember if they have plugs for your phone/computer, but I think they do. All in all, it was very comfortable for a semi-long flight - it is only a little over 6 hours. The best part of being in Business class is when you get off in Bangkok, you get to go through priority immigration and visa! I sped right through. I would definitely recommend Business Class, you get what you pay for.",Promoter
"Qatar Airways evening departure from Melbourne to Doha was on time and hassle free. Boeing 777 cabin very spacious, clean and quiet. Service attentive and friendly without being fawning. Great to have pyjamas and a lie flat bed. Doha Airport has bus transfers to terminal upon arrival, which is mildly annoying. It was a very quick transit time, so got a 20 minute refesh in the lounge, which looked great and was well staffed and serviced. Doha to Athens on an A330. Out of the four legs I had, it was the newest plane, but my least favorite - seating is tight and cabin crowded. Return to Doha from Athens on an A321, which had only angled seats but was more comfortable than A330. Being a 4-hour day flight also helped. Dinner was superb on this leg. Return to Melbourne was on time, and with comfortable lie flat Boeing 777 seats, I got a good nights rest. IFE in general was a bit hit and miss and the Boeing 777 screens were not the best. Overall though, Qatar Airways experience as good as any I have had.",Promoter
"Great service and attention on these Qatar Airways flights and maximum enjoyment in the fantastic bar on the A380. On the route from Doha to Madrid in Boeing 787, noteworthy is the wonderful work of the hostesses. Unbeatable, great care about the menu, the atmosphere in the cabin. Also perfect flight sector on July 31 from Madrid to Doha.",Promoter
"Manchester to Riyadh via Doha. The food was good, seats were as expected, but flights to and from Manchester were full of children (as well as the short Riyadh flights), and sleep was impossible. They use an electronic menu, for which they interrupted the IFE for 30 minutes. Toilets were a mess.",Passive
"I am not a frequent flyer, and itÂ´s mostly short-haul. I wanted a bit of comfort during the flight and I was surprised to see Qatar Airways was the cheapest 1 stop option. The food and beverage selections from Copenhagen to Doha was excellent in a nicely equipped Boeing 787. Crew could have ben a bit more friendly at times. The exact opposite was the case from Doha to Seoul, where the food could have been better, but the crew were excellent and helpful. Seats and legspace were what you would expect from economy, but not too bad either as there was a free seat in our middle row in both legs of the flight. I did not check the Wifi connectivity as I did not want to pay for it. Overall a very pleasant experience.",Promoter
"Checked in online, but drop off check in at Muscat airport could not check my bags to my final destination (Sarajevo on Croatia Airlines flight from Zagreb). This gave me problems at Zagreb, because I was not allowed to collect my bag and check them to Sarajevo, since I did not have a Shengen Visa. Qatar Airways onboard service was good. The flight attendants were pleasant and I had a smooth transfer in Doha.",Promoter
"I am travelling back from a month vacation in Phuket with my wife and two children. When we travelled to Phuket in July we found our six year old daughter had no child meals booked. I had booked this online but it failed to register. The staff were apologetic on the plane and said they would sort the issue for when we returned in four weeks. When we arrived in Phuket we found one of our cases had not arrived. This delayed us at the airport while we had to sort this issue. On checking in online for the return journey we find our family split, with my son 20 rows back from the rest of us on the last sector. The check in staff tried to adjust this but could do nothing better than move him slightly closer. We found our daughter had no child menu on the plane and appeared to be the only one that failed to get a child gift when they were handed out. We asked later and were told all gifts had been handed out. In Doha the airport doesn't have a Priority pass lounge. I know things happen in isolation and cannot be helped, but good customer services should do their best to make it up to their customers by making them feel wanted and needed.",Passive
"Dubai to Kathamandu in J class. The great option with Qatar Airways is that they fly from DWC not DXB which is a superb option. Small airport, you are through from check in to the gate in literally 5 minutes same on the return airside to landside taxi rank. I find Qatar Airways a quality consistent airline, this trip was no different, flights on time, in all directions. DWC to KTM via Doha, staff all pleasant this was a red eye, so sleep was the main requirement but unfortunetly with the aircraft used was not an option. A320 on a 4.5 hour night flight with non flat seats does not make for a comfortable sleep zone. So this was a negative. Crew onboard generally are polite, efficient but have a feeling of being robotic, they don't know how to be personable with passengers. On all sectors there was no priority business check in or priority boarding, all aircraft were at remote stands. Food and beverage good - but fail to understand why Mezze and lamb are on every menu! Overall good but could do better.",Passive
"My first flight from Cairo to Doha was nice, but not amazing. There was no priority boarding for business class from Cairo. The flight attendants were perfunctory with me (a single female student traveling), but lavished attention on the male travelers. When the IFE malfunctioned before takeoff, I was tersely instructed not to touch the remote for 15 minutes, as if it were my fault. Thankfully, the excellent food and drink made up for the service. On arrival in Doha, everything improved. There was a separate waiting area to board the plane to Paris, my flight attendant was amazingly attentive and detail oriented - putting away my carry-on for me, explaining the menu and the seat, and asking me when I wanted to dine, and introducing herself to me by name. When I had my pre-landing meal, another flight attendant observed that I enjoyed my smoothie, and offered me another one, even though he wasn't my assigned flight attendant. That was the service I was expecting when I booked Qatar Airways. The seat and IFE on the A380 was better than any airline I've flown before. All of the Harry Potter, Lord of the Rings movies, and new releases were loaded, in addition to European, Indian, Asian, and Arab film selections.",Promoter
"I flew with Qatar Airways to Bangkok for the first time. Very good, new clean airplane. Pilots talk to you during the flight.

"Trip with small (7 years) daughter. All very good flights, except narrow seats (I was in 10 row, so no problem with seat pitch, but even in window seat - slightly wider than middle - was narrow) in B787 (in B777 much, much better, even A320 was better) and the same children meals both ways from Doha (omelette with some sausage). Normal meal good (especially pancakes). This time no problem with IFE, but on B787 much fewer options than on B777. Very nice Cabin Staff on all 4 flights. Unfortunately in Doha 3 times there was bus to/from airplane but although B777 boarding take long time all flights was almost (one flight was 15 minutes late) on time. Good price. Really recommended.",Promoter
"I've traveled all my life with Turkish Airlines but I have now made my shift to Qatar after the last 2 flights with them: Food is just excellent, good taste and variety. Staff are very friendly, drinks are high quality wines and champagnes. Connection time is very good, boarding is taken care of very well. New Airport is also good and the lounge is first class. The only negative I can add is that Qatar should offer complimentary internet in Business Class.",Promoter
Excellent service on all flights. Some of the flights though were nearly empty (DOH-RGN/RNG-DOH and DOH-MXP) with only around 30% of seats filled. Excellent value for money.,Promoter
"It was my first time flying Qatar Airways. The cabin crew were friendly and efficient, the aircraft was modern and clean with great in-flight entertainment. Seats were of good comfort in economy with great leg room. My flight back to NYC, the customer service at BKK airport was excellent when I needed to pay for extra luggage. I chose Qatar Airways because it was the best fare at the time, now I look forward to flying with them in the future.",Promoter
"Singapore to Doha. Qatar Airways A350 business class is top-notch. A wonderful, quiet and nicely decorated plane. Windows seem to be larger than other aircraft. The seat is maybe a bit narrow but I got the single one which means a lot of privacy for some good rest and sleep. Cabin crew was excellent and so was the food. Restrooms are very nice and were kept clean throughout the entire flight. Have not given a try to onboard WiFi. Anyway, in my opinion this WiFi service should be free of charge for business class passengers. Doha to Venice onboard an older A330-200, but the service and food were just as great as the previous segment. The more I transit through Hamad airport in Doha the more I appreciate its modernity and huge business class lounge.",Promoter
"The business class seating on the Boeing 777 is not as luxurious as newer airplanes such as the A380 - however, it was a good experience overall. The cabin crew members were friendly and offered great service. The seating was comfortable and I was able sleep with no problems. The vegetarian meal was okay. The airport at Doha is big and wonderfully designed.",Passive
"Mu family and I traveled from Saudi Arabia to our homeland, Brazil, on vacation. We are five - myself, husband plus three little ones, aged from 2 to 9 years old. My biggest concern would be to manage the demands of the kids during the long haul flights. To my surprise, not only have I enjoyed the hospitality and services provided by Qatar Airways, but also have my three kids. The entertainment system was great and kept them entertained for long periods of time. Child meal was excellent. And sleeping time was perfect for us, with horizontal reclining seats, operated by the kids themselves. I was able to read a whole book, enjoyed my meals at time of my convenience. My husband enjoyed the trip as much as I did. I would like to register my high appreciation for such friendly cabin crew and ground staff - second to none. Hamad Airport in Doha is a must go one day during anyone's life.",Promoter
"Qatar Airways QR70 from Frankfurt to Doha Hamad International Airport on the new A350. Check-in at Frankfurt Airport was smooth and the Qatar Airways staff were friendly. I had chosen 29A for myself, which was extremely convenient. The cabin was airy and chilly (the way I like!), middle seat was vacant which gave me extra room to enjoy the collection of movies and music on the IFE. A good collection of Hollywood as well as Bollywood movies, and songs encompassing all genres was a treat. The seats looked new and the cabin was very clean. I had ordered a Hindu non-vegetarian meal for myself, which was surprisingly palatable, especially the chicken curry with the coconut base. Service fantastic, I was in the mood for some Ginger Ale, and the stewardess was extremely polite and kind enough to serve it to me within no time. I highly recommend the A350 flight on the FRA-DOH route",Promoter

There was only a panini snack served after departure. . They start with the first meal 2 hours after take-off and the second meal 2.5 hours before landing! I enjoyed the generous luggage allowance and good work of ground service. Not a 5-star experience. There was inconsistency between the flights. DOH-SIN had a paper menu, WAW-DOH an electronic one which was displayed after crew started serving food. WAW-DOH gave no toothbrush, earplugs etc. DOH-SIN had plastic cutlery v metal cutlery for WAW-DOH.",Passive
"We had tickets to fly to Kilimanjaro from Australia on 23rd July and Qatar Airways changed schedules such that we arrive in the afternoon of 24th July instead of the morning. As we had pre-booked a safari and in order to connect to a flight from Doha to Kili, we were compelled to change our arrival time to 22nd July resulting in two additional nights at our expense. The flight was good. Plenty of leg space on the aircraft (economy) and very friendly and helpful staff.

"Edinburgh Airport is a bit of a joke at present. Massive queues breaching out of the entrance with staff not having a clue who is coming and going. The security queues are worse and a bigger joke (being business class I avoided them through FastTrack). Once making my way to the Qatar counter, it was fantastic from there onwards. Check-in of our luggage was smooth, the aircraft departed on time. Seats in the Boeing 787 are at a funny angle but very comfortable and true lie-flat. Meals were well presented and not stodgy. IFE was excellent, perhaps not as good as Emirates. The cabin crew were excellent with attention to detail and sometimes a bit too nice. The Doha business lounge is very good. Not busy and a decent selection of food (although some of it was pretty lukewarm). Boarding onwards to the Singapore flight (again the Boeing 787) was seamless and the FA were again fantastic and dished out pyjamas to sleep in. On arrival, we literally were out within 10 minutes and had our suitcases with a further 10 minutes. Pity Qatar doesnt fly from Glasgow!",Promoter

DOH-JFK was very good. Flight attendants were very attentive. Flight from DOH to JFK was excellent. Food on both legs this time was excellent. Good selection of entertainment provided. I would take Qatar in the future. Compared to US airlines, there is no comparison. The total package of comfort, service, food and entertainment for the price paid can not be beat.",Promoter
"Excellent comfort and food, which is served on demand during the flight. The seat converts into a flat bed at the press of a button. The seat and the pillow was ultra-comfortable. Passengers are given a set of pyjamas for red-eye flight and amenities from Giorgio Armani in a pouch. Service, however, can be improved as it is not consistent. I had to wave to get the attention of the flight attendant as no one had attended to me for more than 5 min after the attendant light was turned on. I also had to remind the flight steward to collect my glass prior to take-off. No one reminded me to stow away my tray table prior to landing.",Promoter

Good breakfast however a family member of mine was informed that they had run out of the breakfast meal she wanted. This was quite disappointing as there were only 6 people in business class and Qatar cannot be known for great food if they run short of them. Other than this, the entertainment system was one of the best, the lighting in the aircraft gave the environment a very comfortable feel and the service was excellent. The attitude of the cabin staff was extremely polite and respectful. Overall, a great experience and hope to travel with them again",Promoter
"Return flight of outward flight 2 weeks ago. What a difference in two weeks. The A340-600 is not a comfortable plane in business, but the food was outstanding, more like a Michelin Restaurant than a plane. The plane A7-AGC, was a little tired, IFE a bit hit and miss. The A330-200 from Clark to Doha had the new business class seats, fully flat unlike the outward journey. The food was excellent again. Has Qatar changed its chefs in the last two weeks. All journeys were on time and both arrived early. The lounge in Doha was fairly quiet, but again great service.",Promoter
"Our flight started with waiting on a bus for over 10 minutes. In our seats (Row 11) the lights were not working. The movies start with long ads, and breakfast chicken sausage was hard. The sink in one of the toilets was blocked.",Passive
"Budapest-Bangkok roundtrip via Doha Hamad International Airport. BUD-DOH with A-321, DOH-BKK with Boeing777 ER, for 2 adult, 1 child and 2 infant the whole trip costs 1706 USD on economy class. The ground services and cabin staff was perfect, the inflight entertainment system worked well, food and the drinks was fine. There was not delays, the check in counters opened 3 hours before the flight. I would be flying with pleasure with them again. I can recommend them.",Promoter
"Great flights - a la carte dining with excellent food. Lovely staff throughout and good comfortable beds when reclined! Transfer easy, lounge was lovely although not well signposted, weird queuing system at bottleneck area near escalators. All in all great and same price as cx premium economy and I got a lot more for my money!",Promoter
"The only less positive comment I can make is at the check-in procedure at the OR Tambo Airport in Johannesburg. Check-in opens quite late, then, having purchased my ticket by Credit Card, an extremely long procedure for verifying the same is initiated, requiring my card and my passport to be taken to the office, while we wait at check-in. Business Class lounge at the airport is quite modest - not at Qatar Airways level. On the plane, everything is positive, from the quality of the seat to the attentive, omnipresent service, to the dinner and breakfast served. Flight on their 787 is exceptionally smooth, one almost regrets that the flight is too short (around 8 hrs).",Promoter
"A few years ago, I took advantage of a special offer from London with Qatar Airways in economy class, and was impressed with the standards of service then. Now that they fly from Edinburgh, I decided to give them another try, and I wasn't disappointed. From the minute we arrived at check-in, we were made to feel welcome. Similarly at boarding, the staff were attentive and wishing people a pleasant flight. On board the Dreamliner, the business cabin is superb. Each lie-flat seat is positioned so that it's like a little personal oasis, and is comfortable, fully adjustable, and with lots of little cubby-holes for your bits and pieces. You're also supplied with rather good noise-cancelling headphones, and an Armani amenity kit. These are waiting for you when you arrive, and they have different packs for male and female passengers. Pre take-off drinks are also served. The service on-board is impeccable - there's one flight attendant for four passengers, and the food is excellent. The menu is extensive and you can choose any items, as and when you please. The plane itself was smooth and quiet, and the attendants ensured that the toilets were always clean and well stocked. Despite a short 45 minute connection time, I was impressed by the new Hamad International airport, where we were whisked through security for our ongoing connection. I would thoroughly recommend Qatar Airways and it will be my airline of choice for future trips, even though Glasgow airport is more convenient for me.",Promoter
"Good flight on first leg. Used the BA lounge in PHL which is underwhelming. Quick boarding and attendant was pleasant and proactive in our cabin. Served a chilled drink and towel and orders taken for lunch. They emphasise the fact that the meals are a la carte which means you can choose when you want to eat. The food was well presented visually but lacked flavour and I had to send back an over cooked chicken dish. There is a good wine selection. The seats on the 772 are spacious and are laid out in a 2-2-2 fashion. IFE was just okay, nothing special. They supply you with pyjamas, slippers, amenity kits and a thin 'mattress', duvet and pillow. I can't fault the service but the planes need a remodel in terms of the seat and configuration. The downside is the washrooms which in my opinion are no different from J class washrooms. The next sector was on an A332. Terrible seats, limited storage areas and no USB port! Again food was well presented but underwhelming in terms of what you pay for. All planes left on time. I would recommend this airline if the price is good for a C class cabin but interiors need upgrading.",Promoter
"First time for my wife and I flying international, so we didn't know what to expect. Qatar Airways made us quite at home for our 20 hour flight. Food was plentiful, even to the point of over eating. We had a delay out of Philly due to rain, and with a short layover in Doha, we did not know if we'd make our connecting flight. Immigration was super fast, and they held the plane for us, though we literally got to the gate with 0 seconds to spare. All but 1 leg of our trip was about sold out, but the flight was not unbearable. We are in the process of booking our return to Phuket for 2016, and Qatar Airways is the airline of choice!",Promoter
"Both routes used the same plane. Service and food was poor out of Manila Clark, but DOH-LHR route food was significantly better. Only issue is that the A330-300 seats are not flat bed like the Boeing 777, very difficult to sleep without feeling you are sliding off. Ground staff were good in Clark and solved a connection issue. Both flights in business about 50% full. IFE was fairly average. No Pyjamas given out and quality of amenities gone down especially the eye mask.",Promoter
"After near perfect flights on the outward sectors to the UK, QR slipped up on the return. Having decided which movie to watch after lunch, not one of the new movies had been loaded onto the 787's IFE system - even 8 days after the start of the month. I then looked at the classical selection of the music channels. These are distinctly second rate in terms of choice - and not all are classical. IFE is one area where QR can definitely improve. Prior to take off on the second flight from Doha to BKK the FA asked about meal choices, reminding me the meal would served on demand as is QR's custom. I made it very clear I wished to sleep as long as possible on the 6 hour flight requesting merely orange juice, coffee and a croissant just prior to descent. We agreed this would be served one hour prior to landing. I was then awakened, raised my chair, threw my eye mask and ear plugs into the side bin as my orange juice was served only to realise there were in fact 2 hours of the flight remaining. The first comment was ""we are arriving early!"" which was not true. The second was that it was assumed I would need time to freshen up! Both inexcusable! On going to the aft toilet to change, the basin was clogged with filthy water and unusable. Then on asking for the complex landing cards required in Bangkok, I was informed they had not been loaded at Doha since they had had no stock for a week. Yet with 4 daily flights to/from BKK, surely the world's best airline could figure out a way to get a stack of them back to Doha!",Passive
"I was looking for an alternative to Etihad, with its high fares and declining service. The extra 2 hours via Doha were not an issue, considering the much lower fare, the great spanking new A350, great service and food and free German rail ticket, which is included in the ticket price.",Promoter
Me and my wife flew from Mumbai on 6th July to New York via Doha. Both ground as well as flight staff were very courteous. All meals served onboard were of a high quality and wholesome. Looking forward to our return journey on 22nd August from New York JFK.,Promoter
"I flew on their Boeing 787 from Cape Town, South Africa to Doha, Qatar. Check-in was quick and easy and we got through security without a hitch. Flight was delayed by 10 minutes because the food was late, but we made up that time during the flight and landed 30 minutes early. The crew was excellent, even with the flight full. Food and drink was kept flowing and was plentiful. Entertainment was excellent as well, seat was a bit small, but I am 6""2. Doha is a beautiful airport and I would definitely recommend Qatar to whoever wants good service, cheap flights and a good time.",Promoter
"This was my return leg to Brussels via Doha on Qatar business class. The first leg was on their 777-300 which after flying out on the 787 and A380 could not be as good, how wrong. The cabin is very spacious and like First class on other airlines. The seat arrangement is 2-2-2 with massive seats, about a metre of leg room/standing space and wide aisles. The seats are much more comfortable, especially in lie-flat than the new seats on the 787, A380 proving that older can be better. The service was excellent and all the staff new our names. There's a free Armani gift for male and female which are placed on the right seats before boarding, a nice touch. The food and drink options are not too impressive but I was quick to order as they ran out of some choices on our outbound flights. The second leg was on the new 787 Dreamliner. The seat arrangement is 1-2-1 but there's not as much room as on the 777 and not as comfortable as I discovered when I tried to sleep, this was an overnight leg. They provide a very thin mattress, a very comfy pillow and a nice blanket if you want to sleep, plus eye cover and earplugs are in your Armani gift set. I skipped the main meal as I'd just eaten in the lounge but I had the breakfast which was nice, with real cappuccino and fresh orange juice. All 4 legs (including my outbound) were on time with good service, overall a good first impression of Qatar after flying several times on Emirates.",Promoter
"Departed BKK on time at 02:40. In flight service was immaculate, superb dinner and wines (3 white and 3 red) served as and when requested, pajamas handed out and flat bed seats as comfortable as any in the air. Doha is a joy for transit passengers who do not have to bother with yet another security check. Lounge is huge with extensive facilities. The second flight was my first on a 787 and I was surprised - I found the experience less enjoyable that the 777. The herring-bone flat bed seat 1-2-1 layout seemed more cramped and I found no advantage in all the hyped up Dreamliner benefits. Still I slept much of the way. Arrived on time! For price, comfort, connections and the joy of not having to cope with Heathrow, Qatar Airways is almost impossible to beat",Promoter
"I recently flew to Bangkok from Brussels via Doha with Qatar in Business class. The main reason was price as they had a genuine buy one get one free companion sale and it was only Â£925 each when it was over Â£1800 from London. Check in was good but they share the British Airways Lounge, I've seen a lot of 1 out of 10's for British Airways on this site so enough said. The first leg was on the Qatar Airways 787 Dreamliner, the seat arrangement is 1-2-1 with only 5 rows so quite exclusive. The seats are cocoon, lie-flat bed style, fully remote controlled, with a big TV, desk, pull-out table, pillow etc and a nice welcome pack of eye cover, ear plugs, lip balm and some nice Armani products. The staff are excellent as to be expected from Qatar Airways but the menu and drinks options were not too impressive. However my wife enjoyed the pink champagne and I enjoyed their signature lime and mint juice pre-flight drinks. The inflight drinks options were limited unless you like wine, lots of wine choice. They don't carry enough of each meal so my wife and I did not get our first choice as we were sat in the back row of 5 they'd ran out! The second leg was on their brand new A380 with business class on the top deck. The seats and arrangement is the same as the 787 just more rows. The icing on the cake and by far the best selling point is the bar. The hostess on bar duty was lovely and made everyone welcome. There was a good choice of drinks and bar snacks, especially the individual carrot cakes. You get a fast pass before landing to avoid the hour long queue at passport control but no free chauffeur service, come on Qatar. Your bags get priority so they're on the carousel before you get there. Overall a good first impression although I was on their newest aircraft, can't wait to fly the new A350.",Promoter
"Effective check-in and transferring. Cabin crew attentive and friendly. Very limited legroom, making the flight really uncomfortable when the flight is full as was the case on the BCN-DOH leg. I am a regular flyer and have found the legroom on all four flights to be exceptionally limited compared to other airlines. Serving of meals on the first two legs seemed disorganized. I was served my meal only two hours after the meal service started. On the second leg I received my meal relatively quickly, but the passengers sitting five rows ahead of me were only served about an hour later. I could not figure out the logic. Serving of meals on the return flights were well organized though.",Passive
"Flew from Doha to London on QR 003, June 24th. Very impressive check in area. Al Mourjan Lounge offered an a la carte options as well as buffet. However, all the menus were based on egg options during the breakfast. It was below what I expected. Qatar should have provided extensive options to their premium passengers based on the fact that these are passengers who are transitting through Doha and have travelled from all over the world within a 24hrs time zone. On baord service was excellent. You can choose your own time to be served. Compliments to the crew and purser who addressed every single customer by name. The seats lacked privacy and were not comfortable for sleeping. It was very narrow and my knees kept hitting the tray table everytime I tried to move to a different position. The same type of seats are also offered on their B787 and A350 aircarft. It was fine for a day flight, and also for lounging and working, but I would avoid this type of seats for a night flight. I had the best sleeping experience on their B777 aircarft. IFE system was ok. Menu options were limited and the quantity are so small. Onboard lounge served Krug Champagne even for JC passengers. However, things which are lacking on Qatar Airways for their FC and JC passengers are, the free limousine, free wifi on A380, and the extensive menu options both at their Al Mourjan Lounge and on board the aircarft compare to their comppetitor, Emirates. However, I would still choose to fly on Qatar Airways since they are a member of One World Alliance and based on their on board service experienced.",Promoter
"I have to say that Qatar airways lounge at LHR is out of this world, the food is 5 star. The food and drinks on the flights were excellent, the crew could not do enough for me. I only had a very brief visit to their lounge in Doha, but what I saw was very good, my only gripe was that they used buses to and from the planes on both flights in Doha. Qatar Airways London assured that airbridges would be used, especially as they now had a brand new airport, so it looks as if they haven't been informed about them still using buses or they don't want to tell you. As I am 82 years old I find it difficult walking up and down those stairs carrying two cases. Hopefully on my return flight in September, they will use airbridges , I'll have to wait and see. Except for that minor thing, I would have given them 10/10, but I can only give them a 8/10",Promoter
"Was curious to try Qatar, having flown Emirates numerous times between S Africa and Europe. Qatar's pricing is a major draw-card, they were significantly cheaper than Emirates. The trip out of JNB to DOH was great, the plane was not full and a lot of passengers had spare seats around them. Not sure that it would have been as pleasant with a full plane. Having heard so much about the Boeing 787, I was expecting it to be state-of-the-art flying, but I can't say that was the case. The seats are as hard and very cramped - these seats rate very poorly against the Boeing 777, and the only way I could grab any sleep was by sleeping against the window. The food was really good, and I love the containers they use - much better than any other airline I have flown with recently. Entertainment is great - the range is not quite as extensive as Emirates or BA, but streets ahead of Turkish Airlines. One gripe is that the crew would only serve one drink with dinner, I couldn't have a pre-dinner drink and a glass of wine. Thought that was rather mean. The flight between Doha and Istanbul was also good, despite it being a full flight on a narrow body aircraft. Return flight was great too, my only gripe is that every leg of the journey entailed a bus to get to the terminal building, and another back out. That would be okay if you weren't left in the 38 degree heat. Other than that, I can't fault Qatar.",Promoter
"Flew from Amsterdam to Bangkok via Doha. I took advantage of a great introduction fare as this is a new route for QR. From and to AMS is with the Dreamliner. The flight to and from BKK with the Boeing 777-300ER. Qatar Airways provides a good service in economy, all flights were on time and the transit at the new Doha airport was painless. They have to work on their inflight entertainment system though, as it is a rather clumsy and unresponsive design. That was really the only issue, for the rest inflight service was good. Some reviewers complain about the limited legroom and uncomfortable seats on the dreamliner but I found both to be adequate. As long as Qatar Airways offer competitive fares they will be on my shortlist for trips to Asia.",Promoter
"Overall flights punctual, staff super friendly. Flights good, Boeing 787 a great aircraft, food ok, lamb which I don't like. Why when transiting do you have to back through security again? Lounge very flashy and impressive but service slow to non existent. I not change the reservation online, called Johannesburg call centre again can't change, tried calling Doha told to do it at the airport. Ticketing at airport again no chance. J class ticket ? Overall I like the crew in the air, but will think again if the food and ground ops are ongoing.",Passive
"Arrived for check in slightly late - large queue so Business desk was opened for me - very friendly check in staff at LHR. Enjoyable flight on Qatar Airways, friendly staff and good service. A drink not long after departure, drink with the meal and a post dinner drink (including good quality Armagnac) plus drinks on request. Champagne was offered in economy - not the most common offering and a welcome change from other airlines who often only offer red/white wine and beer for economy passengers. Comfortable seats with a good range of English, International, Arabic programmes meant the flight was more than tolerable. Food a little highly salted - offerings were chicken/beef with rice/potatoes, nothing ground breaking but nothing to complain about either. Only negative was that like most Gulf airlines it's lacks character - something I enjoy when flying with flag carriers.",Promoter
"After a wonderful flight on a B777-300ER this was a bit of a downgrade I must admit, smaller seats and awful quality VOD. However food and drink service was solid. Cabin crew a little less friendly than the previous flight and facilities more dated, but more than tolerable. Good selection of drinks - spirits and champagne in economy again. Far from the worst but not the best.",Passive
"The plane was boarded well in time however the computers had to be rebooted and the flight left 10 minutes late but time was made up anyway. Keeping in mind that Qatar Airways has been voted #1 in the world it is hard to find fault with anything. My only comment would be that over 5 hours is a long way to fly in a narrow body jet. Transiting Doha is now much better with the new terminal. And even better if you have a silver card as you get access to a lounge in Entebbe and Doha. And for most sectors out of Entebbe (Uganda) Qatar offer the best price, which makes them unbeatable really unless you want a direct flight to Western Europe.",Promoter
"Flew the A380. Boarding was very efficiÃ«nt and shortly after take off drinks and meals were served. So there was enough time to sleep for the remaining flight time. I decided to get a last drink in the lounge. There I had a wonderful reception by the crew, who were nice to chat and pamper for the rest of the remaining flight. I did not sleep a wink, but had my best flight experience ever! Qatar Airways serves an outstanding business class product with incredible good seats and the lounge on the A380 as an absolute extra, but at the end of the day it are the people who are working for Qatar, who make it a 6 star rating.",Promoter
"Dallas to Doha economy class, and passengers were mostly not beef eaters, but one of the main dishes offered was beef. Maybe the airline should look at other food choice options. Overall very satisfied with the service provided by crew and the inflight entertainment. Qatar deserves to be the world best airline. Meal options are not the fault of crew, but just a suggestion.",Passive
"My second trip with Qatar Airways, last time had the older A330 aircraft. What a difference this time! The B787 seats are not as good as A380, but okay for the shorter flight to Doha. The window shades in this 787 aircraft are rubbish, and they do not block out the sun as was promised when Boeing were advertising the benefits of the plane. The A380 was so much better, nice and spacious and seats very comfortable. IFE is not very different to Emirates or Singapore Airlines that I flew last time, don't understand why everyone raves about Emirates because they just have a huge library of ancient, 2nd rate films. Food was good, not the best but certainly good for Economy cabin trip. Cabin staff were great on both flights, better for DOH-BKK where they were chatty and friendly. Return in 10 days flying out of Singapore and looking forward to getting on their A350 I have read so much about. Definitely recommend Qatar Airways with these new planes, and service seems to have improved from before.",Promoter
"Singapore to Miami. The Boeing 787 seats appear good for children and small females but an adult male will be uncomfortable. The first thing to do is relocate the Media box away from the under seat area. Having my one foot out in the isle was not only a safety hazard but not fun to be kicked and bumped into because I could not move my feet if placed under the seat. I was sitting next to a larger man who encroached into my seat space. I believe the seat is about 17"" across. Seat pitch minimal but no different to other airlines. Service was very friendly, top notch. Noticeably better than US airlines. Food was disappointing. While the airline does offer superb service, I recommend against flying them in coach due to seat restrictions.",Detractor
This was a mix of business and economy. Business class SIN to DOH and Economy class thereafter. I was a little disappointed I wasn't able to have a pre-departure glass of Champagne due to customs regulations at Singapore. Once in the air I was able to enjoy a glass. The usual business class service from Qatar Airways was enjoyable even though the flight was bumpy all the way from SIN to DOH. The flatbed was comfortable and a sleepsuit was provided. Back in economy class for DOH to LHR leg. Nice service and the flight was empty so I was able to enjoy a row of seats to myself even if the IFE box was does restrict legroom.,Promoter
"I choose this route so I could fly the A350. The first sector was cramped on the B787 but the service and entertainment onboard was up to the usual standard for Qatar Airways. Once onboard the A350 the leg room and width of the seat was obvious. I was able to stretch out, without irritating my neighbour. The food portions in economy have shrunk but they're enough to keep you going on both these sectors which are just over 7 hours each. The entertainment system on the A350 is also superior to all the others in their fleet.",Promoter
"KUL-DOH-PHL-BWI. The A330-200 KUL-DOH outdated with angled flat seats. Staff were pleasant but perfunctory. Food was reasonable, the wine list impressive and chocolates given out after dessert and coffee. Boeing 772LR from DOH to PHL was much better, more spacious and better seat width. Catering was on demand and staff were warmer this time around and did their job splendidly, although they should chill champagne and white wine properly. The attendant laid out the flat bed on the 772 and provided all passengers with PJ's, a comfy pillow and a duvet. On all flights, the toilets were kept clean, food was served warm, good brewed coffee served and the in flight entertainment was adequate. Great multinational crew which is a plus with this airline. I would highly recommend this airline.",Promoter
"I had high expectations, but at the end of the day all 4 flights were just average. Seat comfort more or less like everywhere. Ground service in Doha friendly but not interested. Crew on board was always friendly. Food was nothing to remember. Stopover in the middle of the night at Doha Airport and arrival to Abu Dhabi at 03.55 is also nothing too fancy. All in all: an on time, average economy experience.",Passive
"TIF DOH BKK, 10th June - Qatar remains my favorite airline and is way above the rest. TIF-DOH First class. I told the flight attendant what I wanted to eat from the menu where items required a choice, assuming that the rest of the menu would follow but all I got was I had selected from that section none of the other items came. The lounge in Doha is large and somewhat impersonal but excellent nevertheless. DOH-BKK Business Class, the crew apart seemed disinterested. Some passengers had finished their meal before others had started. I guess what niggled me not being on the receiving end of top priority as I usually am. All in all OK service and flight. But Qatar normally is above OK and exceptional. I put it down to a bad day for both them and me.",Promoter
"First time traveller on Qatar Airways. We travelled in the business class cabin and as a frequent business class BA flyer I was amazed! It was much better than British Airways and cheaper! The seats are very comfortable with plenty of space and storage space. The TV was big and HD. The choice of films, TV, games and music is very good. The food choice and quality was really good. It was middle eastern based and included appetisers, starters, mains, deserts and a choice of breads. All in all we were so impressed. the stewardesses were attentive, polite and efficient. We will definitely be flying Qatar Airways again!",Promoter
"Overall our experience was decent however there were a few things that put a damper on experience. From Athens to Doha my husbands screen didn't work and only towards the end of flight did the air hostess offer for him to change seats. She kept on forgetting to help and by then he had cut losses and tried to sleep. We also had a 10 hour stopover. All my family who have had long stopovers had been given complimentary hotel rooms. For this reason we decided to book on Qatar. As the time got closer I mailed to ask about this, the staff replies were short, rude and unhelpful. The told me all the places we could pay to stay at, which we had not budgeted for. So we had a horrid stopover at airport. Second time using Qatar and this will be my last. With that said their South African office was friendly and nice.",Passive
"Flew 5 June and back from CPH on 13 June routing HAN-BKK-DOH-CPH-DOH-BKK. HAN-BKK in B777-200. BKK-DOH in A380. DOH-CPH in B787. Excellent experience throughout. All flights on time. Staff alert, attentive and productive. Service and drinks world top class. Food amount and quality is significantly slipping but still acceptable. Because QR has recently done a lot of promotional sales, business class cabins are now full or almost full. However, service was still exhibited well and focused. I rate the B777-200 business class seat and cabin comfort high. However, the best seat and cabin among the 3 aircrafts tried was the A380: almost noiseless and with the luxury bar on the upper deck. FA tend not to chat with each other and keep themselves busy making a true effort comforting the pax â€“ they are friendly and talk positively with most passengers. That's the way! Of all sectors above only the DOH-CPH was in economy, of course a different ballgame with a slimmer hardware and software - but altogether the rating became equally high. Worst on the 787 is the extreme compacted seating which must be among the heaviest packed economy in the world â€“ not much dreaming on that part of the Dreamliner, now I understand the nickname â€œNightmare-linerâ€: If the person in front of you reclines you are forced to do the same unless you close your tray-table! In contrast, the following sector back from CPH-DOH was in the Dreamliner aircraft's business class which offered a superb odysse, but still a bit below that of QR's A380. Business class full but staff managed very well, high degree of attention and service. Al Mourjan lounge in DOH clearly 5 star, though too big to my taste. Lots of food in either buffets, a la carte. The bar on 1st floor offered 3 different, prestigious champagnes (I just checked and saw the bottles). From DOH-BKK in A380: faultless, quiet, lots of service and talkative FA's. I could have all 3 options of hot meals, but limited myself to vegetarian and chicken. Quality of food deteriorates a bit. Slept well. Ground-staff assisted me catching my next flight on a difficult time-constrained connection by a Low Cost Carrier, though actually not QR's problem. Thanks, QR!",Promoter
"MEL-DOH-BAH. The journey back to Bahrain from Melbourne was an awful experience. Flight QR905, June 6th was delayed 45 mins. Ground staff at the gate were not sure what was going on and it seemed organized chaos as a lot of passengers were complaining quite profusely. There was no specific lane for business class passengers to board, something that was quite obvious on my trip through Hamad Airport going to Melbourne on QA904 on the 21st May. Problems start on QA905, once in the air on a 14 hr flight you want to relax and have creature comforts. It involves the inflight entertainment system. I started watching a movie once we had taken off after the 45min delay. A passengers IFE was not working so the chief steward was trying to help fix it but sadly he did not inform others that he was going to shut down the IFE for a reboot. My screen suddenly went off as it did for a number of other passengers. This rebooting was tried 3 times then the chief steward just said we can't fix the problem. This is unacceptable in my book, no portable DVD players were available like you have on Gulf Air, Singapore Airlines and Silk Air as a back up. The system is very fragile indeed and many headphones were not working or only working in one ear. I had to change out 2 headphones to get to hear proper sounds. The next flight 7th June, Doha - Bahrain on QR1121 was just as bad. 55 minutes delay and gate C-28 was just utter chaos. Appalling organization by Qatar ground staff at this gate who again were not that customer friendly. The special lane for business class passengers was not even open and we were lumped in with everyone else. The next time I travel to Melbourne I shall not be using Qatar.",Detractor

Entertainment onboard were nice, responsive and easy to navigate (It surely great for Indian pax, as it has a lot of Indian contents!). Inflight connectivity works. Cabin service were superb.

The aircraft was new, with a great entertainment system, big screen in each seat, many options of movies, series, tv shows, musics, etc. The seat had a good pitch and it was comfortable to sleep.

Some attendants were serious and unfriendly and we had many interruptions with cabin calls and advertising, it stopped the movie I was watching many times. I will fly with Qatar Airways more times for certain.",Promoter
"On 3 out of 4 occasions bussed to plane at Doha rather than using airbridge. This is difficult to comprehend at the huge new Hamad airport. Delayed departure from Abu Dhabi meant late arrival and fear of missing connection. Had to run miles with inaccurate information on airport departure boards indicating flight was boarding when in fact it was delayed. Seat pitch seemed tight. No hot towels or menu cards, although the menu was shown onscreen through the inflight entertainment system. Meal was tasty enough but small portion sizes. Good selection of drinks, with free champagne (in economy).",Passive
"I am not normally a Business Class traveller but I got an amazing deal on Qatar Airways. So of course, I am ready and willing to be impressed. However, this was the most comfortable flight I have had. Attentive service from the flight attendants and a very comfortable and easy to operate seat. The B787 is in a class of its own.",Promoter
"We had a 1 hour 30 minute transit and prior to this flight I was worried about missing the connecting flight or that our luggage would be left behind because of the short transit, but everything went well. Our flight Zagreb left on time, arrived Doha early and we left to Dubai just on time too! On our flight to Dubai the boarding was quick and easy. Flight was comfortable and food on board was yummy. The only downside to this was that, for our flight from Doha to Dubai, we weren't given any headsets for the inflight entertainment. I assume this could be due to the short flight duration.",Promoter
"IAD-DOH, QR708, business class seat 6A. Check-in chaotic after a big storm in Washington which flooded the airports internal train and tunnel system, so all passengers for all flights put on Dulles' dreaded 'people movers'. Flight had 60 wheelchair passengers comprised mostly of those who think they get through security faster if being pushed around. FAs call these ones the 'miracle passengers' who then gamely run off the plane on arrival to get through immigration and customs. Other airlines that have started charging for wheelchair use without a medical certificate find that requests for wheelchairs drops about 90 percent. Full business cabin. Service and catering excellent. Made up time en route for late departure and landed in DOH almost on schedule.",Promoter
"IAD-DOH-CMB-DOH-IAD, Business Class in B777-300ER. Check-in excellent at IAD, followed-by the use of the Virgin Clubhouse. Virgin reception staff rather uptight, but the dining area staff was outstanding. All four flight segments were not full, so I had an empty seat next to me at all times. This is a huge benefit, as although the seat has an outstanding pitch, is wide and very comfortable, it dates back to business class seating of a decade ago, with zero privacy between seats if you are travelling alone. A small bottle of water and a nice Georgio Amani amenity kit was awaiting my arrival, with a blanket, pillow and noise-cancelling headphones. Pyjamas and slippers were given out later on the segments to/from IAD. Staff service was very good on all segments and dine when you want service was good, though cutbacks are very evident in their menus. Of the four flight segments, QR 707 from DOH to IAD on 01 June had excellent crew serving the rear business class cabin where I was. Transit time was short at DOH, but the airport does not function logically, despite its showy architecture. Certainly no match for SIN and HKG. Check-in at CMB was efficient, and I used the UL Serendib Lounge due to my OW Emerald Tier status. Mid-week QR fare was very competitive, and provided very good value for money. Baggage delivery at IAD was much delayed, though probably not QR's fault. Will definitely use them again, especially as they are a OW member airline.",Promoter
"Flew LHR to AUH via DOH return. Outbound on the 787,flight was full. Very claustrophobic, tiny seats, the service took forever. Flight left at 2130, it was nearly 3 hours later that I finally got a drink and something to eat. The meal was cold and when I pressed the call bell to try and get someone to heat my meal, I was ignored. Cannot believe on this evidence they are a 5 star airline. However coming back on QR5, it was like flying a completely different airline - friendly cabin crew, nice food, good service. Maybe it helped that the flight was half empty but what a difference. A330 a much nicer experience than the Dreamliner, wider seats, more legroom and just more comfortable. Doha airport in the afternoon was practically deserted, this is obviously a good time to depart.",Passive
"Milan-Doha on Airbus A330-300 and Doha-Guangzhou on B777-300. In my opinion, this is the best business class product out there on the market. Everything was perfect on both flights: tasty food (excellent presentation), excellent champagne. The dine anytime service is much appreciated. The seat, especially on the B777, is comfy. Very good amenity kit from Armani, the best noise cancelling headphones I have experienced on a plane. Entertainment system is good, even tho the choice of movies on the Milan-Doha segment was maybe too limited. What makes QR a 5-star airline is the cabin crew: extremely polite, friendly, smiling, very well groomed. As a Privilege club member, I was recognized by name on both sectors. Hamad International airport business lounge, huge but still crowded, is quite impressive. I do look forward to flying the A350 business product on my way back.",Promoter
"This review is based on the B787 Singapore-Doha-Johannesburg vv flights and I suspect would be better with different aircraft. As others have commented, the B787 as fitted by QR is a major problem because of hard, narrow and just plain uncomfortable seats, which really is unacceptable for flights of seven to eight hours. This is such an issue as to overshadow other generally satisfactory aspects. I might fly QR again but not on their 787s.",Detractor
"MEL-DOH-LHR-DOH-MEL, 777-300ER and A380. 4 flights and a mix of experiences. Qantas lounge in Melbourne is a dark dungeon and not particularly worth the visit. Boarding was pain free although cabin crew were not well versed when it came to assisting parents with two young children. In most cases on all flights I found all cabin crew friendly but unable to take the initiative to offer services. in most cases if you wanted something you had to ask instead of being offered. These were not lazy crew, they worked hard but they were just not polished crew used to premium service. First of the two business class cabins is the better of the cabins as it feels more spacious and open. Seats are lay flat and comfortable. Inflight entertainment is lacking with random titles from the 80's and not much more if you select the Hollywood option. Hamad Intl is great and the lounge is huge and fantastic. No one explains the options available to you and your left wondering what's on offer. Great flights and great lounges in Doha and London. Food is exceptional bit staff need more training though not because they disgruntled. One incident did concern me though. The A380 has a inflight bar which on one flight was serving up excessive amounts of alcohol to two passengers who subsequently were almost restrained in their seats by crew. Cabin crew really should have stopped serving the two passengers hours before. The only major issue on an otherwise great trip.",Passive
"For someone who has become used to the standard European business class long haul (BA/Lufthansa etc), these middle eastern airlines are quite a revelation. Much like the Cathay Pacific's of the worlds, these guys put the staid overpriced tiredness of the European airlines in perspective. Business class on Qatar is, for example, certainly more than the equivalence of BA's first class. And at significant cost reductions. Part of it is the staff, you just don't get the level of service orientation on European airlines like BA and Lufthansa. Its like there is no motivation to go beyond the standard, drummed in training they've done a hundred times. You know those adverts where you see the service crew gently put a blanket on a sleeping guest? I had assumed that was rubbish, it had never happened to me. Well it did with Qatar! One of the staff even made a personal plan to get an out of stock duty free item to me! Unreal stuff. Or maybe this is how it should be? And long may it last, I hope these guys continue to put pressure on the old hens of the sky like BA and Lufthansa - the competition can only be good for the passengers. Now if the transit times weren't there these guys would be the only ones I'd fly.",Promoter
"4 flight sectors altogether: SIN-DOH-LHR on 5 May CDG-DOH-SIN on 21/22 May. SIN-DOH-SIN were on 787 DOH-LHR and CDG-DOH were on A380. A journey of contrasts between the excellent A380 and nightmare 787 which led to an average rating. For all 4 flights the in-flight entertainment were new advanced and top-notch though slightly laggy. USB ports were available for charging of equipment. The food was decent though the main meal servings were small. For snacks what they called sandwiches were actually (very oily) wraps with a small slice of cake. Service was also average (not as friendly as I'd expect though I must pity them because they sometimes had to deal with a tough crowd of fliers) and can be inconsistent across flights and even within a flight. For instance different kinds of snacks served sometimes a paper menu is used while other times it isn't. That said I appreciate the free amenity kit for the red-eye flights. The booking website was also a pain to use sometimes with outdated information or links that failed to work. New Doha airport which serves as QR's hub - looks new but unfortunately isn't customer-oriented. Now to the specific flight sectors / planes. The A380 is newer and very spacious with comfortable seat pitch and seat width. I will definitely fly their A380 again. The 787 ""Dreamliner however belies its ""dream"" qualities: I did not feel the narrower seat width until I had a man next to me poke his elbows into my ribs for hours while using a laptop on the DOH-SIN leg. I never felt this uncomfortable on a long-haul flight before. For the DOH-LHR leg I was ""upgraded"" to upper deck economy class due to a full flight and as I was a (rival) BA Avios member. Such seats are unavailable for normal reservation except for QR FFP members. That said I was a little unhappy with being ""upgraded"" to a seat without a window which I had originally reserved and requested. Overall I might fly QR again if the price and timing is right for in general they have performed above-average. Potential deterrent factors would include their 787 their buggy website and Doha airport (woe betide anyone with a long layover).",Passive
I flew to Thailand for my honeymoon with Qatar from Manchester to Doha and then on to Bangkok with the same transfer coming home. I have always dreaded long haul flights and never expected what I got with Qatar. It was excellent. Staff were lovely the plane was stunning and the flight was an enjoyable part of our holiday. I can't thank them enough. Due to the previous days wedding and traffic we were 15 minutes late for check in but they took care of us and rushed us on to the plane. I can't thank the staff enough but I will endeavour to make sure our next holiday destination is on a Qatar Plane.,Promoter
24 May LHR-DOH (010) DOH-DXB (1014). 29 May DXB-DOH (1023) DOH-LHR(005). Will keep this simple and say the 4 flights we had with Qatar Airways last week were the best 4 I've had or at least right near the very top (the first one LHR-DOH was unquestionably our best). All 4 flights left on time on the 2 long ones we got constant service on drinks and as well as the meal got 3 other food portions all of which were very nice. On the short 45 mins flight from Doha to Dubai we got a nice sandwich and cake with drinks was very satisfactory and wouldn't have wanted more. The service from the staff was excellent not just on the plane but at the airport all of them were very polite. The inflight entertainment was brilliant with a huge choice of recent releases TV shows etc. The toilets were clean and well kept. The only bug bear would probably be the box below the window seat which limits legroom I had no problem with it but I would imagine that some people might. Overall I enjoyed all the flights and would opt to choose them again next time.,Promoter
LHR-DOH-CPT-DOH-LHR QR004/QR1369/QR1370/QR009. My first time on Qatar however I've flown on average once a month over the previous 15 years mainly on the same 5 or 6 airlines premium or business with a few economy and first flights in between. I no longer travel for work longer interested in frequent flier miles or status either so looking forward to trying different airlines on my 3 or 4 holiday trips each year. Check in at T4 quick with seats honoured was able to use the sky team lounge through my FFP status - nice lounge. Boarding the new A380 was quick and organised seated upper deck I was impressed by the space seat and general ambience the best economy I've travelled in. Take off on time a very nice crew kept busy! Drinks and dinner offered. Dinner just ok connection in Doha went fine. Flights between DOH - CPT and return on new 787's I found the 787 noisy and not as comfortable as the A380 both flights on time again pretty good service from nice crews although food not that good. Had a longer connection in Doha on the return trip so gave me a chance to experience the new airport and business lounge which were very nice. Doha back to LHR on an ageing A340-600 which I found comfortable for the 6hr 20min flight!! crew fine food not that good however for the price paid I really cant complain some of the best economy flights I've had I'm looking forward to using Qatar business in around 2 months.,Promoter
23 and 28 May 2015: HAN-BKK (Business Class) and BKK-HAN (Economy) on a B777-300. Both flights on time the first took off 20 Minutes prior to scheduled and landed 30 minutes too early. Excellent service at check-in counters and full info on seat options provided. The new Business Class Lounge in Noi Bai T2 is new friendly and bright and provides an excellent view of lanes and planes. Several hot dishes presented I preferred the marinated fried fish and the beef stew. New cozy spacious shower rooms offered. A couple of small wild birds made the visit memorable and pleasurable they seem to have not only been bewildered into the airport but obviously settled there as I saw also 1-2 birds there a 2 months earlier. Business Class almost fully lie flat. Service on board top notch though food options limited on this short sector. They ran out of prawn salad when they came to my seat and option was only a hot snack plate nothing top brawl about. I could have as many as I wanted however. Denied my so much wanted cheese plate as this is not offered for short sectors (likewise no amenity kit). FA's were in a sparkling mood lifting the whole thing. Drink service quick and fairly frequent. Many drink options inc. three different champagnes and pre-take-off drinks offered. Economy class on way back was also about as good as it gets. Champagne provided on request. Staff in Economy are quite impersonal but do the job. In Bangkok QR uses Thai Airways lounges which are good but somehow I prefer the new Business Class lounge in Hanoi operated by NASCO. None of them have sparkling wine and Hanoi lounge offers only local wine.,Promoter

I am a BA Silver card holder and decided to try Qatar now they are part of the oneworld Alliance. We flew LHR to DOHA then onto Phnom Penh as the final outward destination. The flight from London to Doha was their new Business A380 seats. On board there was a bar where we sat enjoying a drink with other passengers. The crew service is excellent and the products provided. Also the meal on board was enjoyable so was their lounge in T4 Heathrow. Again service way above other carriers.

SIN-DOH-IKA on B787 and A320 return SYZ=DOH-SIN on A320 and A350. Seats very comfortable except for B787. I am only 5 foot 4 but the entertainment box which is under both the aisle and window seats is terribly intrusive. It was my first flight on a B787 and while the quiet engines and improved humidity were a welcome change the cramped seats made it very difficult to sleep. Will avoid flying with Qatar on the 787 in future. Thankfully they have decided to switch to the A350 to Singapore which was an infinitely more comfortable flight. Crew on all flights were excellent and food was generally very good. Fantastic personal AVOD available on every flight except from DOH-IKA.,Promoter
I flew CPT-DOH-FRA on B787/A350 (16 April 2015) and return LHR-DOH-CPT on A380/B787 (30 April 2015). All in all a massive disappointment. B787 is without doubt the most uncomfortable aircraft I have flown on and is to be avoided. Qatar Airways like most others have opted for the high density seating in economy of 3x3x3 instead of 2x4x2 for which the aircraft was designed. This results in horrendously narrow seats with poor pitch and legroom. Worst of all a hard metal entertainment box in the foot well of every window and aisle seats. The box takes at least one third of foot well space and forces ones feet close together if you wish to stretch out your legs. The metal box bites into the side of your shin and is painful and uncomfortable. The new Airbus A350 with a wider body and 3x3x3 is far better. More spacious more width and a less intrusive entrainment box in the foot well. A350 XWB wins hands-down in passenger comfort over it's rival B787. Food was average to abysmal on all sectors served lukewarm to cold. Drinks service okay and champagne and cognac a plus in economy class. On all flights the crew were friendly but surprisingly disorganised during meal service. Running backwards and forwards through the cabin to supply vegetarian meat and chicken dishes not correctly loaded in trolleys. There was a clear lack of effective communication between crew members during service. Cultural issues perhaps as the staff are a multinational mish-mash from all over the world. Better communication and cultural diversity training for staff would help. The awful cramped B787 and shockingly bad food on 2 sectors (lukewarm and mass packaged and prepared). Avoid any sectors that use the B787 Dreamliner it's a nightmare.,Detractor
PER-DOH-CDG and return. Just did Perth to Doha in business on a 777 and then Doha to Paris economy on the 380 and return the same way. All trips on time. We had a look at business class on the 380 but prefer the layout on the 777. Economy upstairs on the 380 was fine for the shorter journey. What was excellent was the service. Consistently very high standard from FA's. As Qantas gold members we chose Qatar over Emirates because there was several thousand dollars difference in cost for our package and Qatar still gave us One World benefits. Would not hesitate to choose them again. We used Qantas lounge in Perth which is not bad Air France premium lounge at CDG which has all the amenities of the QF lounge at Karratha and the Qatar lounge it Doha which is simply superb.,Promoter

Flight MXP to BKK in November 2014. Both flights on schedule. The A330 from MXP to DOH was rather old and very few leg space. The B777 from DOH to BKK was rather ok but still I had the feeling that they reduced in this aircraft as well the leg space. Honestly I can't complain because I paid a very low rate. On the MXP-DOH flight staff made a mess with the meal requests I made during my booking. While serving food they told me the low fat meal wasn't available and they served me the normal meal. After 40 minutes an other hostess passed by to serve me the low fat meal. On the DOH-BKK flight everything was ok.,Promoter
Economy SIN-DOH-ATH 9 May and VIE-DOH-SIN 16 May. Boarding at Singapore on time and flight departed slightly behind schedule. The seats on the B787 were a bit cramped and not the most comfortable. Entertainment system was good and meal service was prompt. Very good snack sandwiches and main meals. Transfer at Doha was seamless - upon disembarking I could clear the transit security within 10 minutes. Flight to Athens on an older A330-300 entertainment system a bit dated food was good and service was ok. Seat was very good though. Departed Doha behind schedule and arrived in Athens around 10 minutes late but bags were on the belt within 20 minutes of disembarking the aircraft. Return from Vienna was good - check-in was fast and boarding took around 20 minutes although it was a bit disorganised. Vienna-Doha flight was operated by the B787 once again seats and entertainment was ok. The veg meal I got on this flight was pretty good and crew were very professional. Had the privilege to fly on the A350 from Doha to Singapore and the aircraft was a step up from the B787. Seats had more pitch/width and the earphone and USB ports are now integrated into the screen the entertainment system worked perfectly. Flight on this sector was not full but the service was the best of the lot. Cabin crew went around on several drink and snack services and the main breakfast meal on this sector was good. Arrival in Singapore on time and bags were on the belt within 20 minutes. It was a good experience with Qatar Airways and I look forward to flying more of the A350 in future.,Promoter
"Flew LHR to BKK and back a few weeks ago final destination Siem Reap in Cambodia. Picked my flights based on trying out the A380 for one leg and then other three sectors on the 777-300ER which I'd read reviews were the most comfortable. Funnily enough found the A380 segment the most enjoyable and comfortable - both hard and soft product just seemed a little bit more ""all there"" and I could swear there was more legroom in the A380 than on the 777 despite the official figures saying otherwise - Maybe seat thickness and how it's sculptured? Food is average but edible - Oh and there's no timing advantage to pre-ordering a special meal it gets loaded in the trolley and served alongside everybody else's. On the way back journey originated in Siem Reap in Cambodia on Bangkok Airways - Because they code share w QR I managed to get my luggage checked through to LHR even got boarding passes issued all the way too!",Promoter
MAN to BKK economy via Doha. Both legs delayed by at least an hour though boarding on-time. Was worried about connection at Doha but assured nothing to worry about as we had made up the lost hour. At Doha circled for over 30 mins before landing. Airport (state of the art new Hamad hub airport) in chaos due to smog. Face masks required all though airport! I have never experienced this in my life time. In-flight entertainment system excellent as are food and drinks services. This is an airline where staff appear happy in their jobs. On both legs one cooked meal (delicious) then one snack ( a wrap or a pasty) handed out. During flight soft drinks and snacks available. Good choice of free alcoholic drinks too including champagne by request. I don't usually travel economy class for long haul flights but it is well worth it with Qatar.,Promoter

LHR-DOH-BKK-DOH-LHR. It's been a few years since I last flew QR so I was interested in seeing whether they'd kept their standards as high as I remembered. Largely I wasn't disappointed and having flown on 777/A330/A340/A380 I got to try out most of their LH types. Cabin crew are still as good aircraft interiors are still pristine (especially on the A380 although understandable as only 6 months old). Hamad International is a great improvement on the old Doha airport for transit. If I were to criticise anything it would be the food. This definitely seems to have deteriorated a bit.

Usual obliging service on board from a very courteous and professional crew.

Recently flew LHR-AUH-LHR with a stopover in Doha. It wasn't my first time that I used QA but I sincerely hoped that their service will improve. I was wrong! Ground staff during the check-in at LHR was not nice. People you need to start smiling! Airbus A340 was spacious so there were no problems with a legroom. Inflight entertainment was ok. Cabin crew was inattentive sometimes not polite. I have asked for a glass of water before they started serving the meal but didn't get any Crew member looked unsatisfied when I interrupted her with a glass of water request. I also had to remind them about the bland meal that I've pre-ordered. Return flight from Abu Dhabi to Doha had 1 hour delay.

Recently flew from LHR to AUH via DOH. First leg was supposed to be an A380 which I specifically booked changed to a 777 which was annoying but nonetheless very comfortable. A comfortable 3-3-3 configuration on 777 unlike other Gulf carriers which opt for a cramped 3-4-3. Transit at Hamad international was very simple a very clean and not too large airport. Lots of food given and even champagne served in economy! A320 DOH-AUH and back decent snack provided good for a short-haul. Again easy transit and onto a very new A330 back to LHR service fantastic but seats were noticeably smaller in width compared to 777 but a very new IFE. On departing LHR I arrived late at the airport but the Qatar ground staff were very reassuring and helpful making sure I caught the flight.,Promoter
At the end of March and again the beginning of April we travelled from TXL to DOH in an A330-200 business class. The total impression of the interior was not positive but rather rundown. The cabin staff on the other hand Ã¢â‚¬â€œ were very polite and helpful making the flight really agreeable. The electronic seat adjustment device of a great number of seats did not really work so you had to put up with some awkward seating positions. The most unusual sight was a passenger nearly lying flat on the seat during landing after several staff tried in vain to put the seat in an upright position. Another highlight were the attempts of several cabin staff members to unlock dining tables with spoons. In the end they succeeded. The meals did not really offer inflight dining experience it was more business as usual - nothing worth mentioning. On the whole we had the impression that for this unimportant route written off aircraft's are used whose cabin maintenance leaves a lot to be desired. On our return flight there were no technical problems worth mentioning except that now the cabin crew members were more interested in chatting with each other than serving meals and drinks.,Detractor
LHR-DXB via DOH. Both legs of the flights were operated by an aged A340-600. I think Qatar should start thinking of not sending these aircraft's to such long haul routes. Aircraft was very tired from inside and the leg room was awful - so tight. Your flight would be ruined if the person in front reclines their seat as there will no room for you to move or watch. Food was of a very low standard. Coming back again aircraft was an A330-200/300 leg. Frankly speaking the leg room was much better on this aircraft however again old and tired from inside with cabin crew not being attentive to passengers.,Detractor
LHR-DOH-BKK in economy all the way on their brand new A380. Two great trips. Only problem is that the food is terrible and portions extremely small. Why do they bother? Best take your own. I had a rubbery chicken which tasted like something else. Space in economy seats on the A380 is extremely generous equivalent to BA WT+. Very impressive. Connection at Doha was very easy: off the plane and straight into departure area for connecting passengers no security check there. I am a BA Gold card EC so am allowed to use First check in First lounges and priority boarding. However Qatar is so fussy about its premium passengers I was not allowed to board via priority First class boarding even though I was in small economy cabin at the back of the upper deck where First and Business are located. I had to board and disembark via usual channels via lower cabin which means if you are in economy in the upper deck you will be last to disembark. Cosy small cabin though. Is this in breach of Oneworld rules regarding perks of being Emerald? The word that first came to my mind is segregation. They take incredible measures to protect their premium passengers from any contact with the rest of us ordinary mortals. I have never seen anything like this in my many years of continuos travelling in First Business and economy. Staff are professional. I had access to First class lounge at Doha which is gigantic nice but mayhem at peak hours. Amazing service though. The good thing about it is that there are several areas one could choose from. I went for the one adjacent to the business centre which was very quiet indeed. Both flight were not full. LHR to DOH was almost empty. A good experience I am happy to repeat especially when the price for tickets was one of the best I have seen in years to get from LHR to BKK.,Promoter

ZRH-DOH first time travelled on this Dreamliner. Pretty excited about that. Nice ambience and facilities though it is already started showing its age. Toilets were not clean enough. I think QR has a good investment in hardware but its software - i.e. the crew are not as attentive as other airlines that I've travelled on before. eCheck in at ZRH was a breeze attentive ground staff by SWISSPORT. Service started from pre-meal drinks meal snack another round of pre-landing pre-pour drink which was good enough for a 5-hour flight the IFE was good but not user-friendly as you need to key in the movie number for the specific movie.,Passive
SHJ-DOH-NBO March 9-14th. What was supposed to be a pleasant and enjoyable flight actually has been a nightmare from the beginning to the end. Check-in at Sharjah was chaotic a ground staff member belonging to Air Arabia opened the counter 30 minutes late and were needing 15 to 20 minutes to treat every passenger even in the priority lane. My request for an emergency exit for a wider pitch was ignored. Had to ask 3 times for the Business Class lounge invitation card and the female agent even forgot to give my passport to me after (finally) printing my tickets. Police controls were crowded the time spent at the VIP lounge was the only enjoyable moment. QR Chef d'Escale was very friendly and helpful. No special welcome for Privilege club old A320 aircraft snack served was awful and nothing other than water available. Transit time at Doha was the worst: despite QR sales office promise of hotel accommodation being provided for more than an 8 hour transit I discovered that passengers coming from/going to Sharjah were excluded of this courtesy. I had to stay overnight in the Oryx Lounge which was crowded. No earplugs nor eye mask available. At least showers were very clean and comfortable. Food offer was ridiculous coffee machine was not working. DOH-NBO morning flight was miserable: old tired A320 no IFE for a 5 hours flight seats cramped no special welcome for Privilege Club and no geovision. The same can be said about the return flight with the same issue at Doha regarding transit. My last time with Qatar Airways.,Detractor
Our route was on March 3 2015 London - Doha - Johannesburg - Port Elizabeth and was quite OK. Everything up to expectations. Our flight back on April 9th was also OK until the flight on April 10th from Doha to London flight no.

Manchester to Melbourne return - flight very good as always I had 2 seats to myself on the Doha to Melbourne which enabled me to have about 6/7 hrs sleep. The only criticism is that the films/music etc is a little outdated and the films are quite old.

QR845 12 March KUL-DOHA. QR237 DOH-IST. Return flight 23 March QR240. IST-DOH. QR844 DOH-KUL. Was given different seats from Doha to Istanbul although I have booked the seats and got a confirmation email from Qatar Airways resulting us being separated from each other. Tea and coffee were not offered and took quite a long time to get a cup of coffee after requested for one. On the flight back from Istanbul to Doha lunch took ages to be served. The air hostesses don't seem to move and was at the first 3 rows for almost 1 hour while those serving on the other side has already distributed to all passengers. Please improve.,Passive
Flew CDG-DOH-SGN-HAN-DOH-CDG: flights CDG-DOH and returns on A380 very good flights service and entertainment with enough size leg space (I am 6.20). Flight DOH-SGN on A330 old plane lucky plane half empty. Very good service. Return HAN-DOH a nightmare. Was a B777 with technical stop in BKK total 11 hours on a seat with broken seat cushion. Perception on being seated on a wooden bar. Luckily could move to another seat after some time (two weeks after return still hurts when seating). In general very good service friendly staff and transit in DOH without any problem. I would recommend QR except for this seat problem on the B777.,Passive
LHR-DOH-HKT 19/3/2015. First leg was the ageing A340 which I must add was a superb aircraft very comfortable. Second leg was a A330-300 not so great seats felt worn out. Service wise I have found having travelled with Qatar that it would appear they put their 'best' staff on the Heathrow route and other routes such as Phuket tend to get staff with lower ability. Overall having been a loyal customer of Qatar over the years I am not sure I will be in the future. I agree with other comments that Qatar are riding on past reputations. Food is average at best. Inflight service is now lip service and crew tend to walk past whilst offering teas and coffees without actually making eye contact. And entering and leaving the aircraft they might as well have no one on the doors. They did however provide bassinets for my kids (although on the Phuket flight crew never assembled it correctly). Whilst not directly related to Qatar - The New Hamad Airport is a joke lack of signage and direction and the lack of air bridges and speed of connections is appalling for what is supposed to be a new state of the art airport.,Passive
BKK-DOH-LHR 1/4/2015. First leg was the new A380 which I personally feel is average at best. Certainly spacious but does not feel as opulent as Emirates A380. Second leg was an A340 which was fine. Service really wasn't great. Whilst staff are smiley it does feel very forced now and I can see the change over the last few years. Food again was average. Whilst not directly related to Qatar - The New Hamad Airport has a lack of signage and direction and the lack of air bridges and speed of connections is appalling for what is supposed to be a new state of the art airport. On the way back Qatar had a sand storm the terminal building was filled with sand and people were really suffering. Whilst I understand this is an act of nature I would like to think if you operate in a region that has extreme weather conditions then you accommodate accordingly.,Passive
FRA-DOH on the new Airbus A350. What a nice experience-even quieter than the giant A380 this is a lovely plane and very nice interior that whilst is very similar to the 787 is another level up in terms of classiness-next flight was on a 787 from Doha-Singapore. Looking forward to our return journey on the A350. Also worth noting that routing FRA-SIN was so much cheaper than LHR-SIN - but more hassle to get a connecting BA flight from LhR to FRA but for the 3 of us it saved several thousand pounds!,Promoter
I will never fly Qatar Airways again flying Manchester-Doha-Johannesburg and return. Outbound flight good friendly check in assistant who allocated me an emergency exit seat with extra leg room because of my disability. Worst problem was the 7 hour wait in Doha which we were aware of. However on the return flight unfriendly and unwilling to assist at check in even though I am registered on their site as disabled and therefore not able to check in online no assistance given. We were given our tickets and thankfully I checked our connection from Doha to Manchester and it had been changed and we were not informed. This resulted in a six hour wait in Doha instead of an hour and half. No assistance given on either leg of journey to allocate me extra legroom and only when we were about to board the flight from Doha to Manchester we then discovered we were in separate rows but I had been allocated a middle seat which with my disability makes it worse. We managed to change seats on the airplane thanks to a helpful fellow traveler but with no assistance from the airline crew. Also found the seats very uncomfortable and had a sore back for days after returning home. Never again!,Detractor

I rode in economy class from YUL to DOH and then back again on the Qatar Airways Boeing 777-300er.

I would also recommend choosing Emirates for longer flights like YUL to DOH.,Passive
"There are two reasons why I would never fly with Qatar airways again: 1) Their apparent policy regarding delayed flights. I spent 13 hours at Kathmandu airport this weekend waiting for a flight back to London via Doha. Weather may be beyond their control but how they respond to it is not. They were the last of the airlines to be able to land and filled the first flights in with passengers on later scheduled flights in priority to ourselves who had waited the longest. Consequently our 12.30pm flight finally got away at 9.30pm when they appeared to find an extra plane under the sofa . Not a great disaster in the scheme of things but if I have a choice of an airline that makes an attempt to get those who have waited the longest away first then I will take it. 2) Comfort: The seats appear to be ergonomically designed for maximum discomfort. I am a 5ft 5"" guy who weights 8 stone and I had problems I can't imagine what it must be like if you are taller and wider. After about 2 hours in to a 7 hours flight I was really struggling. That said I can't fault the service-the cabin crew were efficient friendly and attentive. Shame then about 1 and 2.",Detractor

Singapore-Doha-Edinburgh on the 787. Lounge in Singapore was better than I expected after reading reviews small selection of hot and cold food and small drinks selection but it was cool and fairly quiet. Good priority boarding at Singapore and bus transfer at Doha - separate bus exclusively for business class. On both legs we were welcomed on board by name and shown to our seats and given pre takeoff drink and the offer of a newspaper and amenity bag provided. Pyjamas were only provided on the Singapore-Doha leg. At all times we were referred to by name and after takeoff CSD introduced themselves staff checked that we knew how all the controls worked on the seat and IFE I witnessed them showing great patience helping an elderly gentleman get to grips with the IFE. We were provided with a wine and food menu and it was explained that we could dine as and when we wanted. The food and wine selection was very good and the food was presented very well. The cabin crew were continuously walking the cabin quietly offering service when it was required. Found the seat very comfortable in all positions and managed to sleep for around 4-5 hours on each leg. The toilets were spacious and were kept in a spotless condition Our first experience of Qatar and I can guarantee that it won't be our last. A world apart from our outward trip on BA. Totally recommend Qatar Airways.,Promoter
Flew LHR-DOH on the A380 Lounge access at LHR was great - really personalised service. Felt like being in a swanky hotel rather than a lounge. On-board the seats were fine not as nice as Emirates but for sure a comfy space. Great food and beverage service little tip they leave the Krug at the bar worth the walk over! IFE was a bit skippy. DOH-RHY on 787 they used Business but rebrand it as first Short trip so fine - not a major fan of the 787. The lounge in Riyadh is abysmal but it's shared. Spent time in duty free to avoid this lounge. Doha terminal nice easy to have a long layover especially here with the family rooms available for a sleep and Krug on Tap. Don't recommend the 45 min transfer the terminal is big and there is no help on connections to get you there on time - at least they let business out as priority so I had a chance and the run woke me up a little bit. DOH-LHR was on the Business One A319 aircraft. Comfortable Seats IFE didn't work properly (kept skipping again but more frequently) but as they handed out PJ's it encouraged everyone to go to sleep. Service on both legs excellent.,Promoter
Qatar Airways has been a long time favourite as the service is extremely good. On the flight QR564 from Doha to Delhi on 19 March I had very severe earache and I must say that the chief steward really went the extra mile providing me with a hot honey and lemon drink - mush appreciated and really unexpected for an economy class passenger! However the boarding at Delhi on 8th March was a terrible experience - standing in 5 queues for an hour and a half at dawn is not funny especially for a senior citizen. Also there was no in-flight entertainment on the flight from Doha to Nairobi nor on the one from Dar es Salaam to Doha. Plus the meal served on the Doha Delhi flight was really substandard - some kind of chicken korma!,Passive
Nice cabin on newish 777 Dreamliners PHL-Doha-Colombo. Improved legroom in coach good entertainment and food. Cabin crew well above par. One small complaint: The free Doha city tour (layover of five hrs) a great idea and heavily hyped on their site and inflight magazine can only accommodate twenty people at a time and I believe only goes out every two hours. It's a joke as thousands are connecting through at any given time. (if you haven't guessed we were bumped and somewhat casually by the ground staff in Doha who were more interested in returning to their chat than apologizing or explaining the situation).,Promoter

Travelled over the Christmas period 24/12/14 to 12/1/15 to Singapore Changi. Was hesitant after having read some of the reviews. It had been a couple of years since I had travelled with them last. Was traveling with family so 3 adults and 3 children aged 6 2 and 1. Overall experience was excellent and would travel with them again. The planes were fairly new. Plus points-Qatar staff at all airports from Manchester to return from Changi were great with children which was our biggest worry. Also were very helpful during all flights. Food and drink were served frequently through all flights. Only some minor negatives the entertainment for children was very basic - checked prior to flight and a lot of the programmes that had been mentioned were not available on flight which was disappointing. Also pre-ordered my mothers food who eats Asian non veg food but not beef. Requested the Hindu non- veg meal thinking they will most likely serve Chicken or Lamb for this request but to my mothers disappointment they served prawns (very lovely indeed from my point of view) so if anyone like my mother you may have to request specifically what you want prior as a special request. Would travel with them again.,Promoter
Trip was Stockholm to Dubai via Doha (Economy class). Flow with the new 787 Dreamliner and as many have written here the seats are quite bad. Really disappointing since I had higher expectations on Qatar Airways. The seats are small legroom is tight and the IFE-box takes up to much space. The entertainment-system is good food and service is also good. Also flew with their A330 which is more comfortable but the entertainment system is really old now. Their best airplanes are without doubt the Boeing 777 which is both comfortable and modern. That's the plane I recommend if you travel with Qatar Airways. But for me I will choose another carrier next time.,Passive
Flew LHR-Doha-Cape Town out Jo'burg-Doha-LHR back. Much cheaper than BA direct flight which we have used before. Service comfort and food all several grades better than BA as well. Well worth the extra 6 hours journey time and change in Doha for the better comfort and service alone. Change at Doha with 2 hour window was easy and actually broke the journey nicely.

AMD-DOH-LHR. The lounge in Ahmedabad is very funny. All the airlines use it but it is more of a cupboard behind a restaurant. The flight to Doha is on an A321 and is fine. Its not lie flat or anything but its a very short flight. On the return leg we flew on the new A380 from Doha to London. That was a horrible experience and I will avoid this aircraft like the plague. The service is terrible you have to wait ages for anyone to attend to you. I think its because there are too many people. Stick with the 777 if you can. The IFE keeps hanging or the controls fail. I gave up after the 3rd attempt and went and sat in the bar with my wife which is quite pleasant.,Detractor
LHR-DOH-AMD and back again. The lounge in London is really nice. We flew on the A340-600 which is quite old and is not lie flat but its decent enough. The lounge in Doha is horrible especially compared to the old one. Its huge impersonal and it feels like most of the airport is in there with you rather than being a quiet sanctuary. More like a school canteen than a business lounge. The flight to Ahmedabad is on an A321 and is fine. Its not lie flat or anything but its a very short flight.,Promoter
BCN-DOH-DXB inbound flight made on January 5th after an outbound on December 18th with Royal Jordanian. BCN-DOH first leg was neither a good nor bad surprise: quite smooth check-in thanks to my Sapphire OneWorld status enjoyable VIP Lounge at BCN airport (although not well-provided at all about food) respected Priority Boarding no delays. Equipment was a newly-configured Airbus A330-200 I was seated in an emergency exit so I had extra legroom. Food average nice selection of beverages. Things became complicated when I collapsed on the 5th hour of the flight (hyper arterial pressure) and was put within hands of cabin crew. QR does not know how to manage a simple issue whatsoever: disembarked at DOH all the way to airport clinic then sent to Hamad hospital for further examinations. The nightmare took 19 hours. Had to fly back to DXB on the following day. Had to spend overnight at Oryx Lounge.,Passive
"I flew BRU-DOH-DXB and back. Even though the leg DOH-DXB is rated as first class I sub-summarize it as a business class trip because the cabin product is the same. The cabin and the seat are very comfortable nothing to complain. But the service level in general is very low. Starting by the performance of the cabin crew in business class: very hectic not really attentive. They don't use trolleys in business class they serve every guest individually from the galley. This leads to a very hectic atmosphere in the cabin because the crew has to walk a lot. They miss having any grace whilst serving it seems the invention of a service tray has been totally ignored. They bring your plate with bare hands from the galley when they realised that they forgot a spoon and knife they came back holding the spoon in one hand and the knife in the other instead of putting in on a tray and serving it nicely. On the short trip from Doha to Dubai this one-after-another type of service lead to the fact that the last business class row was served only 5 minutes prior to the start of the descent so the poor people could not even finish their meal. But the worst I had to experience was the check-in in Dubai: there was one counter for first and business class passengers and one counter for status members. Both lines totally overcrowded and the check-in procedure went on really slow. After waiting for more than 30 min. some of the first class passengers tried to move to the so called ""help desk"" to ask for check-in there. Suddenly a Qatar airways representative appeared and yelled at them they should go back to their line. I waited more than 50 minutes until I could check- in. The ""first-class"" lounge of Qatar airways is very small and old and was totally overcrowded. Not the way I want to be treated as a first or business class passenger. I think they have to do first a lot of improvement in their service level until they can compete with airlines such as Singapore Airlines.",Passive
I had never flown with Qatar before but what a wonderful surprise. Early check in at Heathrow and returning at Kathmandu meant we had extra leg room seats on all sectors there and back. Drinks service was wonderful and you can have what you want I was allowed to have champagne with my dinner. The food choice was lovely and tasty. The staff could not do enough for the passengers I have to say I would recommend and definitely fly with Qatar again. If I had any advice I would say they needed another set of toilets on the planes and I found the seats a little tight although I am a large man and I had extra legroom so it did not matter.,Promoter
Went with Qatar Airways from Stockholm to Dubai through Doha. First flight was with their new Boeing 787 - Dreamliner. Good entertainment system high resolution screen but slow response in the touch and a lack of music and TV-series. The seat config is not good however the leg-room is a bit disappointing. Otherwise the Dreamliner is a nice airplane. On the way back it was with the A330 which is getting old and they should really change the entertainment system onboard. It didn't even work so the flight back was quite boring. Had a short flight with their B777 also from Doha to Dubai which is probably the best airplane Qatar has got right now. More legroom good entertainment system and so on.,Passive
BCN to KUL via DOH. All flights on A-330 200 . The seatmaps for this type of plane are a little misleading. They all show the 4 rows of Biz Class in one large block but the reality is rows 1-3 are in the forward cabin and strangely row 4 only is on its own in a very small section between the Galley and Econ section. My wife and I were seated in seats 4 J+K. It does feel pretty private but of course you are more prone to any noise from kids etc behind in Econ. I guess you pays your money and takes your choice! Food copious and excellent quality on all flights but they can be a bit slow in refilling wine glasses. Even these refurbished A330's are beginning to show their age and frankly the seats are rather lumpy and not all that comfortable even when fully flat. Whilst the boarding at both KL and Barcelona was fine I have to say I was disappointed with that at Doha. 3 out of the 4 flights to or from there were from outlying stands not jetways. I really find it hard to see how with a brand new airport that trumpets itself as one of the world's best that so many flights involve a long trek followed by being herded onto a bus and having to climb steep steps to board . That sort of thing may have been OK on a charter flight to Majorca from Luton in the '80s but really does not cut the mustard in 2015 on a Business class ticket on a supposedly 5* airline! But overall for the price it is a good product.,Passive
Travelled Business Class DOH-FRA. Was booked on the new A350 with flat beds. Two days before the flight plane was swapped to an A330 with ski slope beds. This is the third time I have had an aircraft substitution to an inferior product with Qatar. Until they can standardise their Business Class product to that of their 787's/A380's I would not recommend them as what product you receive on the day you fly seems a total lottery. If a flat bed and sleep is a priority for you avoid.,Detractor

LHR-DOH-DXB and back. On London to Doha QF seems to use a mix of aircraft for their many daily flights I experienced the A340-300 both there and back. The aircraft is starting to show its age the seats are uncomfortable and the picture / sound quality on the video on demand sets poor compared to what you get on more modern aircraft these days. However the legroom seemed generous compared to BA Virgin et al. Service was good though on the way back they switched on the lights on a night flight while still over Romania so a good two and a half hours from Heathrow to serve breakfast. Doha's new Hamed International Airport is brand new and a pleasant place to transit through and from Doha to Dubai Qatar used a Dreamliner for what's only a 45 min flight. Despite small issues here and there I'd definitely take them again. They were the cheapest on the route and the experience is still better than what you get on most European (let alone N American) carriers long haul. QF and the other Middle Eastern airlines also haven't introduced the practice of making you pay to choose your seat and if you use the app you can change it as many times as you want (in my case I managed to get a free seat next to me on each stretch) pre check in.,Promoter
QR1360 JNB-DOH. Seat 4A. After an on-time departure from JNB the bell went off to signal to the cabin crew that they could leave their jump seats to start their work in the cabin. Several passengers in the business class cabin took this as an indication that they could leave their seats even though the seat belt sign was still illuminated. A woman in the row ahead of me got up to use the lavatory. I told her that the seat belt sign was still on so she returned to her seat. Another passenger from row 1 started making his way down the aisle to the lavatory so the woman in front of me said â€œwhy don't you tell himâ€. So I also told him that the seat belt sign was still on and he returned to his seat. When the sign was eventually turned off about ten minutes later the woman in front of me while going to the lavatory stopped at my seat and said â€œdo I have your permission to go to the washroom?â€ Honestly the crew should be paying more attention not leaving it to passengers to tell other passengers when it is safe to move around the cabin. A tense atmosphere on board could and should have been avoided by the crew doing their job which lets not forget is first and foremost about safety not service.,Passive

Flew from LHR to DOH 23rd February for an onward connection to Phuket. The connection at Doha was very tight at 45 mins but I assumed that Qatar had it sorted for a quick transit. QR 002 arrived in Doha 10 minutes behind schedule so not an ideal start. It took ground staff almost 15 mins to get the first passengers off. Absolutely no help from ground personnel to fast track to connection. Despite dashing through security and arriving at the gate I was refused boarding and told that the plane had left. I know for a fact that this flight arrives in Phuket most days almost an hour ahead of schedule so why not wait for the dozen affected passengers. I booked my ticket direct with Qatar so would have expected them to assist me to make a tight connection that they sold me.,Passive
Manchester-Doha-Melbourne 20th Feb 2015. First leg to Doha on A330-200 not fully booked I had aisle seat plenty of room for my legs (I'm six foot). My entertainment system froze halfway through the film I was watching so I ended up watching the screen on the next (empty) seat. Shiny screens so your reflection dominates a lot of what you watch. Food reasonable service seemed a little slow but overall a good first leg of the trip. There's only a 45 minute layover in Doha but they are well geared up for this and no trouble with missing luggage despite the gates being at opposite ends of the airport. Second leg to Melbourne on a 777-300ER almost full seats nowhere near as comfortable far less leg room. Better entertainment system than the Airbus matt screen so no reflection problems. Food probably slightly better but again seems to be a slow process. Overall however I arrived in Melbourne feeling fit and refreshed and would definitely take the same route again. Here's hoping for Airbus on the return journey.,Passive
LHR-DOH return QR016/015 on the all Business class A319 paid for with QMiles. Excellent food and drink provided by good crews.

Food portions were very small plastic fork and spoons mediocre and slow service. On a 8+ hour flight only served drinks once. Flights on all sectors were on time. Ran out of non-veg food on two sectors. Crew seemed amateur and clumsy. Except on the Jo'burg-Doha sector which was a daytime flight where the crew were cheerful and friendly they were grumpy on all other sectors. In between meals snacks were just a small packet of chips or chocolate. Snack with drinks only given on the Jo'burg-Doha sector were tasteless small bread sticks with a horrible salsa.

Flew LHR-DOH-DAC. The trip started at the Qatar Business lounge at T4. I thought the lounge was excellent. Food service comfort all first rate. The first flight was on an A319 all business class. The plane feels very exclusive and the level of service and attention was superb. However as a solo traveller I would opt for a different aircraft if possible which allows every passenger direct aisle access. Saying that I sat on the aisle and my neighbour sitting at the window never woke me up getting to the loo. The food was the best I have experienced on a flight. The food I had particularly the main course - lamb with couscous were superb. The flight departed and arrived an hour late but on this occasion this was no problem as I had quite a long layover at Doha. The plane parked on a remote stand and we were bussed on a limo-coach type of coach. It was equipped with 12 spacious sofas. There was no queue at the transit security they x-rayed our bags and I was through to the Al Mourjan lounge within minutes. The lounge is huge with plenty of space to sit I found a sofa to lie down for a few hours before taking a shower and having lunch at the upstairs restaurant. This was a buffet affair rather than cook to order at LHR. Overall I cant knock the lounge it was lovely but I much preferred the LHR lounge it felt more exclusive and the food offering was much better. Unfortunately my flight was delayed by +2 hours and ended up eating again at the lounge. I tried the downstairs restaurant but it only served cold food so returned to the upstairs restaurant. I departed from gate A8 which took about 10 minutes to get to. Amazingly I was the only passenger in Business Class there are 30 seats in the Business cabin of the A330-300 and it was weird having 29 empty seats and 5 FAs to look after me. I had a glass of excellent Billicart Salmon Brut champagne as a pre-flight drink then a fabulous St Clair Sav Blanc with my meal. I chose the mushroom and basil oil soup followed by a rump of lamb. I was too full for a any dessert The food was not as good as the first flight and as expected for a 4 hour flight it was a three course meal rather than a seven course banquet. We arrived just after 2am and I was through immigration in no time. Mainly as there were so few passengers requiring to complete visa on arrival. The hotel had arranged for a fixer to collect me and deliver me to the car pick up point where the hotel mini-van was there to collect me.,Promoter
Flew LHR-DOH on the A380 Lounge access at LHR was good but cheap Champagne. On-board the seat was great. Great food and beverage service. IFE was spot on too. DOH-DAC on A330 They used First Class seating as J seating so I managed to get a flat-bed. Food and beverage on that leg was not great dry possibly due to a delay out of DOH also the IFE has to be reset several times. Return sectors RGN-DOH was on the A330 comfortable seat once again the food from RGN wasn't great but I was hungry so ate it. DOH-LHR was on the Business One A319 aircraft. Comfortable Seats IFE didn't work properly (kept skipping) but I needed to sleep and I think I got about five hours.,Promoter
Just returned to Edinburgh today on QR027 from Doha on Dreamliner. As this is a day flight leaving at 7.30am which is why we booked it does anyone know why every single window blind was put in to blackout mode after breakfast was served (not done by the passengers) and the cabin lights dimmed? Stayed this way throughout flight couldn't even see what the FA was serving us unless you put reading light on. If I wanted the ambience of a night flight I would have booked one! Just wondered if it is Qatar Airways policy to do this even on daytime flights. We were in economy 12 E & F. More legroom on short haul 737s very cramped very disappointed passenger!,Passive

Flew from DOH-LHR on the 12.50pm flight and it was my poorest experience on QA to date. Started off well in the lounge with good service but as soon as I stepped onto the plane the AC was not working. The plane set off with a known fault. During the flight my in-flight system was not working and eventually I gave up. Furthermore on landing we were held on the tarmac without any update from the pilot and to compound a totally miserable flight the walkway was unable to be used due to power loss (not the fault of QA but added to the misery with pilots going into radio silence). What saved me from scoring the trip satisfaction as 1/10 was the usual impeccable flight crew service - top class. QA can do much better and on this flight the experience was anything but a 5* standard.,Detractor
"QR836 Doha to Bangkok new Airbus A380 should have been seat 46c economy but moved for no technical reason to a small economy area on the upper deck right at the back of the aircraft. Seat 27G. I chose seat 46c because of its position forward of the leading edge of the wing which on other 380's such as Emirates and Singapore are both relatively quiet and comfortable in turbulence. This new position was noisy (engine) and dreadful in turbulence because you are so close to the tail. I understand airlines cannot guarantee your seat request ""for technical reasons"" but there was nothing wrong with the seat I had chosen. My guess is that as a solo traveller I was probably moved to accommodate a group of two or more travellers that left there checking in and seat reservations until the last minute. I would love to know why people who book flights five or six moths in advance should be penalised for others that either book last minute or don't check in until the last minute. I was told by the cabin purser that the ground staff had moved many people and that that many passengers had complained.",Detractor

I flew Qatar last month multiple times DFW-DOH-IKA-DOH-MED JED-DOH-IKA-DOH-DFW. Have to say I agree with one of the previous reviews regarding staff behavior change as soon as they see a business or first class ticket. Had to change my boarding pass in Dallas while staying in the line the staff were really inattentive and not caring. As soon as I handed over my boarding pass all of the sudden the attitude changed and maybe apologized 4-5 times for making me wait in the line! Flight attendants are nice. Very polite some happier than others but overall very attentive. The food selection was not appealing to my taste but good specially if you are a fan of middle eastern and Indian types of food. Drink selections were really good. The meals are served a la cart. Has its own cons and pros. It is good to have the option of having what you want when you want. However can be bothersome in a sense specially when the cabin lights are turned off and are trying to get some sleep and the passenger next to you is trying to eat. Overall more satisfied with the short haul business class flights compare to long haul. Seats are very comfortable and wide. Plenty of legroom. I would be happy if the seat had a little separator/divider to give a little more privacy while sleeping specially if the passenger next to you chooses to read watch TV or eat. Doha airport is huge. Not the best airport for short layovers. Make sure you have at lease 90 minutes between two flight. I had 50 minutes and missed my flight. If everything goes well and right on schedule 50 minutes would have been enough but can be too short if your flight is delayed even 5 minutes and plane is not parked at a jetway and passengers are taken to the airport by the bus and so on. Airport staff are nice. Some are really helpful some not much I guess like anywhere else. The lounge is huge. Very contemporary decor. Not many food or drink options in the main sitting area. Two restaurants which can be very over crowded. Restrooms are very insufficient.,Passive

4 flights 3 of them were a very nice experience. New planes on time and very fast good service. Flight nr. 4 (7h) was with a older A330 and the crew was not so motivated or a bit disorganised. Very slow service. They skipped the first run with drinks and snack and start to serve with the dinner after a while. It took more than 90 minutes to get the first drinks and some food. That flight was a very different experience and not what you expect from a 5 star airline. The new economy seats at the 787 are not very comfortable. hard narrow and a metal box under the seat.,Promoter
"Flew on 787 Dreamliner from Doha to Singapore. Must say I was so close to my neighbor that I was afraid we would amalgamate into one! All the other amenities and food experience went right out of the window. Anyway all the other things like food entertainment crew were good. But none of it matters when a 6"" slightly heavy guy sits in the plane. Qatar Airways might be doing a great job in the Premium Class but since majority of the people travel by economy it should rethink its strategy. Chances of me travelling on Qatar are very small.",Detractor
JNB-DOH-KWI business class. Seat 4K on JNB-DOH on Dreamliner. On boarding went to lavatory to put on sweat pants and a tee-shirt and was offered on the way in a clothes hanger by the purser for the clothes I was changing out of. Nice touch. He came around and introduced himself to each biz passenger. One arm rest wouldn't move with the electronic function. Next thing I knew there was an engineer member of the ground staff lying in the aisle looking under my seat with a flashlight. Couldn't fix the problem but he sure tried. Food and service during the flight were excellent. Just before arrival in DOH the purser informed me that I would miss my connection to KWI and had been rebooked on a later flight. A member of the ground staff met me on disembarkment in DOH and took me immediately to the gate for my KWI flight which was delayed anyway due to fog in KWI. Lots of good attention from QR on these flights. I like the 1-2-1 seating in biz class on the 787.,Promoter

The flight from FRA to DOH had a delay therefore the connecting time to DOH to CMB was only 30 minutes. As earlier stated in some of the reviews from others some of the planes business class is just a better economic class as you are unable to rest. However I wouldn't mind recommending the airline.,Promoter
Flew economy on Boeing 787 Dreamliner from Edinburgh to Bali via Doha. Worst seating I have encountered in economy. Not only are the seats very narrow but some design genius who has never flown economy thought it would be a good feature to locate a large IFE box under the seat so one leg will always be constantly rubbing against it. When the seat in front is reclined there is no room to move so the people in the window or middle seat are trapped. Service was ok but choice of movies not as extensive as Emirates.,Detractor

QR708 IAD-DOH. Seat 3K. Not sure what happened to QR this evening but from the start it is not what one expects from this carrier. My last four trips with QR including this one have entailed lengthy business class check-in waits at IAD. Why can't QR at IAD have enough dedicated business class check-in counters to manage the flow of checking-in passengers in a way that prioritizes high yield customers? Waiting 30 minutes to check-in from the business class line while watching economy class passengers who arrived well after me breeze up to the counter is just not acceptable. QR needs to look at this seriously. This isn't the first time I've encountered this while checking in for this flight at IAD. The flight left early. Turbulence early on delayed the dinner service. However once it started the left aisle of the business cabin was on to their second course before passengers on the right aisle even had a drink. The purser should ensure consistency throughout the cabin. The FA working in my aisle asked if she could clear my service items before I'd even been served the main course. I informed her that I hadn't had dinner yet. When ordering appetizers I was told that one of my appetizer selections might not be available as many other passengers had ordered the same thing. Really? The business cabin is not full and I'm in row 3. My main course for the dinner a lamb shank with root vegetables was entirely under-whelming. When put in front of me the sauces were congealed. Once I started to eat it it was only tepidly warm. The purser came around and asked me how my meal was and I told her it was not hot and that it looked like it had been sitting for a while. I got a nice smile and an I'm sorry Sir but no offer to have it re-heated or replaced. What particularly irked me was that just minutes after take-off the purser went around the cabin summarily closing everyone's window shades. A hand appeared from the row behind me to close the window that I was looking out of at that moment admiring the night time view of New York. There's lots of time remaining just after take off on a night-time transatlantic flight for FAs to go around the cabin and discretely close the window shades before sunrise. Believe it or not some passengers may want to see the night-time lights of New York Boston Halifax or St. John's. If they want to close all the shades early on in the flight they can at the least ask passengers if they want their shades drawn rather than just briskly machine-like marching around the cabin closing them. Passengers typically chose window seats for a reason. Sorry QR not one of your better days.,Passive
"MXP-DOH-INC - PEK-DOH-MXP. 3 flights out of 4 on the 777 1 on the 330. Business seat on the 777 far superior compared to the rather cramped and angled 330. What I liked on the 777 seat is the fact that there is plenty of space and no ""foot box"" so you can sleep in any position and have freedom of movement. The 330 had the ""foot box"" which restricts movement and is quite annoying and doesn't go flat. Service on all sectors was excellent as was food and wines. Couldn't fault the staff at all. Having a 7 hour layover on the outbound trip we went on the free Doha city tour which was well worth it. Back in time to relax for a couple of hours in the enormous lounge. Would recommend Qatar but beware of travelling on the cramped 330 business class which is ok for a day flight but not a night flight.",Promoter
Outbound LHR-DOH-MEL return MEL-DOH-MAN. 3rd time flying Qatar business class. The Qatar lounge at LHR is incredible. Modern well designed comfortable with great staff and fantastic food and drinks on offer. We had a full breakfast with a couple of glasses of champagne and it was a great way to start our vacation. Our first flight from LHR was on the three class A340-600 and I was impressed. This was our first time on this aircraft type with Qatar and I was surprised how spacious it was. The angled lie flat seat was comfortable enough to get a few hours sleep. The galley is at the rear of business class so the front seats get served last. We had a couple of hours to kill in Doha before our next flight to Melbourne. This was our first time at the new Hamad airport. It was great not to have to do the long bus tour of the airport as you did at the old terminal. The business class lounge is really badly sign-posted but we found it eventually. The lounge was impressive but I think I was expecting more. Table service drinks throughout the lounge apart from one proper bar which is located upstairs. Return flights to Melbourne were on the 2 class 777. The space in business is incredible and the lie flat seats are comfortable. First time we've been given the mattresses which you now get with the usual PJs and slippers but only on night flights. I thought the mattress was a nice touch and added to the overall comfort. Our return flight from Melbourne used the Qantas business lounge which was really poor. Uncomfortable and a very poor selection of food and drink. I was glad to get out of there. Our Melbourne departure was delayed by 45 minutes and we only had a 65 minute transfer time at Doha. From my experience great customer service comes into play when things go wrong (like flight delays) and Qatar handled things superbly. We were met as we left the aircraft with details of our transfer gate and the aircraft was held on stand for us until we arrived. Our luggage was fast tracked and I was amazed to see it on the carousel at Manchester airport. The flight to Manchester was on the smaller A330.200 but again a great aircraft (slightly older) with an angled lie flat seat. Food and beverage on all flights was to a really good standard. But what really makes Qatar stand out though is the consistently high standard of service in business class. I was really impressed with this on all our flights and their five star status really is deserved.,Promoter
"DOH-CMB-DOH. Business Class. QR does not live up to its ""The World's Five Star Airline"" slogan on some routes. It could be three to four star service especially as they have varying business class products (seats IFE etc.) in their fleet. Outbound I carefully selected a B777-300ER when booking but they changed that later to an older A321 that did not have lie-flat sleeper seats on this 4.5 hour night flight that was scheduled to leave DOH at 01:05. It left DOH about an hour late due to the incoming aircraft's delay and failed to make-up the lost time when arriving in CMB. Boarding was very poor in DOH and CMB. The seats more like premium economy products in many airlines' fleets were most uncomfortable and the control buttons didn't respond well to make adjustments. No amenity kit was offered and the food served was slightly above average. It was good that there were only six passengers in the 12-seat cabin on that flight so we could spread out a bit. The two inflight staff members were very good and attentive. On the inbound flight the B777-300ER's seating product was in complete contrast to their A321 though still not on par with the latest offerings of some of their competitors and also their own B787/A380 business class products. The service and food were similar to the outbound flight. This flight was on time. The new QR business class lounge in DOH is outstanding and amazing in terms of design and services available. The new DOH airport itself is not as good as places like Changi in Singapore but a huge improvement over the old one.

Dec 15-Jan 1. QR734/556 and 733/557. DFW-DOH-BOM R/T on QR 777 (LR and ER) in business with family over the holidays. I flew Cathay in First from LAX-HKG R/T just a few days earlier and felt that this experience was on par with CX First and in some areas even better - and that says a lot as CX is world class. In my 15 years of top tier business travel this business class experience stood out as the best. Right from the pre departure drinks service to the excellent restaurant style (and quality) meals to the amenities on board (excellent Ferragamo and Armani kits mattress pads duvets pyjamas superb champagnes) to the crew and the world class new lounge at Hamad - this was an experience! The Business/First lounge at Hamad is huge (not Emirates huge) but manageable.

Manchester-Doha sector.â€“While boarding had to wait in the walkway leading to the aircraft door as clearing of the aircraft was in final stages of completion unfortunately icy cold gusts of wind were funnelling into the tunnel. However all this discomfort was easily forgotten on seeing the warm and cheerful welcome we received from the two smart cabin attendants at the doorway. As usual Qatar airways aircraft was spotlessly clean. The 2-4-2 seating of the A332 is ideal for couples who wish to have their space remain uncompromised. The seat pitch of ~32â€ and width of ~18â€ is better than many other offerings which give a claustrophobic â€˜sardine-can'ambience the cushioning is also more comfortable. The IFE has been upgraded to Touch Screen technology and the availability of Wifi is a further value addition. Service by the cabin staff was as good as ever. Flight deck crew also kept passengers updated on relevant flight parameters. Compared to my previous experience the only aspect that has slipped was the catering. On this sector breakfast and a snack were served I had requested a low-salt diet which was complied with in both instances but the quality of the offerings was very average tasteless and just warm the quantity of the serving has also diminished since my last economy class flight. Doha - Islamabad sector. Due to foggy conditions across parts of the North Indian sub-continent the flight was delayed by some 11 hrs. Though the airlines website stipulates that passengers whose transits exceed 8 hrs would be provided hotel accommodation commensurate with their class of travel they were unable to do so in many a case as the airport hotel had been totally booked they did however provide meal vouchers and make the â€˜quiet rooms available to the stranded passengers which I feel did alleviate their plight to some degree. The flight left on time according to the new delayed schedule and service on board was as good as always cabin crew were very pleasant and helpful throughout catering quality/quantity somewhat less than previous experiences but quite acceptable. The aircraft was well maintained and the as clean and tidy as I have always experienced with Qatar Airways.,Promoter

My husband and I flew economy via Qatar Airways into Chicago and returned via Philadelphia Dec 2014 and returned Jan 2015. The service both on land and in flight was exceptional!!!! The food and food presentation was first class! A pure joy in relation to other airlines we have flown. The air stewards were always willing to help well dressed and had a good attitude at all times. There is ample leg room even with the entertainment box if there was one at our feet. If you wish to fly Qatar please take a converter for your personal headphones as theirs is a 2 prong. We had a 24 hour lay over in Doha. Qatar Airways granted us an accommodation and food voucher. Our stay in Doha was wonderful and memorable. It is an easy process at Hamad Airport to get the vouchers and board the shuttle to the relevant hotel. I was anxious about this period but it was an easy stay over. My husband and I highly recommend Qatar Airways.,Promoter

LHR â€“ DOH â€“ MAA return on 21st â€“ 31st December '14. I flew the same route with Qatar in 2011 and was really impressed with the service at the time so was looking forward to the same thing this time travelling with my wife. On the day of our departure I was somewhat disappointed that due to a change of plane from A340 to A330 on the LHR-DOH leg my reserved seats no longer applied and we were stuck over the wing however we had at least been given seats together. It's fair to say that our impression of Qatar's in-flight experience for the whole of the first three legs (that is to Chennai and back to Doha on return) was good. All were on A330s (either -200 or -300s). The planes were comfortable with good leg-room (although beware of the entertainment box which takes up half the foot-space for all window seats) the cabin crew were attentive polite and friendly the food was impressively above average â€“ all the seats seemed to have been refurbished on our planes and were comfortable. As for the new Doha airport even though we only had a 1 hour transit each way it was clearly outstanding with plenty of space to relax use the internet watch TV and many shops albeit expensive ones. Overall the impression was very good though I would have said it had lost that real supreme feel that had so impressed me in 2011. Then on our final leg from Doha â€“ Heathrow I had managed to book this leg on the new A380. Suddenly the wow-factor returned! By some distance the best flight we have ever taken! Our seats had again been changed but boy were we glad! Between booking and flying I'd joined the Qatar Privilege Club and we'd been moved to the small economy section at the back of the top deck which had been fully blocked out when I reserved seats. Instead of 3-4-3 seating it's 2-4-2 and the experience was great. Comfortable seats lots of legroom big HD quality IFE screens fantastic service from 2 dedicated cabin crew and 2 toilets for just 8 rows of seats storage box next to the window complimentary mini amenity kit for all economy passengers and of course that great feeling of walking up the stairs inside the plane to reach our seats. The fact that its such a small section of economy makes it feel pretty exclusive too. In economy? Fly the A380 if you can!,Promoter
EDI-DOH-SGN. Short 75 minute transfer in Doha but everything went smoothly. Usual Hugh quality of food drink and service. The only downside was that the AV on the first sector (Dreamliner) didn't work.,Passive
MUC-DOH-KUL-SIN-DOH-MUC. My second trip with Qatar Airways. Crew and staff were very good at dealing with their tasks. Very friendly flight attendants. Food and Drinks were ok. 787 is a real dream. Very nice IFE system and also a nice atmosphere in the plane. A330 is also pretty decent but IFE system could be newer. Overall no problems with transfer or baggage. Will fly with them next year too.,Promoter
ARN-DOH-DAC and return in economy. ARN-DOH operated by a B787 and DOH-DAC operated by an A333. We had checked in online the night before so no long queues for us! Boarding was fast and efficient at ARN as usual. Was quite excited to fly on the 787 for the first time and I was fairly impressed by the mood lighting in the cabin. However the cabin felt quite cramped in this 9-abreast configuration. The load factor in Y was approximately 80%. The seats were decent the IFE was modern flight attendants were friendly and attentive and the food was great. Overall a great experience on this 6 hour flight. Transfer was smooth in the new Hamad airport. Next flight DOH- DAC on an A333. They changed the operating aircraft to a three class A333. The staff at DOH handled the situation well and new seats were given. My father got seated in business and the rest of us in Y. Flight was 95-100% full in Y. Overall a nice flight with friendly crew decent IFE and decent seats. The only letdown was the food. DAC- DOH operated by an A333 once again the flight was completely packed in business and economy. Boarding was smooth and we were off to DAC. Flight was great as usual with QR nice crew decent IFE and decent seats. The food was quite tasteless and once again the only letdown with this flight. Transfer in Doha was smooth as usual. DOH-ARN operated by A7-BCB I had bought the same plane in 1:200 from DOH. Load factor in Y was about 80-85%. The flight was great as usual except the food arrival at ARN was smooth. I was quite satisfied with QR except on the catering department. We chose QR because of the low fares and I would recommend them if the price is competitive.,Promoter
Our flight was Perth Australia to Manchester UK return and it was a pleasure. We had lie flat beds Perth to Doha. These are excellent even if you don't want to sleep but just want to stretch out. The cabin service was the best I have experienced in Business Class. You can have your meals when you want them. The service was always there and always excellent without being obtrusive. We will certainly be flying with Qatar again this year.,Promoter
Dallas-Doha-Bombay r/t in Business Class. Awesome experience. Excellent seats on B-777 ER/LR superb food (presented first class style - not a tray in sight) awesome lounge in Doha and service from the crew - best I have experienced (and I fly over 150K miles/year with One World). In fact I was on Cathay First a couple weeks prior from LAX-HKG-LAX and this QR service was as good or better (certainly better food on QR business than CX First). Great seat comfort with mattress toppers and duvets and seat massage function Excellent wines (presented restaurant style) and Champagnes - flawless. My wife and 2 kids felt the same way.,Promoter
We flew DXB-DOH-HKT in business return all on the A330 except the last leg on the 787. Very good service from the crew but can be a bit slow in getting drinks and food out. Business cabin is what you would expect from a quality airline like QR very good. IFE is good and food is not bad for airline food. All flights were on time. Business class in the dreamliner is excellent would love to fly a longer route on it. The lounge in DOH is excellent and massive! The Lounge in Phuket is a joke operated by Thai Airways I dont know why QR use it as the lounge beside it which Etihad use is much better. Definitely would fly Qatar again and recommend them.,Promoter
ARN-DOH-DAC return in economy. First leg ARN-DOH operated by a Boeing 787-8 was quite excited to fly on the B787 for the first time. We had checked in online so no long queues for us! Boarding was done on-time and efficiently. I was quite impressed with the lighting in the cabin however it felt fairly cramped in a 9-abreast configuration. The flight was about 80% full. Legroom was decent food was great the IFE was great and the flight attendants were very friendly and attentive. Transfer in Doha was smooth the next flight DOH-DAC operated by an A333. Plane change from two class A333 to three class A333. Our chosen seats got changed the staff handled the situation well and new seats were given. My father was placed in business and the rest of us in economy. Flight was about 95% full. Once again a great experience with friendly flight attendants great IFE and decent legroom. Only one option for the meal which was okay nothing special. Return flight DAC-DOH operated by a two class A333. Fight was 100% full. Friendly and attentive crew as usual boarding was done efficiently. We had a great flight with excellent service as usual however the only let down was the food. Transfer in Doha-Hamad was smooth. Lovely airport. We had a pleasant flight as usual but the food was still quite bad. We were offered with one option which is quite bad IMO. We were able to choose from a handful of options on the outbound flight (ARN-DOH). However I had excellent flights with QR nonetheless and I would gladly choose them again in the future!,Promoter

DOH-CPH-DOH-SGN on 18 Dec and 29-30 Dec. 2014. All flights on time. B787-800 DOH-CPH-DOH on B787-800 and A330-200 on the DOH-SGN leg. Food good but much less and of slightly deteriorating quality as compared to previous flights. FA's professional hard working coping and caring despite the flights were full. Economy on 787 is nothing above normal seats are cramped and exit seats cannot always decline. Gold-tier members recognised in economy (2 out of 3 times). Champagne made available on all flights. Bus-transfers in Doha still frequent and tedious and constitute anti-climax on otherwise spotless trips. New Al Mourjan lounge in Doha huge impressive but lacks personality decorations and toilets. Meals on order.,Promoter
SGN-DOH on 17 December 2014. I was smoothly upgraded by miles from their Frequent Flyer Program using â€œQCredits. This was the only leg on business class (out of 4) enabling me to compare with economy. The A330-200 on SGN-DOH business class seats are flat but not fully horizontal (only decline to 165 degrees) making sleeping horrible. Night-kit and nice cotton pyjamas provided. Service top notch and wines in ultra-top class! Food served on demand and excellent but portions have become very small recently and 2-3 dishes are needed to make up a full meal. FA's the most professional alert and caring I have experienced for long time. Now 4 beers to choose among and the 2 champagne offered are exclusive though still beaten by some of the wines served. Cheese plates nice. Granted access to Business class lounge in Doha despite onwards travel was only in economy.,Promoter
DOH-BKK-DOH-MAN-DOH-BKK. Flew from Doha to BKK on the A380. Booked business class but got an upgrade to 1st. (Been with Qatar Airways for several years). 1st Class is nice on the 380 but I'm not convinced of its value for money compared to regular business class. Food was 'so-so' although choice of beverages is excellent. Cabin crew were wonderful as always. Flew the A300-200 from Doha to Manchester (UK) business class and this plane is really showing its age now. Seats are not that comfortable for a 7 hr flight and again the food was only just adequate. I think they must have changed caterers because only a year or so ago the food was always excellent.,Passive
Per-Doh-Mad November 13 Jo'burg-Doh-Perth. All flight except Jo'burg - Doha on 777. The standard of service in business class on all flights was very good. The best being the Doha - Perth flight were the flight attendants were particularly attentive. All food on all flights was excellent. Again the food on the Perth - Doha flight was particularly good. Found the 787 seats from Joburg to Doha more comfortable than the 777. You did not need a mattress on this flight as the seat in the lie flat position is so well padded. I love the pod with the extra table room and the shoe storage area. Even with the mattress double thick on the 777 you can still not sleep comfortably on your side. Did not have this problem on the 787. All flights were on time or early. Not a huge fan of the new business class lounge at Hamad Int'l. Not as well designed or sign posted inside as it should be. The seating is great but the design does not flow for me. Will continue to fly with Qatar as they offer one of the best business class products in the air.,Promoter
Flew KUL-DOH-CDG-DOH-KUL. Two flights from and to KUL was operated by an A330-200 while both the flights to and from CDG was operated by their all new A380. First leg was a night flight and the crew was fantastic! They were friendly smiling all the way and nit showing the rushing face even though it was quite a full flight. Food and beverages good portions not too small and had a wide selections of beverages as for IFE selections was ok for adults but for kids not very much. On all the other 3 legs crews were very robotic but did their job. The A380 was a great plane seats were spacious enough and modern. Noticed food catered from DOH not that good but still edible... Pilots on all flights landed perfectly but they seem to be mumbling all the time. Price of tickets were very reasonable and affordable. Thumbs up for Qatar Airways!,Promoter
"Perth - Doha - Manchester 14-15th December 2014. Perth - Doha flight - usual B777. Full flight but cabin crew maintained a good friendly service. Have used Qatar over last few years on this run. Standard of food has gone down quite noticeably and beverage service not as frequent as in past (although a full flight could explain this). IFE very poor and aircraft seemed ""grubby"" (clean but well used). Doha - Man. Airbus 330. Seats tight in width but good IFE aircraft appeared very new. Flight 2/3rds full but cabin service was very poor. Cabin crew sullen only appeared at food serving time and seemed to spend rest of flight sitting on their crew seats looking very unhappy (they did not even appear to chat to each other). Certainly the worst long haul cabin crew i have experienced (the one exception being Iberia on a trip to Argentina). Maybe this was a one off but certainly I will now consider an alternative airline for this run.",Passive
I recently flew from Perth to Paris. The attendants were lovely and the food wasn't bad (it has certainly improved since my first Qatar flight). However the movie selection was dreadful as usual. I do not understand why they can't have a good selection of recent releases as all the general movies they show have been seen 100 times! The flight from Doha to Paris was great - comfortable and I love the new Doha airport. Despite the IFE I would still travel to Paris from Perth on Qatar because they have really great take off and landing times both ways.,Passive
KWI-DOH on newly refurbished A320 with 2-2 lie flat seats angled toward the windows. Great if US carriers could copy this modely especially for coast-to-coast travel in the US. Service was obliging for this one-hour sector. Connected in DOH to IAD on a 777-300 and was in seat 6K. Overall service was good but somewhat slow due the chief purser having to spend an inordinate amount of time dealing with one selfish and disruptive passenger from Qatar who insisted on bringing his toddler up from economy even though the child not was ticketed in business. He loudly argued with the flight attendants including telling them that he was friends with the Qatar Airways CEO. The chief purser handled the situation admirably and the child was eventually taken back with his nannies in economy. This overly entitled passenger though the plane was his own and that he could do as he liked. Food was good. Call button not always answered very promptly. Washroom kept clean. A great product overall.,Promoter
Flew Dubai-Doha-Colombo with my wife and child in economy. Overall OK food was OK options finish quickly and you have to manage with what is available. Leg room was OK restricted due to entertainment box under the seat. Few things that they may need to look into: Check in staff at Dubai yawning at 8am in morning not as welcoming as we expected. Doha-Colombo sector too cold inside the aircraft for many passengers but repeated request by us to make it a little warmer did not yield any result. Aircraft was clean and well maintained good entertainment system and options. This was 1'st Qatar airline experience will fly them again but not worth becoming loyal to them.,Passive
"Have used Qatar a number of times for Manchester to Perth via Doha and return always in economy. Sunday 14th Dec 2014. First leg on a full to capacity 777. The cabin crew were excellent in dealing with a full aircraft but the IFE was very poor and limited in choice of films. Also I feel that the standard of food served has fallen considerably. The aircraft itself looked ""tired"". The leg Doha to Manchester in an A330 was a contrast. Very nice aircraft with good IFE food still of a very average standard but the real difference was the cabin crew. I got the distinct impression that we were a nuisance and interrupting their rest time. No smiles indeed they were quite sullen and spent most of the flight sat on their seats by the galley not even chatting to each other. I doubt very much that I will use Qatar again.",Detractor
We flew Bangkok to London return. So with a change in Doha 4 different flights and they all vary. The flights to London were good and especially the first leg with excellent service from the staff. Good food too. But the return was less good. Especially the final leg Doha to Bangkok. We left Doha around 1am and it would have been nice to get a good meal to settle us down for the 6 hour flight but they just brought us a miserable sandwich. 2 hours before arriving into Bangkok - around 10 am - I expected a nice breakfast - nothing too heavy - but the food options were dinner-based - so beef or chicken with veg etc. I think we just wanted eggs or croissants with coffee. I've flown with Qatar many times and I find the service quite variable. The stop-over in Doha bus connections is now a drag.,Passive
Flew NRT-DOH-JNB return. The leg between Tokyo to Doha was on a 777. Quite comfortable. Service was excellent and the staff very attentive. The crew definitely put in the added little extra attention that makes the difference. Aircraft very clean etc. Trip from Doha to South Africa on the 787. While this aircraft is rather impressive I found the entire experience heavily marred by the presence of the entertainment box under the seat in front of you. This can really make it nigh on impossible to get into a comfortable position. I had read the reviews and didn't think it would be such a big deal. At the beginning it isn't but after some hours it starts to become a problem. On the way back I was actually relieved to get off the 787 and onto the 777 for the trip to Tokyo. Having said that the service on the 787 was of the same high standard that made up for the seat discomfort caused by the entertainment box. All in all the airline itself is excellent and the service quality very high. Qatar definitely deserve the 5 star rating that they have. Would definitely fly Qatar again definitely. But would try to avoid the 787.,Passive
LHR-DOH-PER-DOH-LHR. Flew the 4 sectors on 777-300 ER recently in Economy. They do a lot of things very well but Seating Inflight Entertainment and Beverages really harm their efforts. Seating is reasonable but what a nonsense on all 4 sectors the recline was! Goes back much too far clears any food and drink off of the table into the lap of the person behind I saw it happen twice and had a very narrow escape myself! When food and drink are not an issue the screen on a fully reclined seat is too much in your face. Drinks were infrequent and if you ordered a Spirit mixer eg. gin & tonic they mixed it for you (in varying strengths) rather than give you the standard small spirit bottle and separate mixer. Small point but again not 5 star standard. Inflight entertainment was good but not great. These are like for like comparisons if the price and schedules are better with Qatar then you may prefer to overlook these issues. Drinks and IFE are small irritations but compared to others they are falling short.,Passive
I flew London/Dubai and return via Doha in economy class. All 4 legs were on-time or even early! Apart from the Doha/Dubai leg the other flights were only half full so people could spread out and have the centre 4 seats to sleep. However I really would not say it is a five star service! The meals were OK nothing special and the portions not that large. The inflight entertainment was very good in my opinion. No amenity kits with socks or eyeshades for a 6 hr flight! On all 4 legs I found the crews very well groomed professional but not exactly warm and friendly.,Passive
Booked MAN-DOH-HKG return. DOH-HKG operated by CX so this review refers only to the MAN-DOH sectors. Outbound flight in a modernised A330 with a much smaller IFE box under the seat (makes a big difference to leg room) return flight in an older A330 with the much-larger IFE box and the older-style IFE interface. Leg room not an issue as both flights were half-empty so I had the whole row to myself. Seats on both sectors were very uncomfortable: I always found them comfortable before and the seats look quite new so I suspect that cheaper/uncomfortable seats are now being installed. Cost-cutting and deteriorating standards are now evident elsewhere: tray tables not properly cleaned less food than on previous flights (and worse quality) poorly maintained toilet facilities and very unhappy-looking FAs on both flights. Online booking page kept returning server errors - I tried to make changes to my schedule on several occasions back home as well as in Hong Kong with similar errors noted in both countries. I'm hoping that all this was just a one-off or perhaps QR's previously flawless service has led me to expect too much. But for the first time I didn't enjoy the flights that much at all. It won't stop me from booking with them again but if this situation continues I will definitely consider switching to another carrier for my flights to east Asia. However both flights were early and the fares were excellent value even after paying for a change of flights.,Passive
QR707 DOH-IAD. Got on board and after an hour informed that the overhead lights don't work and that the crew had informed ground personnel about the problem before push back but that nothing could be done. I would have appreciated being informed by the crew when they introduced themselves that there was a problem with the overhead lights particularly given that it is a daytime 14-hour flights when some passengers may wish to work. Service on board was good. Food was very good well presented and prepared and very tasty. Flight departed on time. Check in easy with lots of staff to greet and provide directions.

CGK-DOH-LHR first time flying with Qatar. Selected them solely based on good reviews and 5 star status and wanted to try their new A380 to LHR. CGK-DOH leg was in a B777-300ER quite a new plane great IFE with very big screen on time departure and early arrival in Doha very good inflight service as well. Our flight to LHR was delayed by 2 hours due to aircraft changes. It is no longer A380 but they changed it to an old A340-600 to make the matter worse despite checking in on time and getting our preferred seats (window and middle seat as we are a couple) due to the aircraft changes they put us in the middle seat of 4 between 2 other strangers. The seat layout is 2x4x2 why cant they just put us as a couple in the window/aisle seat? Aircraft is showing its age and entertainment is limited unlike the B777 service was so-so and meals are inedible. Very cramped seats and legroom is not that great compared to B777. They changed the gate twice during the delay and we had to walk from end to end at Hamad International Airport just to find out that our flight was delayed. Not a very good experience especially considering DOH-LHR is one of QR's flagship route.,Passive
"LHR-DOH-CGK CMB-DOH-LHR. 4 sectors on 777/A330/A320/A319 respectively. 777 was superb for comfort - crew overly attentive but not actually good at delivering anything that was asked for. A330 not as good as the 777 and feared the angled flat seat and then had the best night's sleep I've had on a plane! Best flight of the lot for service and food. A320 CMB-DOH with a regional business class seat for 5.5 hour flight worst flight of the 4 despite a lovely crew. Just not a suitable seat for that length of flight - the 2 other flights from CMB are A330 and 777 with a ""proper"" business class seat. I wouldn't do this flight again but it did work with the schedule I needed. Delayed and therefore missed my connection in DOH as India closed it's airspace due to a missile test. Not Qatar's fault and very well handled was re-booked before I checked in on to the later LHR flight. A319 all business class. Comfortable seat OK food not a great crew overly attentive again and far too many announcements. Felt claustrophobic in such a small plane for a 8 hour flight. Suggest QR get a widebody on that flight and make some more money with economy passengers and cargo - would be better for everyone! Overall not a bad experience a good price and I would fly QR if the price and schedule worked.",Passive
"Flew PHL-DOH-CMB on Nov 30th and Dec 1st. First time on Qatar. The PHL-DOH flight QR-728 in a 777-300 with bad in-flight entertainment systems.

Flight crew promised to ""reset"" my system after completing inflight meal service but never did anything or came back to inform me.

IAD-DOH-KWI business class on Nov 9. At check in IAD I asked the agent if there were any infants seated in the first economy bulkhead as I was in the last row of business class. He said there were two infants booked on the flight but both were located at the back of the aircraft. An infant which screamed for the first two hours of the flight was located right behind me. At check in there was an empty seat in the first business cabin that I would have happily taken had I known an infant was seated behind me. Onboard I called the Chief Purser and complained to her. She agreed that the check-in agent should have told me and was going to follow up. At check in there is no reason why the web-check in baggage drop only counter should be closed before the entire check-in counter closes. I ended up behind a huge family traveling in economy with mountains of bags who checked in at the business counter and haggled endlessly over excess baggage charges causing me to wait about 15 minutes to check in - all the while the web check-in counter was unattended. I had a delicious lamb entree from IAD-DOH although the piece of meat was the size of a silver dollar. New lounge in DOH is pretty nice. I had a shower which was available as soon as I asked. Well equipped lounge with lots of dining options and very spread out. DOH-KWI was on the new 787. The interior of the cabin is cool with great ambient lighting and seat comfortable. I like the sparkling rose before take-off. I wish the sector had been a bit longer to enjoy it more. All flights were spot on time.,Promoter

Have been a regular on Qatar Airways during last 3 years on Delhi-Doha-Lagos. Travelled in Economy and Business. Experience in economy is mixed. Seating is ok in 2x4x2 configuration but less keen on the 3x3x3 configuration which seems cramped.

First time flying Qatar Airways from Paris CDG to Kuala Lumpur via Doha return. First leg unsatisfactory as the 2-2-2 cabin felt quite cramped. Staff forgot my main course but apologised and this was quickly sorted out. At the lounge in Doha there was a wait for the shower but staff were efficient and I got a shower room within 15 minutes. Doha to Kuala Lumpur was excellent. Great service onboard. Return trip KL to Doha similarly good. However food was at best only average on these flights. Doha to Paris was in first class. On arrival in Doha the lounge was the same as the previous - no separate first class lounge. Another wait to have a shower but this was quick and got a shower room in less than 10 minutes. Service onboard the Doha to Paris flight in first class was excellent. The stewardess was attentive and efficient. There were no other passengers in the first class cabin so I felt really pampered. Unfortunately the food was only average and the entertainment channels were not that great. Pity as the service onboard was top class. I also noticed that the advertised chauffeur drive from the terminal to the plane for first class was not made available to me. Overall I find Qatar Airways provide great service onboard but I would have some hesitation flying with them in the future for a few reasons. Firstly I prefer airlines that offer Business Class seats with direct access to the aisle. Secondly the lounge while impressive should have more shower rooms to cope with the volume of passengers. Thirdly Qatar does not provide a limousine service to and from the airport. Finally the food and entertainment onboard should be better. For flights to and from Kuala Lumpur the option of Malaysian dishes should be provided. The choice of music needs to be revamped. I will be comparing prices with other airlines closely before deciding if I would fly Qatar Airways again. I would recommend it for their excellent staff onboard but the service on the ground can be improved.,Passive
Finally I get to fly on the Dreamliner! And Qatar Airways made the experience world class. As you board the plane you notice your first difference. The entrance of the 787 is very open and grand. You nearly feel like you're walking into a lobby area. Then you notice the windows which are truly big. Love the expansive feeling you get by being so connected to the outside. When you finally get to the new business class seat which has a very spacious 1-2-1 configuration you realize why Qatar is one of the few 5-star airlines. The reverse herring bone layout has you facing into the large windows and has by far the best design I've ever seen given this configuration even in sleep mode. An excellent dining experience. If there is one slight doubt it's with the new IFE system which takes some time getting used to. It's a complete redesign and not always logical. At least to me. Did I mention the spacious lavatories? Their Dreamliner experience is perfection.,Promoter
Heathrow-Doha-Ho Chi Minh B777-300ER and it was a pleasant and a comfortable journey. Great cabin crew very friendly and polite. The food onboard seems less then last time in 2013 and that was a bit disappointment. Transfer at DOH beautiful new airport great design. Flight from Doha to Ho Chi Minh with the A330. The IFE onboard seems pretty old old seats and no touch screen. Many movies but not so many movies in the action category. SGN-DOH - Pleasant and an enjoyable flight. Landed on time. The problem was that my next flight to Doha- Oslo was leaving 9 hours later so pretty boring to wait so long. Great restaurant and food in the airport. B787 for the next flight. Good flight but I found out that the music didn't work and played different songs to those selected. Food was ok but I wish it was more. I sat on the back and didn't get my choice of food but that was ok. Landed on time at Oslo. I do recommend Qatar Airways.,Passive
Superb service with Qatar on business class. The only downer is the lounge in Paris which is shared with a few other airlines and offered only packaged snacks and a few sandwiches. Inflight - so nice to be able to choose when we wanted to eat. The food was fresh and delicious and presented to us whenever we wanted. The service could not have been better. Yes and pyjamas and the extras too. Qatar were superb in every way (did I mention the Krug at the lounge in Doha?) If only they flew into Adelaide!,Promoter
TBS-DOH-MXP. Both aircraft's seemed relatively new but the heating made it unbearable (especially on the TBS-DOH leg). It felt like a sauna and even the crew agreed but couldn't do anything about it. The vegetarian meals I ordered were not inspiring. The light snacks are a piece of sweet and a piece of savoury. The savoury was just OK the sweet was dry and burned i.e: inedible. On board Staff were miss and go. Most of the crew (Asians and Arabs) were friendly and genuinely eager to please but some of the Eastern European ladies were cold and not very approachable. Doha Airport is new and impressive. My connection was 5 hours long and so I went to the Ortyx Lounge that charges around $40 (140QR). The Lounge was very busy (500+ people) and there is only one shower facility. Luckily I found a slot to shower else the onward flight would have been even more awful than the first. I was happy to got an emergency exit seat (10D) on the DOH - MXP flight to discover this was the worst possible choice of seat. It is on an 'angle' and so it provides even less legroom than the regular seats with people going in and out of toilet and the crew bumping into me non stop.,Passive
Manchester - Doha - Bangkok. Check in at Manchester excellent as usual given pass to Escape Lounge which in all MAN-DOH-DPS and BKK-DOH-MAN. Took these flights a couple of weeks ago and on every one of the 4 flights the service and the food were indeed 5 star quality. The service in the business class lounge at Doha was also excellent. The only gripe I would have on the flights is that the choice of movies is very poor - Premieres and recent releases I really don't think so.,Promoter

Manchester - Doha - Bangkok. Check in at Manchester excellent as usual given pass to Escape Lounge which in all honesty isn't the best I've been in but as it was almost empty its OK to while away an hour or so plus they come and tell you when your gate is open. Unfortunately the usual carryon once in the departure area of people standing directly in front of the doors despite being told to sit down and wait for the announcements a few passengers tried to follow the wheelchairs through the doors. Priority boarding for business class and silver card holder resisted the temptations to smirk at the clowns still blocking the doorway and headed for the business cabin within a few minutes of boarding a flight attendant had already take my order for a drink so settled down and waited for takeoff. Bangkok to Doha is on Airbus 300 which I actually prefer to the Boeing 777 the cabin is smaller and I think more comfortable senior flight attendant introduced herself to all passengers and we then took off on time. Flight was very pleasant little turbulence so managed to consume all meals watch a few video and doze prior to arriving in Doha. The usual excellent Qatar staff advised on leaving the aircraft that you didn't need a pass for the lounge just to show your boarding card but as I was only in transit for 90 minutes I didn't have much time to spend there. Doha to Bangkok is on the 777 were the economy passengers have to troop though business so it seemed to take ages the cabin was hot and I don't usually feel the heat and stunk of perfume changed in the pyjamas (am I the only person who does) and tried to get some sleep prior to arriving Bangkok were the cabin crew handed out fast track passes on departing the aircraft. The return two weeks later was again a fine flight on both legs of the journey the only problem of your outward / return flight being in the same month is you have the same movies so stuck to the TV shows I'd missed spent almost 9 hours in transit in Doha thankfully the new brilliant new business lounge is open. Between Doha and Manchester I got a nose bleed and within minutes a was being tended to by 5 crew members with tissues towels and a bag of ice. Throughout the rest of the flight whichever member of the flight crew that passed checked I was OK or if I needed anything. I've seen some recent comments that Qatars very high standards have slipped quite a lot my experience is the complete opposite I've always believed their product to be vastly superior to their rivals in the gulf and nothing on my trip has changed my opinion that Qatar have by far the best cabin crew and ground staff around. I've already booked another two flights with my favourite airline.,Promoter

PER-DOH-FRA with return CDG-DOH-PER. All flights on 777-300ER except DOH-FRA which was an older A330-300. This was our first time with QR (would normally use SQ or CX for this type of trip)and we were quite impressed with the overall economy service. Planes were quite clean and well maintained although the A330 was definitely showing its age. We found all staff to be professional and in general were quite friendly even if smiles were a little limited. The economy food was surprisingly good and varied plus of decent quantity. Alcohol limited without asking but always available. Call buttons seemed to get quick attention from what we observed. All flights on time or early except for one which was only 20 minutes late. I found economy seat comfort and legroom acceptable despite being 192cm tall. Very happy the QR 777 is 9 abreast and not the 10 across that some others try to squeeze in. Connection in DOH was a breeze (we had over 2 hours each way). Based on these 4 flights we are happy to recommend QR and will include them in future considerations.,Promoter
Travelled BKK-DOH-EDI on 10 Sep and was impressed with all aspects of QR. Use of THAI lounge at BKK is a real let down. Inflight service excellent. DOH Business Class lounge excellent. Returned EDI-DOH-BKK on 15 Oct. Flight departure delayed by 1 hour which caused some anxiety given a 1.5h stopover. But this was made up so there was a 55 minute stopover allowing us and our luggage to connect successfully. Inflight service on both sectors excellent. Boarding at DOH chaotic with no accessible separate boarding at gate for Business. Food is OK but not exceptional. But any downsides are certainly made up for by service which is above and beyond.,Promoter
DXB-DOH-BCN. October 13rd. Overall a good product but I have yo admit nothing exceptional. First leg DXB-DOH was ok onboard a new A320 transfer at DOH was smooth and efficient thanks to the excellent PC Gold and Business class lounge. However ground staff was very disorganised looking like headless chickens. Second leg onboard new A330-200 ok but food was just awful. New 330 seats are also quite cramped. Both flights on time. Definitely a right choice.,Passive

Flew outbound SIN-VIE return ZRH-SIN both transit through Doha. In-flight services and entertainment were good however food were below average for a premium airline. Seating arrangement on the Dreamliner economy class were 3x3x3 found it inconvenient for couples especially seating by the windows. Seating space were just okay for small built any taller than 1.75m might be a tight squeeze. Our inbound transit at Hamad Doha were from remote parking bay. Although bus shuttle to the terminal were smooth we were quite disappointed that such a premium airline felt very much budget oriented. The only consolation was we got the tickets cheap during promotion. The saving grace was flights were punctual for all 4 sectors which is very important to any traveler.,Passive
My wife and I flew GRU-DOH-SIN on 21/07/2014. The first part GRU-DOH we flew out on a 777-200LR it was clean inside and we loved the full flat bed. The other part DOH-SIN on their new 787 a first time for me on the Dreamliner excellent airplane. Very good seat pitch and width. We had a excellent staff service in both parts. Flight attendants readily and frequently serve you drinks or snacks. Food was tasted fresh and the best airline food we have tasted quite frankly.,Promoter
Decided to travel Business Class SGN-FCO-SGN last summer holidays (May/June 2014). The experience was great. Hubby and me + 3 kids aged 8 months 5 year-old and 9 year-old. All the crew were really helpful with the kids. They even allowed my baby to sleep on the unused seat. I cannot imagine how tedious it could be travellling with 3 kids but surprisingly everyone in my family was more than comfortable flying Qatar Airways. Will definitely use Qatar Airways again.,Promoter
Fairly disappointed. First class seat was narrow (much smaller than others like LH LX on the same aircraft type). Crew not proactive need to request everything. Food mediocre (compared to Asian airlines in F) no pyjamas no F lounge in DOH (C lounge was relatively good food offerings look impressive but everything is pre-cooked and dried out. Entertainment system needed rebooting and was unreliable.,Passive

Edinburgh-Doha-Male return. Check completed in under five minutes but surprised no fast track through security Qatar use the No 1 traveller lounge adequate but nothing special. Boarding was quick and staff apologised for small delay whilst a family with young children boarded in front of us. We flew the Dreamliner and had chosen window seats specifically with my partner seated directly behind me. Seat was very comfortable and the general cabin ambience was excellent the cabin layout is 1x2x1. Served a very nice rose champagne after boarding food choice of wines and entertainment all very good. Crew excellent and very attentive flight departed on time was a bit concerned as we had a fairly tight connection but we arrived early into Doha - security was a breeze with a dedicated Business class area and we passed through in under 5 minutes. Had time to make a quick visit to the new lounge and very pleasing on the eye. Onward flight was on an A320 with the newly refurbished cabin seat excellent and very comfortable - even managed a few hours sleep. On arrival and departure from Male they now have a fast track desk for Business class passengers. On return through Doha Business class immigration processing took around 20 minutes the queues for Economy were fairly large and doubt those in that queue would clear in anything under an hour. Checking in at Doha on the return was very quick and Hamad Airport pretty special small queue in front of us so asked to take a seat for no more in 2-3 minutes and a staff member came over and assisted us with the bags to check in. Had more time to see the new Al Mourjan Lounge this time it's very large good choice of food and lots of seating although at 06.00 it was very busy. All in all great experience and would have no hesitation flying Qatar on future trips.,Promoter
Flew PER-LHR in Economy early August 2014. Aircraft PER-DOH B777ER. Plane was fairly new clean and comfortable a good flight. DOH-LHR was supposed to be a B787 but was changed to an A340 with no notice. Originally selected 2 seats together (window and aisle) these were changed to 1 window and 1 middle row several rows away. Only found out at online check-in. Managed to get 2 seats together with negotiation with other passengers. Cabin staff did not assist. Return LHR-DOH again supposed to be a B787 was changed to a B777ER. Plane still OK but older. Again seats changed (2 together this time) with no notification and further back than originals. Food a little better than average and cabin staff attentive. Seat leg room good but seemed hard. Overall a good airline- Doha airport is big and roomy but few places to get coffee if you have a wait. No alcohol but that is expected.,Promoter
Doha - Manchester A330 seemed to be a new plane very clean and seat material bright and comfortable. Business class was full. Took off bang on time and was informed that dine on demand was available. When looking at the menu it seemed that there was only a choice of snacks or omelette and chicken sausage. Companions IFE did not work and had to be reset four times. For a seven hour flight I was very disappointed with the food offered. Flying to Thailand in February 2015 I will not be using Qatar for this journey.,Passive
Qatar Airways has really gone downhill at least from the UK. I have flown with them several times to Asia over the last 8 years and it was OK but last week I went to Dubai via Doha. Unless I have got a lot bigger the seats are cramped and uncomfortable and designed so that when the person in front reclines you have hardly any room. The food was average too. Then I had only one hour to change at Doha and had to literally run to get my connecting flight to Dubai as the airport is quite big. Exhausting. On the way back the check in lady at Dubai told me the flight was quiet (it wasn't) and again the seats were really cramped so much so my leg ached. The inflight crew were bossy and you very much were made to feel like a second class citizen in Economy. They couldn't even serve you a cold beer. I will book Emirates next time.,Detractor

HAN-BKK-HAN on Boeing 777-300 on 1 and 4th October 2014. Flights on time. Check-in in Hanoi and Bangkok smooth and excellent. Lounge access without problem (as gold card holder). Lounge in Hanoi suffer from dormant staff busy with own activities but the airport view is gorgeous and food is plenty though mainly industrial. Onboard recognized and nourished as gold member. New wines in economy and for the first time after 50 flights with QR they changed the beer to Foster from the usual Heineken. So a boring brand replaced by an even more boring brand. However hot snacks were tasty service on board excellent and caring. From BKK till Hanoi 3 days later I was upgraded to business class by 8 only Q-credits (from Privilege FF-Program). What a pleasure in the Airport as fast track gives you better service. The Lounge (they use Thai Airways lounges) was very spacious and quiet but no wines nor champagnes were offered. Food displayed nicely but hardly acceptable except for loads of Chinese dishes (all Chinese tend to go to Thailand these days as they are not welcomed in Vietnam). The QR flight (got seat 1K in a 2x2x2 configuration) and service onboard was very very good and matches that of a 5-stars airline as Qatar retains.,Promoter

Bangkok to Manchester return via Doha 12th and 19th September. The new Doha airport is of course a great improvement on the old one but some issues still continue: checking into the flight at the gate meant pushing 250 people into a space designed for probably 100 rather an unseemly start - it wasn't possible so many of us had to wait until some had got on the plane. The privilege club silver lounge was hard to find â€“ I was sent from one lounge to the next [visiting 4 in all] before I found the right one - the staff seemed confused about who could use which lounge. Now that Qatar have joined One World I may change to Finnair as their prices and travel times are better than Qatar. All in all Qatar is a good product.,Promoter
A short SHJ-DOH return experience on September 21st 23rd. Overall a very good product excepted the extra-low quality on food (snacks) served on board.

My husband and I flew a promotionally rated flight(s) from Chicago to Doha and onward to Dubai on 9/14. We then returned on an early flight from Dubai to Doha and back home to Chicago on 9/20. QA is a wonderful airline and we had lots of room in the 777 for our main flights. The flight coming back was packed and the crowd was kind of unruly to board. We were in the back of the plane so among the first to board other than people with kids and first class etc. It was a 14.5 hour trip from Doha to Chicago. A passenger behind us took it upon himself to to chastise my husband for reclining his seat back. We changed seats later as I prefer the aisle.

QR060 MUC-DOH-BKK on 6 September. Boeing 787. I have flown Qatar Airways many times already and always have had a good experience. Started of rather good but then the cabin came to take my dinner order. I asked to have red wine with my dinner after take off however nothing came until I had finished my dinner. The cabin crew said that they had been busy. I was not very impressed with the service but it was only on this particular flight and this particular cabin crew that did not know how to provide a proper service to a premium customer. But my flight from Doha to Bangkok everything was excellent. Therefore on this occasion I would only give Qatar Airways 5 stars out of 10 on Trip Satisfaction.,Passive
Among world class airlines and its 5-star competitors like Cathay Pacific Qatar definitely holds its own. This past summer I took a trip from Philadelphia US to HK and the overall quality is definitely quite exceptional. The seats were comfortable enough considering the long flight the leg room was decent for economy class and the food was at least a step up from average. What stood out the most was their customer service both onboard and on theground. Flight attendants readily and frequently serve you drinks or snacks. There was a mishap in my journey in which I was stuck in Doha for a day one of the three options I was given. I will never regret it. They provided complimentary stay at a cozy hotel (along with 3 meals!) and I got to see the beautiful city. The only slight drawbacks was the longer-than-required duration of the flight (not direct route and trip from PHL to DOH was an hour late) and the arrival / departure time gap is short enough to cause problems if the first flight is late but how it played out made it worth the while. Overall worthy of being a top international airline and recommended. Will fly (am flying!) with them again.,Promoter
QR771 from GRU-EZE on 12 Sept. 777-200LR aircraft was in good condition. Boarding was organized with families with kids first and people with special needs. Then Business class and priority customers. The flight originates in Doha so there were people on-board already - they aren't required to disembark on the transit stop. Economy was around 80% full while Business looked 30-40% full. Flight attendants were great! Super friendly - handed out headphones and served a very good meal of either chicken or pasta. AVOD entertainment is fantastic - the 2 1/2 hour flight went by quickly. Bags were unloaded by the time you cleared immigration and I was in a taxi in 20 minutes after disembarking.

We traveled from Philadelphia to Singapore this summer. Flights were enjoyable both ways. Crew was excellent but at times they get too comfortable and not attend to basics - my little one did not get a toy or anything though the attendant paid much attention to one family with a baby on our flight back from Doha to Philadelphia). The first issue we had was with the transit first leg it was about 19 hours Qatar Airways did not provide transit accommodation. We paid USD 125 each to get the transit accommodation (beware of the limitation of the allowance for Meals even with this paid service ours covered only 2 meals which was not that great in Swiss-belhotel) on the return journey it was an hour and a half with long walk between terminals to security check and back to gate there was no consideration for short transit passengers. Second issue was with food preference we had 2 vegetarian meals ordered which were not offered on way to Singapore though I had talked to Attendants they confirmed our meal preference,Passive
Flew IAD-DOH-SHJ (Sharjah outside Dubai) during a promo sale in mid-May. Food quality and entertainment options were phenomenal. Movies were up to date and seat width and legroom was decent. Comfortable cabin atmosphere on the long-haul legs and good cabin service. My requests for snacks and ice cream were honored and added satisfaction to the flight. The repeated on-screen play of the menu was disruptive to IFE though. Appreciated the youth and gentleness of in-flight staff especially on the short-haul flights. Even the short-haul flights had delectable snacks. The only trouble was the since-decommissioned Doha International Airport was not sufficient to handle QR's busy network and operations. Had we not seen monitors in other parts of the airport we would have definitely missed our flights. QR's flights to/from the States tend to be pretty packed because of service to/from South Asia.,Promoter

MXP-DOH (A320 business): Flew the refurbished A320 with the new flat-seat beds. Very comfortable to sleep on but the overall lack of space (as this is a narrow-bodied plane) makes you feel very close to your neighbours on either side. Service was rather disorganised with crew going back and forth constantly. Flight attendants were not rude but tended to be mechanical - this was a general impression I had on my other flights with Qatar. DOH- SIN-DOH (787 business): Amazing plane. Occupancy was low for this sector making an already spacious cabin seem more spacious with the seats very private. Lots of space for storage and seat was great for sleeping. Crew this time was better professional but not friendly apart from the cabin director who seemed genuine in welcoming people aboard. This is probably my favourite plane so far (better than the A380). DOH-MXP (A330): old plane with average seats (inclined flat seats not very comfortable for sleeping) washrooms were not very clean - the worst leg of the entire journey. The 'highlight' of this flight was excellent service from one Thai flight attendant: helpful and friendly. Overall: I found Qatar to be a well-priced airline offering good competent service. Food was above average (better than BA worse than SQ/Emirates) but portions were small (and I'm not a big eater). In- flight entertainment was a bit limited and the touch-screen controls were not the most intuitive and responsive. Plus with Qatar part of the Oneworld alliance - there are more opportunities to accrue points. Downsides: the shared Sala Montale lounge at Malpensa is depressing.

Arrival at gate was delayed by ~ 30 min for no fault of the airline rather due to a 'hoax' which was dealt with in an excellent manner by the authorities and exceptional professionalism demonstrated by the flight crew as well as the cabin crew. Only drawback was that the breakfast served on both sectors though well prepared was exactly the same.,Promoter
Flew LHR-DOH-RGN HND-DOH-LHR. The LHR-DOH was on a refurbished A330 so the flight was pleasant with a good sized IFE screen and a sufficient selection of films. However the letdown on this flight was the catering which was a running theme throughout all of the flights as well as the attitude of the cabin crew who looked as if they did not want to work. The DOH-RGN flight was good on the small A319 which only had 60 Passengers on board this helped as it meant the crew were more attentive. For the return we tried to upgrade at the Tokyo office offering to pay however we were told that because the DOH-LHR leg was full we could not even pay for the HND-DOH leg meaning the flight would have empty business class seats. The flight however from HND-DOH was very nice as the Tokyo office sent a message to check in stating that we would like extra legroom seats which was a nice touch. The DOH-LHR flight on the other hand was terrible a downgrade from the A380 to the A340 meant that the flight was totally full and the plane was showing its age with broken seats and dirty toilets. The crew also didn't help the flight by not smiling and ignoring the call button for passengers. All in all I was dissatisfied with Qatar Airways.,Detractor

DOH-JED-DOH. Qatar Airways offers a Business Class layout as First Class on this route we flew out on a 777 and returned on their new 787-8 a first time for me on the Dreamliner personally I would call my review a mixed review. No one can fault Qatar Airways class of service they are top notch from the moment you enter into the airport to the moment you pick up your luggage and head home my only draw back is surprise surprise the Dreamliner. The way the layout is you always get distracted by the TV screens of other passengers you cannot concentrate on your reading nor can you watch something peacefully. There is plenty of storage room on the seat but the operating system of the entertainment is a little complicated. I hope that Qatar Airways review the layout of their new A350.,Promoter
LHR-DOH-BKK and back. All sectors operated by B777-300ER except DOH-LHR which was an A340 (old plane and really showed its age). QR have serious communication issues when it comes to being delayed and all flights (except the one leaving BKK) were delayed by at least 40 minutes if not more. Hamad international airport was nice and new but unfortunately very chaotic if you have a tight connection. Food was probably the best thing on QR - quite tasty for airline food! FA's really varied on each leg - some were just sitting/standing around chatting amongst themselves and were clearly not interested in customer service whereas others tried their best to deliver. Inflight entertainment was pretty good on 777s. Plenty to choose from but pretty much the same film/TV choices a month later and remote control on A340 stiff and unresponsive. Seats were a little on the uncomfortable side though lots of legroom compared to other carriers. The 2-4-2 config on the A340 definitely suited my companion and I more than the 777's 3-3-3 layout. Overall pretty average.,Detractor
One way from BOM-DOH-DFW in economy. The seats are good but food and drink offerings were meagre. I was actually hungry in the later half of the flight. Staff seemed disinterested. I was expecting. Not sure if this is a one- case scenario but was expecting a bit more from a 5-Star rated airline.,Passive
On 24/7/2014 I travelled Business Class from Melbourne to London Heathrow via Doha. The first leg of the journey on QR905 was relatively OK but on arriving at Doha with a 2 hour wait for my next flight I went to the business class lounge where I was abruptly turned away as apparently there was no room left. I was left unable to shower or purchase any refreshment and had no option but to wait at the gate for my flight. The flight was delayed due to waiting for other passengers which resulted in a very unpleasant time sat on the aircraft. The service on board was OK but the toilets were not cleaned. My monitor kept sticking and despite being reset would not function properly. I feel very aggrieved that I paid for a business class flight and received economy treatment - I have yet to receive a response to my email from Qatar Airways.,Detractor
"My family and I flew PNH-Manchester then CDG-PNH both with technical stops in HCM and transit in DOH. Generally speaking the inflight service was good but the food on all 4 sectors was bad. Passengers on all 4 flights were mostly Westerners and Westernised Asians like my family and yet the food was quite Indian Middle-eastern - oriented relatively spicy. I know that one should not expect too much from airline food but having flown on many airlines around the world I expected more from an airline that positions itself as ""the 5-star airline"". Likewise it's a shame that Qatar has just inaugurated a state-of-the art airport in DOH but Qatar Airways ground staff in DOH failed to implement universal policies that are clearly advertised in their Website e.g. to give priority boarding to passengers accompanied by young children.",Passive
Three of us flew between Cape Town and Casablanca via Doha in July 2014. The ticket price was very good. The leg from Cape Town and Doha on a new Boeing Dreamliner was excellent. The airport in Doha is brand new and there are excellent facilities for transit passengers. The flight from Doha to Casablanca was problematic. There was a 3.5 hour delay due to a faulty AV system on a rather old Airbus aircraft and the passengers had to endure a fair amount of discomfort as a result of this. The return flight from Doha to Cape Town on the Dreamliner was also delayed due to late arrival of the incoming aircraft and an electrical problem on the aircraft. The latter surfaced when the aircraft dropped passengers off in Johannesburg and had to depart to Cape Town. The food was average. Especially the light snacks were unsatisfactory. The crew members were very helpful and professional.,Passive
"I am a ""very frequent"" flyer traveling every other week on long haul flights. Last week I took Qatar Airways for the first time Madrid to Bangkok via Doha. The experience was the best business class experience I have had. The seats are very comfortable and the space between seats the largest I have seen in a business class cabin. It is true that the layout does not give you much privacy if you are traveling alone. The service and the food were excellent especially on the Doha to Bangkok flight. The only downturn was the Doha airport lounges were not available. We were given 300 Qr vouchers for food and shopping which was quite nice. Overall excellent experience.",Promoter

HBE-DOH in First DOH-BKK in Business. Firstly the positives both flights were fine although at Doha on the BKK sector flight we waited on the aircraft for more than an hour without the APU running so very hot. HBE to DOHA half empty DOHA to BKK very full. There were lots of free upgrades in Business can tell by the yellow luggage tag. Qatar should vet upgrades carefully as these people walked around without shoes and were generally noisy. Doha Lounges are a total mess that is an understatement. No room poor food service very poor. No pre boarding for Business class just get with the rest attitude. I would not use Qatar again until they sort out the new airport.,Detractor
No communication around plane type changes ie A380 due online at time of booking 340-600 actual aircraft flown with no pre warning. Munich-Doha on 787 was excellent with great seating and service limited meal choice. Doha- Kochi upgraded to first as economy over sold and all bumped up one grade. Poor service and check in facilities in Kochi on return. Business seat very uncomfortable similar to Aer lingus who are currently changing. Doha-LHR business on 340-600 instead of original listed 380. No lounge available in Doha tried to pay for upgrade due to poor seating in business no paid upgrade available. When on plane no first class service available on Main route. Limited meal available again difficulty sleeping because uncomfortable seat.,Detractor
As a million miler with one of the Star Alliance carriers this was my first time on QR and I was completely underwhelmed. QR837 BKK-DOH overnight. Business cabin half full yet call button repeatedly went unanswered. FA screwed up my breakfast (so I got none). Flat bed seat seemed to curve downward at both ends and had lots of hard metalic edges which required an additional blanket to soften. Meals were minuscule. I understand small portions on an overnight flight but if you are hungry you are out of luck. I'd heard so much about the fabulous first and business class lounge in DOH. I must be in the wrong place (even though I have been told by two staff that this is the only QR lounge in the airport). What a disappointment. No particularly comfortable seating very little privacy meagre drink and food offerings no organized system for getting a shower - seems to be catch-as-catch- can. I wonder if their famous premier lounge I'd heard so much about is under renovation or something. I expected much more than this.,Detractor
My family did a European tour so we flew HYD-DOH-LHR and on the return FCO-DOH-HYD. First the flights between HYD-DOH are single aisle on A321 feels cramped IFE is just passable but food was a big let down. We arrived at the brand new Hamad International airport so the airport experience was excellent although very quiet. On flights between DOH and LHR (on A340-600) and FCO-DOH (on A330-300) there was a problem with the air conditioning at DOH so it was like an oven until the flight took off to LHR. In FCO the flight was parked in the middle of nowhere so the boarding experience was terrible. IFE was a shocker - no touchscreens and an inspiring collection of movies and shows. The food was terrible. On the bright side cabin crew were friendly the seat configuration and space factor was really comfortable. Again on the down side: no mood lighting no hot towel no menu card and plastic spoons and forks is not what I expect from a five-star airline.,Passive
I flew from London Heathrow to Guangzhou Baiyun. The trip was the best economy class long-haul flight I have had. Starting from check in I checked in online the night before my trip. At the airport the ground staff who checked me in were very friendly. Because I had a short transfer flight to catch 1.5 hours after handing in Doha they put a label of rapid transfer on my checked in luggage. The first flight from Heathrow to Doha only 30% of the economy class were seated and basically every passenger had a row to lie down. The dining service was great cabin crews were extremely nice even though you ask them to get you another drink several times they didn't have any printed forms of menu they present you a menu on your personal IFE screen. The flight to Guangzhou was pretty much the same but with less choice of food and more crowded.,Promoter
BKK-DOH-EDI and LHR-DOH-BKK. First leg was on 777-300 then 787 and 319 from LHR. Service is first class.

The 319 from London is an excellent experience along with the impressive LHR Lounge. Overall Qatar Airways service is very impressive.,Promoter
As frequent flyer from Azerbaijan to SE Asia and Australasia over the last 15 years I'm delighted that Qatar now fly from Baku cutting out the change in carriers. Lounges: Very poor. GYD DOH and BKK are not pleasant. Emirates leave you so far behind in pre-flight care. Boarding: At both GYD and DOH when flying to GYD it is a scrum. No pre-boarding for BC and very little interest in premium passengers until we're onboard. I pay a lot of money for my flights and I expect a little bit more than QR provide here. Inflight: Staff are great service excellent movies and videos don't change often enough and food is a big problem. Many customers have been traveling for a long time before the airport and when you put us in a lounge where the snacks/food is atrocious we are looking to be fed onboard. To wait six hours for a breakfast is ridiculous given that you only provide a snack after boarding. All in all not bad but some of your rivals really are so much better in many aspects. At least you provide genuine BC seats in the short haul sectors unlike some other carriers. If Emirates started flying into GYD tomorrow you'd lose me and most of my fellow passengers.,Passive
I booked six Qatar Airways flights which were from London to Bahrain via Doha. In general I have no adverse comments to make about the economy service and the crew have always been pleasant. In fact the economy service is better with Qatar than a lot of other carriers. However it has been a nightmare on all but one flight with the air conditioning not working on the ground during boarding either in London Doha or Bahrain. As boarding takes a long time the temperature in the cabin reaches a very high temperature due to the confined space and the amount of people on board. Then the crew close the doors and still there is no air con switched on. We taxi out and now there is minimum air coming through but the air is hot not cold. When I have asked the cabin crew what is happening on these flights they always say the same thing - it is like this on all our flights and the cabin won't get cool until we have taken off. Such a shame because their economy service is good.,Detractor
DXB-DOH-CDG. June 26th afternoon flight. New Hamad Intl Airport was most welcome for this Ramadan travel back to Europe. QR lounge for Glad and Silver transit passengers in Economy still not available but this glitch has been compensated with 5.000 Qmiles and a $30 gift voucher. Good staff on both leg but food was inedible (Chinese style fried beef with rice and vegetables) just like in a bad canteen. Nice beverage selection and great staff however despite a very rude hostess on DOH-CDG leg. 77W equipment was also highly appreciated.,Passive
LHR-DOH-NBO. First leg was in business disappointed to find Qatar are still using angled lie-flat seats in business class a curse I thought has lifted from all decent airlines. It is probably easier for a customer to learn to fly than it is to find a comfortable sleeping position in these things. Another gripe the entertainment system wasn't working at all. I was happy to read but another very basic omission from an airline that promises so much. Finally despite the potential of an a la carte menu which most airlines only offer in F class (if ever) the food was completely without any flavour at all. On the other hand the fish may have been bland but the cabin crew were the catch of the day not only kind and helpful but also intelligent and articulate. Transit at the new Doha airport was easy and the building itself is stylish and functional - can't wait to come back. Finally the flight to Nairobi in economy on an A320 was great three choices of food (my vegetarian curry was very tasty) and working IFE meant I could finally catch up on two movies I hadn't been able to enjoy on the first leg. Both flights on time.,Passive
MLE-DOH-JFK: The MLE-DOH segment was on an A320 (my least favorite aircraft) but the First class configuration was brilliant and extraordinarily comfortable. I am die hard Boeing individual but the 4+ hours on this airbus were great due to the comfortable seat great service and absolutely seamless experience flying Qatar was in this segment. From DOH to JFK I was on a 777-300. Honestly every star given to this airline is clearly deserved. Staff are professional. Great entertainment (but now even horrible American carriers have it) and yes kudos on the right temperature of food and champagne (concept foreign to all American carriers).,Promoter

Pleasant trip for both outgoing (KUL-DOH-MAN) and incoming trip (LHR-DOH-KUL). For outgoing trip it was a red- eye flight at 3.30 am QR 851 (KUL-DOH) Airbus 330-200 with USB port near the arm rest. The journey was smooth without any turbulence. Two nice meals were served - snack was served once onboard and breakfast was served before landing. A small pouch was given to all passengers which include eye mask etc. IFE was nice with touchscreen features and plenty of movies and songs. The transfer at Doha New Airport was a breeze although I needed to walk quite a long way from the landing gate to the transfer screening. Next flight would be QR 23 (DOH- MAN) Airbus 330-300 without USB port. This aircraft looked a bit old but the seat pitch was much better than the previous one. IFE was nice without touchscreen features. Two meals were served - breakfast was served once onboard and snack was served before landing. For incoming trip QR 004 (LHR- DOH) at 1505 Boeing 777-300ER with USB port. Two nice meals were served - lunch was served once onboard and snack was served before landing. IFE was nice with touchscreen features and plenty of movies and songs. The seat pitch is good. Next flight would be QR 848 (DOH - KUL) at 115 Airbus 330-200 with USB port. IFE was nice with touchscreen features. Two meals were served - snack was served once onboard and lunch was served before landing. For all flights beverages were offered a few times along the journey. The cabin crews were very attentive whenever there was a request from the passengers.

Flew Qatar from BCN to Doha the new airport then from Doha to BKK on June 1 2014. I was in business class. The first plane was an Airbus 330 with Lie flat seats. The service was fantastic! The seats were extremely comfortable the monitor was quite large. Everything about this flight was wonderful. Next segment was on a B777-300 and the seats had even more room! Fantastic lie flat beds excellent service. They don't feed you like they used to but the meals were fine service was very good. I would highly recommend this airline and service. You had tons of movies to choose from that were all recent releases as well as some older ones. The inflight entertainment system was very good. The monitors were at least 16â€.

13/14 June 2014. CPT-DOH-LCA. First flight (CPT-DOH) on a new 787 I was very excited for my first flight on a Dreamliner but was rather disappointed by the poor seat pitch and width being 1.9m tall (6'2) I was very uncomfortable and unable to sleep the whole way. The movie choices were also disappointed being very old and not updated to the current months entertainment suite. Food was very good cabin crew were sweet but seemed extremely flustered. Second flight (DOH-LCA) on an old A320. First thing I noticed was there was no inflight entertainment which was very sad however it was a shortish flight so not a big issue. For the most part cabin crew were very nice except one lady who was rather obnoxious and put a sour taste in my mouth for the rest of the journey. Luckily flight was only half full so I had an entire row to myself. Extremely good fare on entire trip.,Passive

Taif to Doha 18 June TIF-DOH QR 1207. Doha to Bangkok 18 June DOH-BKK QR 822. The first leg was First class on an Airbus 321. Small aircraft and got shaken a round a bit during fine weather. The service was outstanding. Only 2 people and a family. The cabin supervisor went out of his way to please us. No Alcohol on the first leg. The second leg fro Doha to Bangkok was again exceptional service. The food was hot of and extremely high quality by any restaurant standard yet alone up in the air at 39000 feet! The cabin staff were pleasant always had a smile and nothing was too much trouble. Both the supervisors and staff on both legs should be commended for their efforts. The new airport was a pleasant surprise with no buses. No problems accessing the premium lounge Plenty of drink and food available even though it was a little bit busy. Be prepared to walk a long way to get there and to the gate. However they give you plenty of warning when you are due to board. They scan all passengers in the lounge. You should not be overlooked. Best of all was the smoking lounge where in this politically correct world we live in was a bonus. It is isolated so those of us who wish to smoke can do so in peace. Hats off to the entire experience. I will choose no other airline if it flies the route I am taking. The new airport is big and will take some getting used to.,Promoter

A dinner served after midnight was of poor quality (warm snack) but edible. Champagne offered in economy class upon request. Staff alert and welcoming. New airport in Hamad Doha is still a mess too many staff that don't know how to help lots of bottlenecks too few toilets too few lounges (many pax denied access due to fully crowded lounges). Those denied were given â€œgift-vouchersâ€ which force them to queue up for long time to actually get them. Many regional flights and â€œsmall destinations like NBO are still not accessed directly by gates but require the usual awful humiliating imprisoning bus-rides.

Six of us took the segment from Singapore to Doha followed by Doha to Sao Paulo. The 787 that flew us from Singapore to Doha was brand new and very comfortable.

Much more comfortable than we thought. Both flights have USB charging point so you can charge phones/laptops. Crews were friendly.

Degrading the Business Class experience at the new airport in Doha and Business Class passengers will no longer have automatic access to lounges at departure and transfer - I know of no other airline doing this. Under the old regime Business Class passengers regardless of their loyalty status benefited from a separate terminal that provided a very good seating area separate check in and boarding facilities. At the new airport this is currently not available and no lounge access to all Business Class passengers. Lounge is only accessible if you are a gold or silver card holder even if you paid a full price business class ticket. They indicated however that you would be able to access the lounge by the way of paying an extra fee! Flight experience on the other hand was fine. Crew is very good.

QR006 from London to Doha then onward to Amritsar (India). Flight from Heathrow was poor. An old airbus A330-200. The seat pitch was bad. Not comfortable. The IFE was ancient. The control was fixed in the arm rest so navigation was hard and you had to press it hard a few times in order for it to function. The Hollywood selection was good but the world cinema choices were poor. The food was exactly the same as I had 2 years before on the very same flight. It was tasteless. The crew were good just did what they had to. The flight from Doha to Amritsar was much better on a new Airbus A321. IFE was faster and easier to use but same movies. Arrived on time in India.

Singapore-Athens via Doha return. Mix of aircraft 777-300er and A330-200 outbound returning on A320 and 787. Night flight out of SIN so slept most of the way. Morning flight to Athens. Not a fan of the old A330 seat but overall no major issues. Return journey was evening departure from Athens on the 320. More like a regional biz seat and feels a little cramped. Seems to be too smaller plane for a 5 hour sector IMO. This was followed by the 787 which is fantastic in every sense. Again a night flight - Slept very well and look forward to being on this plane again in the summer. New airport both ways - Will be a big improvement when ready but why it has opened with 1 pathetic lounge I really don't understand.

IFE was a little unresponsive but since the flights were short it wasn't a problem. Food was up to the usual QR standard and cabin crew were friendly and professional as usual. Second leg was an A333. had an aisle seat so leg space was restricted due to the IFE box under the seat in front. IFE kept sticking but since it was a night flight I slept most of the journey. Crew were friendly and professional as the usual standard. Catering was just OK on this leg. The new airport makes transiting a breeze.,Promoter
Zurich to Doha and Doha to Narita on May 29-30. Was traveling with my wie and children (3 and 5). At the check-in we got the information that we can't access the lounge at the new Doha airport. For this reason we got a voucher which could be changed into vouchers at Doha airport. The flight from Zurich to Doha was one hour delayed. We didn't get any proper information. The departure time was shifted every 15 minutes. Once on board was surprised about the comfort in the cabin. The food and drinks were excellent. The service onboard was average. At Doha airport they were not really ready. Very long queue at the security check. Asked for business class fast track. Was not available. Then had to walk quite a long way for the connecting gate. We were flying from gate B1A. That meant we had to take a bus to the plane but first we had to wait outside for the bus. Once at the plane we had to wait outside again before we could enter. Flight was ok. Food again excellent and the service was better than from Zurich to Doha.,Passive
BUD-DOH-SGN on 28-29 May 2014. Aircraft's A321 and A330-200 respectively. All flights on time. No queues in any counters as there were plenty open. Ground staff in BUD were extremely attentive and co-operative and assisted me fully dealing with a luggage problem (my luggage only arrived to Hungary when I was due to depart after a weeks stay). WiFi not available. What was stunning was their excellent co-operation on this with the competing carrier TK. I was from BUD without demands upgraded from the cheapest possible economy ticket to business class to DOH. The cabin was almost full (10 seats of 12 taken) but service was top-notch despite I was initially not expected to be in the business class. Champagne has changed from Jackquart to Lanson. Food very good. Seats not lie flat but no much need to lie down on a day flight? Doha Hamad Airport is still in its infantry but service desks are all over the place to make up for faults. Arrived to be taken to the gates by the busses which was a first disappointment. The lounges are not fully operating: very few and crowded and short of meat-dishes showers and sparkling wine. WiFi is operating. DOH-SGN: Boarding directly from gate to aircraft ! A huge improvement from the old airport. Upgraded at gate despite aircraft was only 30% full. Champagne choice extended to include the Taittinger rose. Good food. Only 4 seats of 24 were occupied. FAs good though could have been a bit more observant/proactive. But they were all professional and comprehending. A pleasure to lie down on the seats.,Promoter
JFK to DWC via DOH. Managed to get first row economy bulkhead seats for self and wife. Found myself sitting next to some sort of bodybuilder guy whose biceps extended over into my space. When they announced all pax on board we swiftly moved over to the centre three seats and took up aisle positions with the centre seat empty. Flight was decent but the IFE was abysmal. Poor choice of movies and entertainment. We were among the first to transit the new airport in Doha - thank goodness no more buses! Marked improvement over the existing airport. At JFK we got 5K miles extra because the Silver lounge was not ready yet but we used our HSBC Premier cards to get into the Oryx lounge. Decent service clean cabins and bathrooms maintained well. Food could do with an improvement and the IFE needs a complete overhaul.,Passive
On 4th May I flew from Melbourne to Manchester via Doha with Qatar Airways. Qatar Airways is affiliated with One World so lounge access is provided at Melbourne Airport by Qantas always a good way to start a long journey. The plane for the first sector was a brand new Boeing 777 and on a full flight I was pleasantly surprised by the amount of room in economy. I am 6ft 3in (189cms) and I could stretch out quite comfortably without touching the seat in front. I was sat in 23K. In flight entertainment was excellent with Premiere release movies and a host of documentaries to help while the hours away (all 14 hrs and 15 minutes for the first sector). Service and inflight catering was excellent with a good choice of food and regular water runs by the cabin crew. Landing in Doha was probably the only negative as the airport was packed and hectic. With a tight transit time of just 60 minutes I was fearing the worst but somehow it all seemed to happen and I made the connection. The second sector of 7hrs and 30 minutes was completed in an Airbus A330 which was notably smaller and older than the Boeing 777. However the service was on par and food and entertainment options again superior. All in all a pleasant experience for what is a gruelling distance to fly. Qatar Airways deserve the recognition and commendations they win on a regular basis. Highly recommended.,Promoter
Qatar Airways provides commendable in-flight services particularly in their business/first cabins. The flight crews are always focused on service doing their utmost to ensure passenger comfort. Highlights of the airline are the newer aircraft and a strong focus on the aircraft interiors that maximize passenger comfort particularly the large overhead bins on their Boeing aircraft and newer Airbus fleet additions. Food on the flights in business is excellent with choices for breakfast indulgence (snack) and main meals with a broad selection of wines. Equally nice are the sleepwear provided on longer flights with the extra padding in the sleep covers for the business/first seats. While the in-flight experience is excellent the airline is facing challenges with the terminal and transit experience. Outside of Doha lounges were very limited although joining OneWorld has opened up many new lounges suitable for premium customers,Detractor

As a frequent flier who travels on business on average of once a month I was rather disappointed to note the poor quality of the cabin crew on both legs of my recent Business Class flight onboard Qatar Airways. The crew were indifferent cold and impersonal. There was no initiative shown by the cabin crew no greetings upon boarding or as the meal was served no offer of newspapers or selection of reading materials service was inconsistent with the crew (with the exception of the inflight supervisor) unwilling to engage in conversation. I mentioned being hungry at 11pm for a 8.30pm flight departure and was rudely told the Captain had the seatbelt sign on. Dinner was finally served at 11.45pm. The plate service does not work as between the first pax being served and the last could take as long as an hour!! Too much time spent in the galley and not enough walking the aisle. Food was good but not fantastic. The inflight entertainment offered all the choices to be expected but the navigation was a little ungainly with the mouse like cursor. The seat was similar to other airlines offering a full flat product. Happy to note that Qatar still provided pyjamas and a small overnight bag which many other airlines have discontinued. Overall my disappointment with the cabin service overwhelms what positives I obtained from a good lounge in Doha and efficient check in service.,Passive
London to Doha Boeing 787. Qatar Airways sets the standard for luxury business class with this airplane and it was the best experience I've had in many years. First class lounge at Heathrow Terminal was fantastic fabulous good great wines and nice staff. Onboard the airplane brilliant business class cabin and nice color scheme. I had a single window seats and truly private - better than most airlines first class. Meals served individually table style and food was good with a great selection of wines. Staff very efficient they don't smile much though but are courteous. The in flight entertainment had massive choice of movies and tv programs. Downside was arrival into Doha with long bus ride but the new airport is flagged to open this week and that will top this off as the best business class out there.,Promoter
AUH-DOH-LHR return. 90 minutes delay at DOH waiting for late connections/congestion. Things will improve with the new airport opening 27th May 2014. The pilot did apologize and water was passed around but it was very hot. It is hardly becoming a 5* airline to operate aircraft with defects that impact on passenger comfort. The system did not work for the safety video and a manual demonstration was provided which appeared hurried and rather perfunctory. Missed connections at DOH for myself and others and the horror of the Doha Airport transfer desk. Only the attendants on the first leg welcomed me onboard as a Gold Card holder.,Detractor
1st time flying with Qatar. Flights were from Perth to Dusseldorf. The flight was OK food was enjoyable but the list of inflight movies where old and not that many. All announcements where done in both English and Arabic which get annoying especially the videos of the same safety procedures interrupting the in-flight entertainment. All flights were delayed some by over 1 hour which does not help with tight connections. Missed our flight from Berlin to Dusseldorf for which they took over an hour to get us on the next flight which we almost missed again. Lost our luggage as well at least it turned up the next day. Our return flights were also delayed. It may have been cheaper but Singapore Air does it best. Also Doha airport is not great at all.,Passive

NBO-DOH-BUD on 19 May 2014. All flights on time. Check-in was done well - I had two tickets and 4 sectors in front of me â€“ only the first 2 sectors were with Qatar Airways but they managed to issue all 4 boarding cards thus the last two sectors were with Turkish who are in Star-alliance. Also the luggage was checked through beyond Budapest â€“- a nice touch. First leg on A320 night flight load only 60% - thus offered 3 seats in a row. Nice touch is that they offered 3 options of dinners (instead of breakfast) thus the clock was 2 am. I had red-marinated sea-bass as 1st main-course and as there were plenty of food left as many were sleeping I had rice and chicken as a 2nd main-course. Staff were proactive and I was greeted by name again by at least 4 FAs. Wines in mini-bottles and of reasonable quality. DOH-BUD A321. Flight full except 1 seat next to me. I was greeted and respected as Privilege Club Gold Card holder. Morning flight with 3 options of hot food. I chose the vegetarian omelette. Champagne Jacquart upon request. Juices and coffee ad libitum. I was explained by the chief purser on QRs new booking system which make it possible to combine tickets and transfer luggage across airlines many sectors and different alliances.

I flew on a connection from JFK-FCO-DOH-LHE. The ticket was a combination of Alitalia and Qatar. Excellent flight from JFK with Alitalia very impressed with their new business class. Of course when I arrived in Rome it was the traditional European lounge which was decent for a 3 hour layover. I have been flying Qatar for the past 6 years now. As soon as the flight was announced for boarding I didn't pay attention at that time Qatar airways ground staff came and assisted me to the aircraft with a very friendly attitude. The moment I entered the cabin they knew who I was and escorted me to my seat. The cabin manager then came introduced herself to me and thanked me for being their loyal Qatar Airways member. Throughout the flight the cabin crew were very friendly. 7 hours journey great food great hospitality. Landed at Doha Airport again separate terminals for First and Bus class passengers was treated very well and acknowledged by everyone for my membership status. Took a shower in the lounge and 2 hours later boarded for LHE. Again great service till LHE and enjoyed every minute of my flight. Etihad and Emirates should learn from Qatar Airways. Looking forward to their new Airport soon.,Promoter
I flew 4 long flights with Qatar Airways. Their staff are friendly and helpful. The seats are comfortable and have enough leg-room. The food was tasty and more than enough. The entertainment on board is some of the best. Even the help at the airport was great we never worried about getting to the right place. Qatar even booked a hotel room for us at a 5 star hotel at no extra cost as we had a long stop-over in Doha. This was really great as we could have a shower to freshen up and have a quick rest in a comfortable bed. I will recommend Qatar Airways to anyone.,Promoter
CDG-DOH-NRT return. Y class. QR deserves its five stars. FAs were always smiling very helpful and some of them truly friendly. Extra drinks I ordered were never forgotten. Food was above average for Y class. IFE is excellent with dozens of films and lots of languages to choose from. But I was most of all impressed by the DOH-NRT flights on B777-200: the planes were brand new seats very comfortable with good legroom the cabin is small and stylish for Y IFE perfect food very tasty from NRT and the crew largely Japanese were fantastic as well as the ground staff at NRT. Without doubt the best Y flight I made in many years. On the downside A340 were ageing organisation of meals was often weird (too short or kept for too long) temperature in the cabin was curiously always badly managed (too hot or too cold) and most of all Doha's airport is awfully crowed and dull. New airport will be a major improvement.,Promoter
LHR-DOH-BKK-DOH-LHR. On the first flight there was a family consisting of husband wife and children all in business but with a number of maids and a baby in economy. During the flight the maids were constantly coming into the business section and squeezing between the seats and using the toilets. When I asked the cabin manager whether it was Qatar Airways' policy to allow economy passengers to walk around the business cabin he said it was not but this particular passenger was listed on the manifest as a â€˜VVIP' which meant they could do nothing about it. At one level it was an excellent experience â€“ the quality of the food in both the lounges (LHR and DOH) and on the aircraft was remarkable and the cabin crew were consistently friendly responsive and effective. The Boeing 777 seats were comfortable and the IFE varied and stimulating. All of the aircraft were clean and although one of them was getting old there were no signs of wear. Qatar Airways wants to sell itself as the â€˜World's 5-star airline' but it must ensure that it behaves like one and not allow its VIPs to let their staff enjoy the business cabin without actually paying for it.,Detractor

We travel LHR-JNB or LHR-CPT regularly usually on Emirates British Airways or South African but this was our first time on Qatar travelling LHR-JNB via Doha. Online check-in was fine and worked well at LHR and the Premium Lounge at Heathrow is good with good service and decent food. LHR-DOH leg was on new Dreamliner and all-in-all pretty good. DOH-JNB leg was on a quite new Boeing 777. Service on both legs was very attentive and the food and drinks not bad if uninspiring and not as good as Emirates or SAA on the same LHR-JNB trip. Wine selection wasn't wide but acceptable. Seats were fine if a little narrower on the B777 and didn't fold into a completely flat bed which is disappointing and again not as good as Emirates but we did manage to sleep reasonably well. IFE was pretty good on all legs. Standards and aircraft on the return trips were the same but both departures from Doha were delayed,Passive
We flew last month from SIN-DOH-YUL sectors. It was a very long flight. The check-in at Changi airport was really smooth and the check in staff were really quick and helpful. The inflight meals and service were exceptional. Qatar Airways proves again and again why its a 5-star airline mostly due to their customer service cabin service and exceptional professionalism. The kids really loved the IFE inflight service and the caring staff. The transit at DOH was pretty quick and the next flight to YUL was a long one again. The cabin staff and the inflight service made our long journey a very relaxing one and enjoyable one. Hats off to Qatar airways staff. I would definitely fly Qatar airways again in the future.,Promoter
Hong Kong - Madrid via Doha. Three of the planes were far too hot the food was dire especially the breakfasts each flight was delayed and changing planes in Doha airport is horrendous with incredibly long bus journeys to the terminals and then a madly cramped terminal to deal with.

Flew with my family FRA-DOH then DOH-SIN two days later. We were travelling with our 7 month old baby. Check-in agent in FRA and DOH were both serious and seemed unhappy to have us at their counter. Both did not give any eye contact when they spoke to us. They were very much focused on assigning the seats for us and our baby. Also the food tray for one of our seats was not cleaned and had some food stains on it. But apart from this all else was excellent. They accommodated our 7 pieces of luggage FAs were attentive and were constantly present throughout the flight. Food was fantastic especially on the DOH-SIN leg. I couldn't get enough of their IFE (so much to choose from). Seats were very comfortable and on the FRA-DOH leg they ensured seats around us were free so that we have plenty of room for our baby. Can't say the same for our experience at DOH airport though. But will not comment about that here.,Promoter

Phnom Penh - Nice. Service onboard is superb. Fine food great choice of movies and excellent service as a whole although when plane is full service tends to be slow. The problem with Qatar is the transfers in Doha. It is from another age and the new airport which was supposed to be finished by 2012 is not yet in service. Thus you have to climb stairs to get into the plane and have a 20 minute ride on the tarmac before getting to the lounge areas. Still one of the best flying experience of my life. Will fly again with them when they have their new airport ready.,Passive
QR905 MEL-DOH QR259 DOH-WAW QR184 VIE-DOH QR904 DOH-MEL. Flights between Doha and Warsaw and Vienna and Doha were good completely opposite to the longer haul. Midnight flight out of MEL thought I would be able to sleep for the first part - wrong. Hot meal served about 1.5 hrs into flight sometime before cabin lights turned off. Cabin crew don't insist on seats upright at meal times so bit squashed if person in front has seat fully reclined and meals not as good as shorter flights. No foot rests so legs soon started aching 1am flight out of DOH on return sleeping when meal came so didn't get any drinks/meal until 2 hrs before landing in MEL.

SGN-DOH-NBO on 17-18 April 2014. Airbus 330 and 320 respectively. Check-in in Saigon polite but the staff (outsourced by QR to local company) at check-in was very inexperienced and pedantic and insisted on seeing onwards tickets visa etc so it took me 15 minutes at the counter. Flights punctual and service on top. All my personal preferences (seating food drinks) were accommodated. From Saigon I got an excellent dinner including 3 alternative options offered. I had a fish meal of very high class. Wines served from large bottles and several choices including champagne. IFE worked well. I was offered an upgrade to business class for 700 USD which I eventually declined though tempted. The dreadful bus-shuttling at Doha airport takes some credit away from my score for overall rating. Lounge access (gold card) smooth. DOH-NBO a bit more modest on-board service but still 3 options for dinner. Luggage arrived smoothly.,Promoter

"CDG-DOH-DWC flown April 16th. CDG-DOH was overall a good flight however check-in at CDG was very chaotic and police control was a mess. Other big black point: the ""Icare"" lounge at CDG 1 with no showers nor private toilets. Equipment was an A340-600 which was pretty dirty. A real shame. The saving grace was the good service on-board. For a change transfer at DOH was a breeze and Oryx Lounge was really appreciable. DOH-DWC: messy flight with rude and unprofessional Moroccan hostesses only Chef de Cabine did her best. DWC Al Maktoum airport seems to be a big joke.",Passive
Flew FRA to Singapore via Doha. First leg FRA-DOH was not pleasant packed with uncomfortable seats. DOH-SIN got better as they transferred me to a bulkhead seat. Return was not bad.

Another frustration is lack of options when trying to pick your seat on-line in advance. Next time I would probably go back to Emirates-Dubai.,Detractor
Flew CAI-DXB via DOH. First leg was a tired old A330-200 that has clearly seen better days. PTV is older- generation and is not touch-screen. The control buttons were built into the armest making it very difficult to use them. System was very slow and kept crashing. In the end I could not watch a movie. Dinner was a choice of chicken or fish and not bad at all. Drinks were a selection of soft drinks juices and alcoholic drinks. Service was very good. Crew were friendly and dedicated assisting passengers with young children. The second leg DOH-DXB was operated by an A320. Service was very rushed (usual chicken or veggie wrap and water or juice) but on the shorter legs no one cares.

LHR-PVG via Doha and then PEK-LHR via Doha again. These flights were the cheapest on the market when I purchased them in January and having had my first experience with Qatar last year I was delighted to book these flights for Â£450. 3 of the flights were on the B777 with the fourth being on the B787 Dreamliner. I had a window seat for all flights but would not book another window seat on the Dreamliner - there is a metal box just where your leg closest to the window should be! I was lucky in that I was sitting next to a waif of a girl who only required about 1cm of leg space so I was able to stretch my legs into her space. Service was good and food was adequate. I'm of the opinion that I get on an aeroplane to fly to a destination rather than for an extraordinary gastronomic experience and these flights did little to change that opinion. Inflight entertainment offering was good though my system did not work between London and Doha and the person sitting next to me on a later flight also suffered the same problem. In both instances the stewardesses seemed disinterested.,Promoter
The outbound leg from LHR T4 to Doha was on a very old plane (still had cigarette disposal units). My partners' TV screen did not work. Although my screen did work the control panel was permanently embedded in the arm rest - not only did this make it highly awkward to use but the buttons were not programmed to correlate to the places displayed on screen. On the return leg from Doha to LHR the plane was just as bad - plus there were no bags containing earplugs and eye masks left for passengers! The PA system was not working well and kept deafening the passengers with feedback. To top this off there were only 2 loos available for what must have been around 200 economy passengers. I would never choose to fly Qatar again.,Detractor
Economy - LHR to Melbourne. Boeing 777-200/300. Flying through middle east is slightly shorter than the traditional stop in Singapore or another Asian city and Qatar is about as good as economy class gets. The food was excellent and the drinks and snacks service which came several times on the longer Doha-Melb leg the noticeable difference with other full service airlines. That and they still give you the little toothbrush and socks. That longer leg to Melbourne is also overnight in both directions which is handy for sleeping and staying on your body clock. Oryx entertainment system also excellent although the TV shows lacked variety. For my regular trips home to Aus I'm now to looking to Qatar first.,Promoter
Flew LHR-SIN via Doha. Flown many times on Qatar always in J class. B777 is superb but older Airbus A330/340 product not as good but believe they are having interior upgrade to newer B787 style - we flew our first B787 on the initial LHR-DOH leg and it was fantastic. Could not pick a single fault and as a plane geek it truly is an amazing aircraft made the B777 feel almost outdated which is crazy as they are still fantastic aircraft and so spacious. Both were less than a month old! Qatar lounge in LHR is a real treat-up there with the BA Concorde Room in my opinion - worth getting there early just to enjoy the food wine and ambience. Looking forward to the new Doha airport as current transit can be a bit of a bore but would still chose to fly Qatar above any other airline despite the connection. Great fares and now Oneworld membership make it a no brainer for me and my family.,Promoter

Geneva-Doha Doha KL on 29th/30th Jan 2014. Embarkation at Geneva was smooth and efficient. The flight attendants were most attentive and the food excellent. Arriving at Doha and going to the Premium Transfer complex is a breeze. Food seating capacity showers it is all there and certainly a notch over most other airlines' premium facilities I would say. Had a few hours to spend in the Premium facility and time passed quickly. The flight from Doha to KL was excellent also: flight attendants present and anticipating your needs. The food very good indeed. My only problem with the Airbus 330-300 is the angled seats when trying to sleep. I thoroughly dislike them as there is not much space to put things away and one is not lying flat (I need a flat surface for medical reasons).

LHR-DOH-COK. While the outbound flights were comfortable with clean planes and reasonable service our return flights were terrible. It all seems to depend on how busy business class. From the start checking in at Cochi airport took such a long time since the person at the desk seemed to have a difficult time checking in our bags through the London. As always the business lounge in Doha was packed. The main problem was on our morning flight from Doha to London. When breakfast service finally started we were informed that only 2 of the 5 mains that were listed on the menu were available. They were a choose of pancakes or waffles. Basically not much of a choice. When I asked if I could get more fruit or muesli I was told 'No'. The snack that was offered just before landing was also very limited and nothing of interest. Overall the in-flight service was terrible. Their response to my comments about the lack of choice for breakfast was that if I wanted a special meal I should have requested one. I would not recommend flying them in any class given their poor in-flight and customer service.,Passive
AMM-DOH-AMM in economy both ways on 777 ER 300. Plane in excellent condition very clean and seats extremely comfortable with plenty of leg room for a big guy like me (I am 6 ft 2). Inflight entertainment excellent with plenty of choice. The only real let down is the food which was terrible both ways and overwhelmed staff who did the bare minimum. The buses to the plane in Doha are a nightmare and it took over an hour to board the full 777 which resulted in a minor delay. The new Hamad airport should solve this pretty soon. The price was cheap I would definitely use them again in economy especially in long haul since the comfort they offer beats out Emirates or Etihad any day. European carriers business class is worse than QR economy.,Passive
Singapore to London (via Doha) Economy on 21-22 March 2013. QR 939 (77W) and QR 009 (A346). Boarding was a bit slow at Singapore Changi Airport but once on board seats were wider than most airlines and plenty of legroom! Staff were extremely professional towels and sweets handed out before take off meals promptly served upon departure cabin crew brought drinks regularly to customers etc. Touch screen IFE on the 77W was excellent though not as many choices as their Mid-East competitor Emirates. Smooth landing in Doha before midnight. Connected to QR 009 four hours later onto a A346 - service was once again excellent with regular drinks services and meals served promptly. The IFEs on the A346 were older but choices of movies the same as the 77W. Seats were once again comfortable but this time there was less legroom and seat width. Landed in London on time and bags on the belt within half an hour. Extremely pleased with the service and excellent value for money.,Promoter
Paris CDG to Singapore (via Doha) Economy on QR 38 (A346) and QR 938 (B77L). Boarding was fast at CDG and flight left on time. Service on this flight was excellent - crew brought drinks regularly meals were served as soon as flight departed Paris and snack was give before landing at Doha and always a smile on the faces of the crew as they went around the cabin. There was leg space and seat width on the A346 but luckily for me the flight was not full and I had a whole row to myself. IFEs were older but nevertheless selection of movies were good. Extremely smooth landing at Doha before scheduled arrival time transfer to the terminal took about 10 minutes but once inside was able to connect to my next flight to Singapore with time to spare (I had a 1 hour 25 minute transit). QR 938 to Singapore on newer B77L flight was even emptier than the last so another row to myself as well. Seats wider on this aircraft with lots of legroom. Service was excellent once again towels and sweets passed around drinks came regularly breakfast served after takeoff and snack served before arrival in Singapore. Flight landed ahead of time. I would certainly recommend Qatar Airways and look forward to flying them again on my next trip - the airline is really going places especially with the new Hamad Airport set to open its doors within the next year or so.,Promoter
NBO-DOH-SGN on 29 March. Airbus 320 (3x3 seat configuration) and 330 (2x4x2 seat configuration) respectively. Aircraft's neat and in good condition. Flights on time. Announcements were good. Staff attending and try their best though rarely suggest outside the box. Priority members highly respected recognized and acknowledged. FAs hardworking and attentive call buttons answered quickly. IFE good but not of my priority. Night-flights after midnight serve no dinner in economy very annoying for me. No beer options only a trivial Heineken is offered. What a pity as the world have so much better options to offer. Doha airport still a nightmare packed and imprisoned in busses without information or reasoning. A 2-days delayed bag from my previous trip was not compensated.,Passive
Melbourne to London via Doha. Late leaving Melbourne by 2 hours we missed the connection at Doha. Waiting at Doha airport gave me time to check the departure boards and every single plane was late departing. At times there were nine planes waiting to takeoff. We boarded our plane on time but then waited 70 minutes before it took off. It was a tired old A330 clean but hopeless AV system with controls fastened to the side of the seats which were difficult to operate. Immigration at LHR was prompt but we waited for more than an hour for our bags! Doha Airport just cannot handle the increased number of flights as Qatar Airways increases the number of flights. This can only get worse until they get a second runway.,Detractor
NRT-DOH-BUD Tokyo to Doha was on a 772LR. The service was excellent with choices ranging from Japanese dishes to westerner quite nice selection of wines as well. Inflight entertainment was good with plenty of movies to chose from. Even though the seat wasn't a fully flat bed I had a good sleep and woke up rested before landing to Doha. The next leg to Budapest was on a 321 not bad but you can't compare it with the business class from the wide- bodied aircraft's. Overall I would recommend flying Qatar Airways I had a good experience.,Promoter
FRA-DOH-DXB-DOH-FRA. First 2 and last leg on 788 DXB to DOH leg on A320. Overall good experience 788 is a great plane clean toilets nice seats good IFE. Excellent wine selection which you often only find in First Class of other carriers. Food was poor no taste and little selection. That was better when I last took them. Staff were great on all flights and hopefully the transfer in DOH will one day be without busses. However: Staff in Frankfurt on check in as well as in DXB (both contracted) were unfriendly not interested in helping and the look and feel of the check in area was in both cases shabby.,Passive

Montreal Canada to Phnom Penh Cambodia. The service was more than I expected helpful crew. I had time to visit Doha at night during my transit. From Doha to Phnom Penh the flight was also agreeable but I was disappointed that no message was made for boarding. One hour before departure I started seeing people getting in line to embark. I waited until the last moment and mentioned to the Qatar staff that I didn't hear any announcement for boarding was that common practice? The staff member replied that they usually made an official announcement but this time they had not Besides that I really enjoyed flying Qatar Airways.,Promoter
We flew from CDG via DOH to JNB and couldn't have been happier! Food and service excellent. Very clean toilets. We didn't use the inflight entertainment and therefore can't comment. Bus ride from plane to terminal seemed to take forever. Premium Terminal hopelessly overcrowded when we got there without a single table for 2 in sight. Fortunately we didn't have a long transfer time on our way back to CDG and could almost board immediately. We will definitely continue to take Qatar Airways for all of our long distance flights even if it means changing planes in Doha instead of going direct. Not only is Business Class so much more affordable than other European airlines but it is simply so much better as well! Keep up the great service!,Promoter
07/03/14 Manchester-Doha QR024. 08/03/14 Doha-Singapore QR944. 15/03/14 Singapore-Doha QR945 Doha- Manchester QR023. Agree with review left by S Lloyd. Doha transit not good. Bus to terminal - poor facilities in airport (went to Oryx lounge in the hope of a shower but advised 1.5 hr wait for towels). In-flight entertainment poor. Food awful.

QR24 and QR940 18/19 Feb 2014 and return QR939 and QR21 on 1/2 March 2014. Recently flew Manchester-Doha- Singapore and was dissatisfied with the whole service. Flights outward and return were delayed. In Doha we were left in a holding area with approximately 100 other passengers with no ventilation air con or access to water in high temperatures with seats for only a dozen people whilst was waited for the nonsense of being bussed to our next flight. This happened on both the outward and return flights. Onboard staff were unfriendly and everything seemed too much trouble. Food was mediocre at best and repetitive. The entertainment system is outdated. I cannot recommend.,Detractor
DXB-DOH-BCN March 5th. Overall a not-too-bad flight experience but QR staff really showed disorganization and even lack of interest. DXB-DOH flight was a breeze. Transfer at Doha airport is obviously the same chaos Silver Privilege Club Lounge is quite grotty. DOH-BCN: A332 equipment totally disorganized cabin crew. Food was fair just fair. IFE very poor and repetitive. Arrival on-time at BCN airport baggage were delivered very quickly with PC priority respected. At least a fair value for money.,Passive
Flew for the first time with Qatar (CDG-DOH-MLE) and to be honest - I'm slightly disappointed. May be also my expectations were too high. Meals and wine cart are really very good. But the service is very slow. It's a real problem on the evening flight from Paris - it took almost 2 hours to have a dinner which is long as result - not much time to sleep. Seats are quit comfortable on A340 but not exceptional not comfortable at all on A321 (but it looks they will be replaced now). Transfer by buses in Doha is not an issue and Premium terminal is very big and provides a lot of place and different drinks and meals. What is strange: they don't serve champagne before take off in Paris but they do in Doha and in Male.,Passive
24/02 DOH-DPS on QR 944. The airline provides a high level of service with a superb wine list and meal menus. The seat on the B777 is great better for me than the new 787 one as I never travel alone and always wanted a window seat. Crew were excellent except on the short SIN-DPS. Premium terminal at Doha is fine but crowded and without enough facilities.,Promoter
Travelled with Qatar 6 times now first 4 or so were great and was left impressed. The last few flights have seen a decrease in service. Having said that seats are comfortable in-flight entertainment is pretty good food is ok but doesn't seem to change often (if at all) and flight attendants really do depend - have had really great ones and have had rude ones. I find the service a big part of the overall rating. Would fly again but not before looking around.,Passive
I have traveled many times with Qatar Airways I am never disappointed and I feel their service is getting better. The last flights I had was from JKT-DOH DOH-ANK IST-DOH DOH-JKT. All staff were polite friendly responsive and helpful. For economy class the seats have more space than EK or EY. The only complaint is transferring at Doha was not as convenient as transferring in Abu Dhabi or Dubai.,Promoter
LHR to DOH en-route to Perth. This plane seemed very new it had a good touchscreen TV and a little tablet in the seat. Good movie options clear screen and sound. Seats were comfortable and roomy I also had 2 seats to myself which helped. Service was good the food was ok offered plenty and had some lovely bruschetta in-between meals. Boarded a different plane from DOH to PER this was definitely an older plane. I was in an aisle seat and it was the most uncomfortable plane I've been on. Staff never smiled and when you asked for a drink they seemed annoyed. The food wasn't that good. On the return I had an 11 hour PER to DOH and this only bearable because I luckily had a row to myself so lay down and slept. Again staff never smiled and there was only one girl who was friendly. On the next 7 hour flight to LHR I was absolutely freezing! So much so I had to ask for a 2nd blanket.,Detractor
LHR-CPT (via Doha). LHR lounge is phenomenal. Attentive service great food modern relaxing layout. Onboard seats great service lower than usual. Very sad to see the menus have still not changed in a year. It is sad to see levels in my favourite airline dropping. No value for money. I'm looking forward to see what my return flight has in store including a visit to the dreaded bidvest lounge in Cape Town which makes a wait in the terminal more pleasant than visiting the 'exclusive' lounge. Flagship premium terminal service and offering appalling. Will switch to another larger gulf carrier from now on despite frequent flyer status.,Passive
Warsaw - Doha - Bangkok: Our first flight was really good the seat was very comfort and there was plenty of legs space . I'm very happy with this flight and nothing more to add there was good foods friendly staff and a USB charger. Bangkok - Doha - Warsaw: Boeing 777 the plane was really old and my seat had a broken audio. We tested with 3 headphones and none worked so I had to sit for 7 hours watching the screen without any sound. One of the staff was rude we called her several of times and she ignored us and walked away.,Passive
London - Cape Town via Doha and Jo'burg on 6th Feb returning on 18th Feb. Outward flight from Doha delayed (awaiting connecting passengers) which meant I missed my connection in Jo'burg. This was on South African but booked as through ticket with Qatar. No-one from Qatar to assist on arrival. SA would not rebook. Had to search airport for Qatar desk (which was in international departures miles away (and well hidden). This was highly stressful after 2 flights. Return trip flight one hour late into Doha. Efficient transit meant I caught the London flight but again one hour late. It seems that the transit for many passengers is leading increasingly to delays. Inflight service ok. 777 comfortable - 340 less so and poorer AVOD. Choice of films etc was excellent. Food tolerable but had the same chicken wrap 3 times and breakfast orange squash described as orange juice was disgusting. 3 flights out of 4 were an hour late. I would probably try to fly direct next time.,Passive

Flew LHR-CMB on 11 Feb 14 (via DOH). First Sector was on an A332. Aisle seat and IFE box was in the way but for a short leg wasn't too bad. Breakfast wasn't great. Second sector on an A320. IFE was from shared drop-down screens. Dinner was ok. Crew excellent as usual on both of these sectors. Return sectors with a long layover at DOH (I left the airport to visit the city). CMB-DOH 17 Feb 2014 was on a B777 excellent leg room but IFE screen kept freezing and restarting of its own accord. Once again Breakfast wasn't great. 18 Feb 14 DOH-LHR on the Dreamliner the reason I chose this carrier. Seat was comfortable and IFE seemed to have more choice. Crew excellent as they always are.,Promoter
QR817 27/1/2014. Food during flight very good while service was average as well as comfort of the seats. There is no where to store your glasses while you are sleeping. Drinks come only on request. Qatar Airways is not willing to transfer your baggage to another airlines. You have to pay extra or go through immigration to collect it and check in new. The infotainment is not that great. If the flight is cheap go for it.,Passive
On my third return trip from Melbourne to Munich via Doha (777 MEL to Doha and 787 Dreamliner to MUC) over the last two years I found the airline to be still offering a high level of service and comfort to its passengers.

I and my wife were on flight London-Doha-Bangkok economy Jan 8th and return Feb 7th. The flight service food etc. were good but we expected more space between seats.

LHR-DOH-CMB 31 Jan. 777-3 on both sectors has a superbly spacious and comfortable lay-out. LHR-DOH was 1 hour late giving more time to enjoy great lounge but arrived DOH 15mins early and was the best J class flight I've ever had. Catering was superb but it seems you had to ask for afternoon tea service. DOH transfer was fine: yes the coach is slow but you're sitting comfortably and you get a view of the action of a busy airport. DOH-CMB also left late but there were no apologies or reasons from captain and no attempt to make up time en route.,Promoter
CMB-DOH-LHR 12 Feb. Excellent 777-3 first sector then less good less spacious not horizontal seat but acceptable A330-3. Both sectors left and arrived late without reasons or apologies from captain which is slack. Breakfast on 1st sector could have been better and more substantial as most pax would have had very early start to get flight and lounge at CMB didn't offer much. Boarding at CMB is hectic but J class pax were told to push their way to the front! Would be better if they called you from lounge after the melee had died down. Short transfer was fine at a quiet mid day DOH. LHR sector crew very nice but service procedures could be improved - they needed reminding to serve my partner and I together so we could eat at same time. Angled lie flat seat was OK for daylight flight. You had to ask for fast track immigration invitation. J class bags came last at LHR not QR's fault.,Promoter
QR219 4th Jan. Having been a Privilege club member for 10 years I have seen the standards of service and quality of catering markedly decline. I flew Sofia-Doha last week.

Wine which used to be served in proper half bottles is now dispensed in plastic cups my request for a second glass was granted rather grudgingly.,Detractor
Flew on 12th Jan on Doha - Bangalore sector. Affairs at Doha airport are not as exquisite. Check in area is dull. No airbridges means we had to shuttle in a bus for flight that was to take off right on time. Saw Dreamliner marking near tail and had mixed feelings of excitement and fear. 10 min into seating and pilot announced some technical snag. 10 more minutes and he announced that the wind shield had cracked and we that the plane can't take off. Surprisingly QR managed to arrange alternate plane of exact make sat us comfortably and took off in an hour. Food and IFE were perfect for 4 hrs long flight. I did not miss my connection from Bangalore. Wanted to shop for a few things in-flight but unfortunately they had run out of stock. We fly for safe and on time travel. QR managed to satisfy that need in-spite of the glitch.,Passive
On 2 legs of a 4 leg trip the airline did not have enough food choices to accommodate business class passengers which is unacceptable. On one leg (Doha to London) several women who were seated in business class but had children in economy class - these children were allowed to repeatedly run through business class cabin disturbing other passengers. These passengers also repeatedly ignored safety instructions viz seatbelt signs and mobile phone regulations. Overall flights were on time and otherwise comfortable. We would also comment that the boarding arrangements at Colombo were complete chaos with no separate boarding for premium passengers - a total free for all. Finally on one leg (London to Doha) my wife's inflight entertainment had no sound.,Detractor

Flew Business class from Nairobi - Doha- Manchester this week and were very disappointed with lack of facilities at Nairobi. A recent fire meant there was no longer a lounge facility available but as premium passengers we were not offered anything in recompense. Even a voucher to enable us to get some food and drinks at the two upstairs cafes would have helped but on enquiry we were told that business class passengers were to get nothing just as the economy passengers. Thankfully the flight in an airbus A320 was comfortable and we were well looked after and the same could be said of the Doha - Manchester sector.,Passive
CPH-DOH-SGN and back 4 flights in total. Good product consistency. Crew helpful and reacting quickly on all call bells by passengers within 1-2 minutes maximum. Bar and food service great. One could though wish there were more after dinner liqueurs apart from just brandy. Rest of bar service is very good with choice of 2 red and 2 white wines of good quality even free (and real) champagne in Economy impressive! CPH-DOH-CPH 787 Dreamliner seats narrow. DOH-SGN-DOH A330 and more comfortable. Bathrooms kept tidy at all times with lotion and eau de toilette. Current airport in DOH is a nightmare and destroys the whole superb inflight experience.

BKK-DOH-BKK in Business Class January 2014. First leg was on the 777-300ER and was fine with very friendly and attentive staff. However staff had no idea about where we should go when we landed and I insisted that they were wrong about where they were sending us as we were having a one night layover. However staff insisted that we take the bus and get off at the Premium Lounge. This was of course wrong and we had to wait for a new bus to take us to immigration. Several movies were not showing on the plane but still it was ok. Personally I do prefer Emirates as they seem to have better entertainment onboard and better service. I only used Qatar cause they had joined Oneworld Alliance.,Passive

Flew OSL-DOH-ADD and DAR-DOH-ARN with Qatar. New 788s from Oslo and to Stockholm. DOH-ADD and DAR-DOH A320s. Very friendly and attentive service from dominantly Eastern European and Subcontinental crews. 1-2-1 configuration in 788 business class very nice indeed and A320 business class quite comfortable too (even though not good for sleeping). Some inconsistencies in service on some flights my oneworld Emerald status was acknowledged on some not. A very annoying aspect of Qatar service is that the oneworld Emerald status does not give you access to First class facilities and you don't get First class labelling to your luggage. This is different from other oneworld carriers with First class (at least British Airways Cathay Pacific and Qantas) and puts Qatar in an inferior position. The IFE was quite impressive (also on A320s) but did not match the latest IFE on Cathay 77Ws. Qatar provides top notch quality but I would say that Cathay is par at food and beverages but still slightly better in service and much better in attention to details. Cathay's First class lounges are very nice too its difficult to provide a comparison as I was not admitted to the Qatari facility. In summary I probably will consider Qatar to destinations in East and West Africa and the Middle East but necessarily to South East Asia as changing planes in Doha late in the evening is a nuisance when compared to flying the long Europe â€“ Asia leg non-stop after having enjoyed BA/CX First class hospitality while waiting for the flight.,Promoter
MAN-DOH-SIN return. All flights arrived on time but very poor boarding arrangements in DOH and SIN and mixed aircraft experience marred the trip! A330 is quiet and fairly spacious but was showing serious signs of age B777 was a much better flying experience with much more space and comfort and the B787 was a big let down. Despite the good mood lighting and darkened windows on the B787 the manufacturers seem to have used such flimsy and lightweight components that it just doesn't seem as if it is going to last. Plastic panels in three toilets were split as were two panels around the cabin window toilet seat broken in one sink blocked in two seats flex and creek and aisle is way too narrow. The cabin service was good and consistent throughout the food quality was mixed (as usual) champagne on flights from UK is a nice touch and decent wine served throughout remaining flights.

I booked a week before travelling to Dhaka via Doha and due to equipment needed for my project the cheapest way to travel was 1st class.In addition this was where Qatar Airways stands out is the short time between flights this was 3 hours whereas BA and Turkish was a lot longer. My experiences at Heathrow T4 were very pleasant check in was easy and the lounge was not far after security. The lounge itself was very pleasant and the level of service excellent. The range of refreshments and services cannot be praised highly enough. The airline had a cart at the lounge to drive passengers to the gate - a very nice touch. The inflight experience was great. I decided to miss dinner and it was great to just lay on a comfortable flat bed and catch a good few hours sleep. I flicked through the inflight entertainment and was not too impressed by the range of media although if I was not as frequent a traveller then the entertainment on offer would have been fine. On arriving at Doha nice to be taken to the transit area in a BMW. I was only in Doha for 3 hours but again the lounge was very pleasant and relaxing. The flight to Dhaka was in Business Class but very good all the same. The only poor aspect was the wait for baggage in Dhaka but then that's not really Qatar's fault. I would certainly fly with Qatar in future.,Promoter

SGN-DOH-NBO. Solid product. A-330. New aircraft. Flights on time. Food standards tend to slip a bit further and likewise the wines that are now cheaper and for instance not served in mini-bottles anymore. Entertainment fine. Staff good and focused on work. Doha airport still a nightmare and one waste 1-2 hours of being shipped in busses far far from terminals. DOH-NBO on Airbus 320. Aircraft new clean seat of OK space. Flight full but service and FAs created a good atmosphere much more than OK. Would have preferred proper lunch instead of breakfast on a flight from 9am-2pm. Food and wine standards have dropped a bit but still at 4-star level. IFE very good. A suitcase went missing at arrival in NBO but not only to blame QR as other airlines were involved before Saigon and obviously could only manage to get the luggage to DOH.

"LHR-DOH-PER on 27 December and back on 13 January. Dreamliner is brilliant. 777 on the DOH-PER leg not quite as comfortable - the seats are not actually 100% flat. The leg section sags which makes it hard to sleep completely comfortably. Service food and IFE impeccable. WiFi now allowed on the LHR-DOH Dreamliner and this is NOT a good idea. The person behind me was constantly receiving messages and didn't bother to turn his ringtone down. The usual bugbear of a ""scenic drive"" round Doha airport on the outward leg meant only 10 minutes in the (excellent) Premium Terminal.

Flew QR 901 PER-DOH QR 721 DOH-ORD and on the way back QR 010 LHR-DOH and QR900 DOH-PER earlier this month. Needed very quick tickets to attend a funeral in the USâ€¦and Qatar was one of the few that had seats and an almost reasonable price. That said pretty impressed with the airline. Seats had good legroom - one minor issue was the lack of adequate padding - my whole family grumbled about it considering the many hours we were on their flights. We were all a little saddle-sore at the end of the long flights - and we were using the blankets as extra padding. Aircraft's were of course newish 777's with the exception of an A340 out of LHRâ€¦IFE was greatâ€¦ wide variety - razor-sharp seat-back screens - we particularly liked their selection of international movies. I'm diabetic and the meals they supplied were fine the rest of the family very happy with their meals as well. No complaints good tucker. Cabin crews varied from outstanding to good. On our last leg back to Perth staff did their job well - if not particularly happily. I did notice they didn't run up and down the aisles with drinks every hour - but given half (or more) of the cabin was usually asleep - I can see why. They were very quick to hand over juice or water whenever requested. Doha terminal is a definite let-down - the bus trips to and from the terminal are dreadful in this day and age. Inside the terminal is very ordinary. New terminal on the way promises to be much better. Would fly them again for sure.,Promoter
Third time in Business Class from Germany via Doha to KUL. This time I used the B787 from FRA to DOH which was a great experience. Nice and cosy cabin environment which large monitors delivering a sharp picture. All seats in business class have direct access to the aisles. Service and food as good as always. Looking forward to my next trip with QR hopefully the new airport in DOH will be ready then as the long bus rides at old airport are somehow annoying.,Promoter
BCN-DOH-DXB. January 9th. A disappointment overall. Check-in at BCN was quite chaotic same for boarding. Food was low quality with small portions seat pitch was small as usual and entertainment very reduced. Big black point from cabin crew: I asked for a tooth brush after meal response: no. Transfer at Doha was chaotic: I was very close to missing my flight due to a staff member at the security point. I had to make a ruckus at the line until he accepted to let me go. Always the same plastic - flavoured snack served on second leg DOH-DXB.,Passive

We have flown Qatar Airways economy class 4 times in the past 15 months. As we are now living in Doha for work purposes 3 of those 4 flights originated in Doha. Doha to JFK to Florida and back to Doha. Our first two flights 12 months ago in economy class were very nice. Much better than the other airlines we have travelled on for international flights. However in the past 12 months the other two flights have shown a huge decrease in quality of service and a huge increase in cost. The main difference that seems glaring is the level of attentiveness from the Flight Attendants the quality of food that is now being served and the huge cost increase.,Detractor
We flew back from Delhi (QR 563) on 6th Jan. After an 8hr 21 min delay due to fog we discovered the aircraft was switched from the Dreamliner (787) to the A330. The switch in aircraft certainly extended the delay. The communication to update on the flight was terrible. Once we reached Doha we were told there was no other way back to NYC other than taking the flight on 7th Jan (QR 701). The transit process on 7th January felt was awful there was lack of communication. Once we reached the aircraft we waited and waited until the captain announced we would be delayed - ended up being 1hr 10 mins. While in the air the aircraft was new and we were lucky enough to have an emergency seat. The flight crew appeared tired and unwilling to be pleasant to passengers. Most of the food was barely edible. We landed and 1 hr and 32mins late with no apology or update from the pilot on our flight progress.,Detractor
MUC-DOH-BKK-DOH-MUC: 22 Dec 2013 to 11 Jan 2014. Business Class. MUC-DOH-MUC: Boeing 787. Seating was really nice and comfortable the inflight service was also very good all cabin crews were nice and friendly. Inflight entertainment system was also very nice. DOH-BKK-DOH: Boeing 777. The seating was really comfortable the inflight service was also very good but when came to bed time mattress was not offered the cabin crew stated that was only for a long haul flight but they do offer pyjamas. Inflight entertainment system was very good. Overall I was very happy and would recommended.,Promoter
"IAH-DOH-MAA in Y. Check-in line looked horrendous at first but it moved well and we were on our way in about 30 minutes. I found it strange though that you first had to queue up for a baggage weight check then go to the counter and have your bags weighed again. IAH-DOH was in a B777-300ER. The 3-3-3 configuration that QR uses is far superior to the 3-4-3 setup that more and more airlines are using today as the extra inch or two of width provides a feeling of much more personal space. Seat pitch at 33 inches is also better than many long-haul carriers and as we had seats directly in front of a bulkhead had unlimited recline at our disposal which made for a more comfortable flight. I was able to get about 5 hours of sleep. Two meals are served with decent taste and quality and free wine beer and spirits available. I had heard horror stories about the transit procedure in DOH but found it quite painless and it took just 35 minutes to get from our plane through the bus ride and security and to our onward gate. Boarding process for our DOH-MAA leg was a bit chaotic. Boarding starts very early more than an hour before takeoff and you are initially herded into a holding area with far too few seats compared to the number of people. You are eventually boarded onto a bus followed by an extremely long ride to the plane at which point we were held for a further 5-10 minutes. Once on board everything was fine though I found the A330-200 considerably more cramped than the 777. The IFE box didn't help but the seats were also an inch narrower and with an inch less pitch. On both legs the IFE system is excellent with a wide variety of AVOD shows/movies and games along with a customizable flight map. Meal was the typical ""veg/non veg"" option you get headed to India and quality was not nearly as good as on the IAH-DOH leg. Service by the FAs was consistently excellent with every request attended to promptly and with a smile. Qatar offers a very good coach product overall and is a superior alternative to Emirates if you are headed to Asia or the Middle East.",Promoter
Flying in Business Class from Bali - Singapore - Doha on the new 777-300ER is a remarkable experience. Qatar is definitely up there amongst the best in terms of inflight product on the 777-300ER. The seat converts into a fully-flat bed and although the layout is very open (compared to SQ and EK) given the 2-2-2 layout walking over your neighbour in order to reach the aisle is not overly cumbersome. The food and service was excellent although am not a huge fan of some of their colour choices for their uniforms. I also really liked the PJs that you get although then you realize that the bathrooms are very small and changing is not that easy. SQ for example has a much bigger lavatory up front and also more stylish. Qatar could improve on this. What I'm not a big fan of is their IFE system. It seems very simplistic trying to move the mouse around the basic user interface and the choice of movies is lacking. This was perhaps the biggest drawback on my Qatar flight.,Promoter
Munich-Doha-Perth. Munich to Doha on pretty empty 787. Lovely plane and flight. Doha airport painful long bus to and from planes. Had booked Oryx lounge which is well worth it. Doha-Perth full but service still quick. 777 not as nice as 787 but still perfectly comfortable. Overall short flight time but service not as good as Singapore air. Will try Qatar airlines again once new Doha airport one but likely to stick to Singapore air until then.,Passive
Melbourne to Doha in Business class. 777-200LR. Staff were very friendly and attentive. The food was the best I've had in Business and a great anytime style menu. Seat was comfortable to sit in and the full lie flat beds were great. My wife and I both got a solid 8 hours sleep which is testament to the quality of the seat/bed. We were also provided with amenities pack and pyjamas which we made use of. Aircraft was modern and well looked after and flight smooth. I'd say its as good as if not better than Emirates business and considerably cheaper.,Promoter
Berlin - Doha - Melbourne in Economy. A330 Berlin - Doha. Seat comfort was very good and space no issue and I'm 6'3. Food was also very good for an economy flight. A choice of 3 meals. Flight attendants were polite and friendly but because they have so many people to look after can come across a bit rushed. Doha - Melbourne 777-200LR . Seats didn't feel quite as comfortable but it didn't help that the person in front was reclined the whole way but alas so did I. Still managed to have a sleep. Flight attendants were polite and friendly. Food served while ok wasn't as good as the previous flight. Total flying time was around 17.5 hours from Berlin which was the quickest we have ever done it in and good if you have kids. One thing to mention we did have quite a few families near us and the staff really looked after them which was good to see. gave them some toys cool lunch boxes with meals in them and a little play time etc. Plane to terminal is by bus in Doha but with their new airport which is almost finished being built I think it'll be a thing of the past.,Promoter
Doha - London LHR QR001. First Class Lounge at Premium Transfer Terminal very nice but boarding process was quite disorganized. The car that was to transfer me to the plane came only after all business class passengers left to buses while I had to wait at the gate door. Onboard the A330 was new and clean seats comfortable staff were very attentive and friendly. Food was outstanding the best first class food I ever had. The greatest drawback was the IFE. Films were very poorly chosen and there was quite a limited number of them. Will fly Qatar in the future but only if they improve their boarding process and IFE.,Passive
BKK-DOH-HBE. Economy Class. It is the first time we have flown economy for a few years and will probably be the last.

21/12/13 LHR-DOH-BKK 5/01/14 BKK-DOH-LHR. What did I think of the service? In a word impressive! Now a days when some airlines seem to think of economy passengers as 'self loading cargo' it was refreshing to receive a level of service that I thought no longer existed! Very comfortable cabins very good catering and impressed with the cabin staff. Last time I flew to Asia I used Gulf Air: They out classed them.,Promoter
Flew Zurich-Doha-Bangkok in coach. What I experienced was not surprising but rather confirmed the different things I had read about them: first off the planes are almost brand new and in excellent shape. The inflight system especially on the Dreamliner is worth its name. The seat comfort on the 777 is superior to the 787 but legroom is adequate in both for a person my size (I am 176cm). The flight crew on the flight deck are very well trained. Communication is excellent. But service quality is not being lived up to by the cabin crew. On both flights we had an extremely tired and unamused looking crew. No smiles no communication. Secondly: the food! While the chicken on the way from Zurich to Doha was easily a masterpiece the meal on the leg from Doha was simply inedible. Layover in Doha is something to be avoided. The transfer ride is tiring the terminal is awful and the food court easily the worst. All over a decent experience.,Passive
24 Dec 2013 QR 002 LHR-DOH and QR 832 DOH-BKK 25 Dec. Boarding on both flights chaotic. Although staff called for boarding by seat numbers nobody took any notice.

Inflight food although served hot was not appetising drink rounds for water and juices had to go to galley and ask for them only brought through cabin once on each sector. I'll revert to previous carriers.,Detractor
Economy SIN-ZRH-SIN via Doha. Flight operations were fine helped by the mostly very friendly and responsive staff and the use of state-of-the-art equipment (777/787). The choice and quality of the food was however nothing to rave about. Whatever its length any layover at Doha is painful to say the least. This is partially due to the poor infrastructure of the airport but also due to the rather chaotic organization of the airline's ground operations. On the way back I had a 8+ hour layover. I did not want to spend this time at the airport and booked a hotel. When enquiring at Zurich airport if I could leave the airport at Doha I was informed that this may be difficult. We still got off at the Arrival Terminal and - while the waiting period (about 1 hour) and the visa-on- arrival charge was a kick in the teeth immigration was smooth but getting away from the airport was again somewhat frustrating. The airline has potential but has to improve its ground services. In any case I will not take another flight with Qatar Airways until the new Doha airport is operational.,Passive
Travelled London (LHR) to Kilimanjaro (JRO) via DOH and DAR in economy. The check-in at London was smooth. I was not impressed with the Dreamliner (787) that QR used for the flight from London to Doha and vice versa. The IFE did not work so we didn't have anything to watch or listen to. Some of the toilets were already in a mess. FAs were friendly and helpful. I should give them credit for trying to make the journey enjoyable. Flight from Doha to Kilimanjaro and the return flight were OK. The food was also average. Would I recommend QR? I would if you get the right price and if there is no choice.,Passive
Stockholm to Doha and Doha to Hong Kong and then returned the same way. During all of my flights the inflight entertainment system did not work properly for my seat and when it finally worked the screen was so scratched that it was hard to see anything. The seats were comfortable because the flight was almost empty yet the food could be classed only as average. When wanting to change the date of my return flight I was not helped at all on the phone nor through email/ website and when I actually went physically to their office in HK I was refused a change despite me wanting to pay for the difference. I cannot recommend them due to the service issues.,Passive
Flew SIN-DOH-IAD in late October 2013 on J Class. As always excellent Bollinger served. I like the eat on demand service as we can time the meals. Great choice and great amenities. On route back we had a 8.5 hour lay over and had booked a room. But the thought of negotiating immigration was not very appealing and whiled away the time in the Premium lounge. Had sleeper couches and even fresh blankets and a great shower with L'Occitane toiletries. Spoilt for choice when it came to food.,Promoter
NBO-DOH-SGN. Aircraft's A320 and A330-200 respectively. No lounge access could be granted in NBO despite being a gold card holder. Hotel provided in Doha (upon prior request) as layover exceeded 8 hours. However due to Xmas transitters for hotels were stuck in immigration queues for almost 2 hours! It has hardly worth it. However the 4-star hotel provided in Doha was OK but somehow scraped. Doha-Saigon upgraded to business class from seat 30K to 1F. The business class standards are high food options plenty and service quick despite business class became full - mainly by those upgraded from economy which was completely overbooked. Seats not fully lie flat in the configuration encountered this time. A delay from Doha was unusual long for Qatar Airways. As a result we came to SGN 40 minutes late so I lost my onward connection and had to purchase new ticket from VN-airlines.,Promoter
DXB-DOH-BCN Dec 19th. Privilege Club golden membership is really appreciable: 15 kg extra luggage complimentary access to First Class lounge in Dubai and Barcelona and Oryx Lounge in Doha and (at least when it is respected) priority boarding.

QR cabin crew did their best to make the journey pleasant with good PAX interaction). Gold and Silver Privilege Club members were treated personally as cabin crew called us by our name and gave us priority for breakfast preference (3 choices available between regular sweet and vegetarian).

London to Doha in business on the new Airbus. Our flight attendants English wasn't very good and they were not as efficient as other airlines. My dinner was overcooked and too salty. Staff were very kind and gave me a different meal. I had issues with my TV. It kept cutting out the entire flight. The beds are rights next to one and other. I was lucky as I was traveling with my husband but if I was sleeping that close to a stranger I wouldn't have enjoyed it. With other airlines you can put up a screen which you can't do on this plane. Worst inflight TV selection I've seen on a plane. Old movies and only a few new western release movies. Arrived into Doha for a 6 hour stop over and the Business Lounge is already looking very tired. Qatar would not be my first choice next time I fly. Up side: Amazing pyjamas and toiletry bag.,Detractor
Have just completed 2 very much anticipated legs with Qatar Airways Paris to Doha and Doha to Melbourne. We were so disappointed which is hardly what I expected to be saying here Used Air France La Premiere lounge in Paris although nice had limited food offerings but comfortable. Boarding welcome and crew great but meal uninteresting and veal tough. Only served with rice. It did do the trick though as required no dessert. Cabin was not cleaned prior to landing. Our arrival in Doha was delayed which meant the long anticipated use of the Premium Lounge was not met as by the time we were bussed to terminal we were told we had to board in 10 minutes. No seating as lounge full to overflowing toilets dirty and two lots of security ate into our very limited time. Back on the bus and our flight to Melbourne. Greeted warmly and seats fantastic and for us that was where it ended. For first time Qatar users we were not informed that to eat we had to request and subsequently very little food actually offered for a 13 hour plus flight. When food was finally requested due to extreme hunger and no chance to eat at Doha we were told there would be a long wait as crew were resting. Very little cabin presence throughout flight. Pyjamas offered and most passenger used them but only saw one bed made up by crew. All in all not quite what we expected and if this particular flight is anything to go on will not fly with them again.,Passive
"Doha - Oslo. Attentive but unobtrusive crew. The 787 business class seat is outstanding and the entertainment screen is huge and sharp. Such a shame they fail horribly with the remote control/user interface. It is very slow and unresponsive. Whenever I tried to pause a film it would instead jump to the middle and I'd spend a lot of time fiddling and trying to get back to where I was. Several TV-shows (new) were of such low technical quality they might have been VHS recordings. The never-ending commercials that take over the entertainment system at the end of each flight are quite annoying. And please come up with a ""do not disturb"" solution. I don't like being woken up for a meal if I'm finally asleep.",Promoter
Sitting in the lounge at Doha waiting for the leg of my trip from Perth to London. Wanted to quickly comment on the first leg. Flight very full (probably sold out) but service slow even despite this. Normally trays removed immediately but left sitting in front of us for nearly an hour. No extra drinks offered. Request for blanket never materialised. Vegetarian Hindu meal very average. Entertainment very good. Note for those looking for an upgrade: had a phone call on the day of flight asking me to go first class on following day's flight. Unfortunately couldn't do it but worth knowing it can be offered.,Passive

Onboard: Food plenty 2 options given for dinner. Drinks also plenty. Wines are the same 4 which has been offered for the recent 3 years. No options to select beer apart from Heineken. Juices few and no innovations for years. IFE on A320 (NBO-DOH) ridiculous (overhead monitors showing soap). Premium frequent flyers identified and respected by crew given some preferential options (food luggage seating). The A330-200 flights (DOH-MXP-DOH) were also pretty full. IFE good.

Taken the flight from SIN-DOH-BUC and back. Uses Boeing 777 for SIN-DOH and Airbus 320 for BUC-DOH. Overall the plane quality and cleanliness are good or above average but in regards to the facilities the USB port on the seats on all airlines seems not to work properly. It doesn't charge properly.

DOH-MAN was a great flight although slightly rough arrived one hour early and the head Flight Attendant was very very pleasant with me and made me feel comfortable despite my fears.

DPS-ORD-DPS. Our flight was delayed 4 hours out of Denpasar due to APEC being held in Bali and the airport being closed to the public at certain hours of the day. We knew this in advance and asked to change our flight a day earlier as we only had a 3 hour lay over in Doha before our flight to Chicago. Qatar assured us that the airport closure would not affect them and that changing our flight would incur a fee. We were met at Doha airport by ground staff who gave us the option of staying overnight or flying to Chicago without our luggage. As we had only two nights in Chicago we decided to fly without our luggage. The luggage arrived at our hotel the next day. In the air we always find the product and the service given very good and of a uniform quality. Our return flight left on time from Chicago with a 5 hour wait for our flight to Bali. This turned into a 12 wait as our flight was delayed. The captain made an announcement explaining the delay and apologized for any inconvenience This is the second time I have experienced problems with connections being late and whilst I understand these things happen I hope it does not become the norm. It feels like this airline is growing very fast and needs the new airport and new aircraft to keep up with demand. Their business class product is very good and we were not disappointed once we were in the air.,Promoter
Travelled on LHE-DOH-MAN flight in economy class. LHE-DOH was with 777-ER and had comfortable seats but DOH-MAN was A330 an old model with really congested seats.

Flew Business class on Goa-Doha-New York (JFK) on 13 Nov and return on 27 Nov New York (JFK) - Doha-Goa. The flight from Goa to Doha was an A321 which did not have fully lie flats seats but recliner type seats which were ok considering the flight was short and lasted only for about 3.5 hours. The service on the flight was excellent and staff addressed you by name. The food was good but it was more in the continental style. The premium lounge in Doha was superb with an excellent spread and nice ambience. The shower areas were great. The flight from Doha to JFK was a Boeing 777-300 ER which had fully lie flat seats and were really comfortable. The AVOD system was good. Service provided by staff was again excellent and they made an extra effort to make you comfortable. Pyjamas sets were provided plus Salvatore Ferragmo pouches. Food was good but again of continental style rather the Middle Eastern style which was my preference. The luggage arrived before economy class and we were out clearing immigration in no time. On the return flight from JFK airport the American Airlines lounge called the Admirals lounge was pathetic you could only get one coke water or beer per person. You could have a few cookies some fruit and some salty titbits as complimentary everything else you had to pay for. The return flight was very similar to outbound flight and same great service was provided with similar amenities. All in all a very satisfying experience and we would surely fly Qatar airways again.,Promoter
"Stockholm-Doha-Kochi (India) on Nov 26. I have done this trio many times with QR and I'm very satisfied. The new Dreamliner from Stockholm to Doha is very comfortable spacious and silent. But I couldn't see that the windows were bigger! A spacious galley with fruits cakes and an unopened champagne bottle. Plenty of space for legs hand baggage and computer reading materials and other small things at the seat. The toilet are very spacious. On the Doha-Kochi sector they have put in bigger aircraft's with ""angled lie flat chairs"" in Business class. A big improvement to the old planes on this sector. Very friendly staff competent they managed to make my computer hook on to the WiFi system onboard. In QR business class you can get food served whenever you want. On an earlier flight on the same sector they wanted to serve a third dinner on the flight Doha-Kochi (the two earlier were on Stockholm-Doha and in Doha terminal) but I asked for breakfast instead and they gave me a really good breakfast! The staff was apologetic that they couldn't give me an omelette but I tried to convince them that it didn't matter. I call that service.

MAN-DOH-BKK-HAN-SGN-DOH-MAN. Really impressed with the seats service and entertainment on all flights. World class airline in same bracket as Emirates and Etihad. Arguably Singapore Airlines still marginally superior. 777 seats wider and entertainment system better than A330 however 2-4-2 layout is preferable for couples relative to the 3-3-3 777 layout. Fortunate to be upgraded to business on the red eye SGN - DOH flight which was great notwithstanding that particular A330 being an older example. Still extremely comfortable and accommodated an excellent night's sleep. Check in for all sectors fine Doha airport bus transfers a bit of a novelty but acceptable and soon to be replaced. Will certainly use the airline again if priced most competitively as was the case in this instance.,Promoter
Bangkok-Doha-Cairo and back. All in all a very pleasant and civilized experience. Reservation and online check in and seat selection a breeze. At the airport very pleasant staff and my online check in had me bypass a rather huge line at the regular check in as I only needed a baggage drop off. The colour coding of Qatar Airways and the airport is great. The check-in was handled in Bangkok perfectly with rows as well as seats navigated from the left 1 and 2 doors. This resulted in a very speedy and no stress boarding of a fully booked huge airliner. Staff were great with a personal service but without the over-cheesy attitude of another Middle Eastern airline. The food was good and the staff ran every 30-45 minutes with drink rounds. Connection was short and the airport OK. Flight to Cairo was good and the staff had to work double to control passengers that simply ignore every and each announcement from standing while landing etc. The return flight was good but certain points ruined the perfect first impression. Check in was closed but the screens were on and staff at economy check in with a large crowd. The boarding was terrible but I guess I can attest to the less than friendly Cairo terminal 1 holding gates that is barely enough for a small plane but not a 100% booked 777-300. It was a bit of chaos and people standing everywhere. Very claustrophobic. I would suggest Qatar to change its check in counters from the very tight side of T1 as there was no space whatsoever and to request 2 gates since at the moment of waiting to be bussed to the plane it was a less than 1 star experience. Otherwise the flights were on time food great and staff consistent. Definitely will recommend and I believe that the new airport in Qatar is desperately needed. The transfer was very easy and rather pleasant but the terminal was a bit too basic. So 7/10 just for not being able to handle check in and boarding as elegantly as in Bangkok. Qatar should look into it.,Passive
4 Nov Houston-Doha QR714 and 15 Nov Doha-Houston QR713. Business class. Check in at Houston: the desk staff did not know whether coach class seats had power outlets. They do as anyone can find out on the Qatar Airways website. Continuing with the flight attendants. They all seemed to be in-training: could not remember to bring coffee or water even though they were very attentive just not very efficient. On both ways my choice of food was not available. I had to ask 2 or 3 times each way for dessert. The 777LR aircraft in a 2x2x2 business class configuration is not very comfortable being trapped for 16 hours between a window and a sleeping passenger. Doha Airport on both arrivals and departures is undeserving of the beautiful and progressive country of Qatar. Taking my hand luggage down the stairs up the bus off the bus up to immigration is a chore and nobody from the airline offered any help. Overall not a bad airline.,Passive
IAD-DOH Flight 708 on a 777-300 ER. Food was fine the guy at the check in counter changed my seat three times as people checked in to get me an empty bulkhead row so good on him.

PER-DOH-LHR and return. Having never flown with Qatar (normally a Singapore customer) I was tempted by the price and time saved by flying through the Middle East. Can't really fault the experience too much and would recommend them. The PER-DOH flight was a 777 and very comfortable. Lots of leg room and space - felt very relaxed. Entertainment was good too with plenty of films etc. The new Dreamliner flight from DOH-LHR was nearly as good but definitely more cramped. Knees pressing against seat in front. Those IFE boxes have a lot to answer for especially on aisle seats - feet space is minimal. Luckily for me on all 4 flights I had no one sitting next to me so could stretch out. May have been lower score if flight was full. Food and service on all flights was as good as it gets although return trip to Perth was a bit lacking as they were tight with offering up water. Doha airport is in the middle of an upgrade so it was a bit chaotic but ok. Definitely would fly with them again.,Promoter
TRV-DOH-LHR Nov 12 Business. My first Qatar flight taking advantage of the airline joining OneWorld. And in one word - excellent.

A 50-minute transfer in Doha which went very smoothly (would I have made it if I'd had baggage or been in economy?) and a lie-flat seat on a 777 to LHR. Very attentive FAs decent food excellent AVOD on time (actually half-hour early in to LHR thanks to wind).,Promoter

However food options limited and quite low-quality. IFE poor this time with a very small choice of new movies and music albums. Seats were quite comfortable. All-day snack is very repetitive for frequent flyer always the same pizza and almond cake! Transfer at Doha was ok but I hate that old airport. It's a good new to know that they will shift soon to new terminal.,Passive
CPH-DOH-NBO. NBO-DOH-CPH. Been doing this leg every summer since 2011 loved the trip. Chatted with the Cabin Crew. The service was excellent hard working staff in DOH. Nairobi Staff were too serious could smile a little more. Food was ok but I would like some changes as the meals have been the same over the last 2 years. IFE was excellent but the seat space was a little too tight. Excited to Fly with QR again this December and can't wait to Experience the 787 from CPH!,Promoter
ATH-DOH-DXB on 320 and 787 respectively. All flights on time with smooth transfers in DOH. That said new airport must open ASAP as it will make the experience much more pleasant. Staff attentive and friendly but would have liked to see a few more smiles especially during service time. Food and beverages good well presented. Cabin atmosphere nice and relaxing but the seat comfort on the dreamliner not so good. Pre-departure services efficient but I have seen better and far more impressive. IFE needs to be updated and offer more alternatives. Too much Bollywood and Arabic stuff needs more options. DOH-DXB we were not offered headphones because 'it is a very short flight' as we were advised. Their 4-star competition does offer headsets on this route though. All in all a nice experience would definitely recommend but a little overestimated airline.,Passive
MAN-DOH-BKK. Check in at Manchester was fine due to my height 6ft'6 I'd asked for a note to be posted on the system asking for a seat with extra legroom. Priority boarding for Privilege Club members took off a few minutes late flight seemed to be full. The cabin crew soon were coming around with drinks and menus entertainment system ready for use I checked what was on offer and was watching my first choice movie when the meal was served. I had a chicken noodle dish which was one the best meals I'd had in economy class. I rarely sleep on a flight but I may have dozed off for a few minutes before watching a few more movies. Arrived at Doha earlier than expected I had 1 hour 20 minutes transit so had booked the Al Maha Fast track service a very efficient young lady met me at the plane and travelled with me on the transfer bus escorted me direct to the onward check-in for the next flight and straight passed the queue to the departure bus. Bangkok flight was on 777 a vast improvement on the airbus comfort wise similar to previous flight movie and a little doze had a walk down to the galley for a drink and spent some time chatting to the cabin crew. A nice breakfast and arrived in Bangkok on time. Luggage already on the conveyor by the time I'd cleared customs. When I checked in for return flight I used my Qmiles to upgrade to business class from Doha - Manchester so checked in at the business counter and discovered I'd been upgraded to Silver level so I was given access to the priority customers clearance and a pass to the business lounge a nice surprise. Just after boarding the senior cabin attendant came to see me and explained she was aware that my next flight was in business and that prior to landing in Doha she would move me to a seat closer to the business cabin so I could go on the business class but direct to the premium terminal. I spent 8 hours in Doha that the reason for the upgrade to business had a nice dinner followed by breakfast before boarding the flight. Business cabin had only 10 passengers so we were all spoilt by the best cabin crew I've experienced members of the crew introduced themselves and chatted to passengers.,Promoter
BRU-DOH-CCU and back. Flights food and service were more or less ok they took us to the destination with a minor delay. What bothered us was: Half of the plane was very hot and the other half was freezing (same thing happened last year). That each of us including a 2-year old baby were assigned seats in an entirely different location. The entertainment systems often had some minor faults (kept fast forwarding movies if one put their arm on the armrest some buttons did not work at all). Will try a different route next time if possible.,Passive
JNB-DOH-ALG Sept. This is my second time with Qatar. The hand-lotion had disappeared 30 minutes after departure and was not been replaced. The airport is so crowed (might not be the fault of the airline) maybe not for business flyers (hopefully it can join One-World quicker so that when I use the airport next time I can use their lounge). The super cheap ticket is good that it is accessible for many people but the coin definitely has another side!,Passive
We flew recently from London to Kuala Lumpur Malaysia via Doha. The entire trip (to and from) consisted of four 7-hour flights with approximately 2-4 hours stopover at Doha Airport. While we do not have any major complaints Qatar Airways in our opinion do not deserve a 5* airline rating for economy class. The cleanliness of the plane left a lot to be desired. On all four legs of the journey scraps of litter could be seen near the window seats. Food remnants were found on the fold-down table and on the cushion supplied. We were generally satisfied in terms of the level of service food entertainment and the comfort of seat. The touch screen can be a bit hit-and-miss and on one of our flights my partner's TV screen was faulty. Staff were all very polite although it would be interesting to see how they cope if the plane was busier. Previous experience with Emirates were far more satisfactory.,Passive
Travelled during eid holidays from AUH-DOH-KHI and vice versa. The service was good. However the seats were not that comfortable. Apart from this issue everything was good. Would definitely travel again.,Passive
Round-trip JFK-DOH-AMD. Overall excellent experience on all counts. Friendly and courteous staff. Purser came around to make personal introduction and to explain flight amenities. Food was outstanding and the wine choices were top notch (including a 2003 Brunello di Montalcino). All flights were on time or early. The only strange part of the whole experience is the long bus ride from the plane to the terminals - I did it twice as I was transiting through DOH. The Business Class Lounge is probably one of the most grand and well-served that I have experienced. There are multiple stations for tea/coffee snacks full meals and a fully stocked bar. They also provide table service. Flight departures are announced discreetly but effectively.,Promoter
YUL-DOH-DAC. Sep 27 2013. Our flights were on time. We were very well received on board. The service was great. The flight attendants were pleasant and efficient. The Premium Lounge in Doha is very comfortable meeting all our needs and transit time was short. We've been flying this route for 3 years now and have not had any delays. We flew a B777-200 to Doha and A330-200 to Dhaka. Just love the young fleet. The only negative is that the lie flat beds on theA330 which do not completely lie flat are not as comfortable as on the B777. Can't wait to fly Qatar again.,Promoter
QR 31 21/9 QR 19 22/9 QR 20 11/10 and QR 30 12/10. Have just returned to Melbourne from Paris having done the same sectors last year. Another faultless (as far as they can be) flying experience. Good food wine and service. Although a nice terminal at Doha the transfer is a bit lengthy. Wouldn't hesitate to fly with Qatar again. Entertainment selection not huge but OK.,Promoter
LHR-DOH-NBO. Flew the Dreamliner 787 from LHR-DOH fantastic aircraft great in-flight entertainment the steward(ess's) were all friendly and smiling food was really tasty seats were comfortable too. Transfer from aircraft to terminal in Doha was quite lengthy but guess that will improve once they have the new terminal. From DOH-NBO it was an A320 small aircraft but comfortable and again good food and service throughout. The only complaint I have about the flight was that my flight was from 16.00 GMT+1 arriving in NBO 05.35 (GMT+1) and on the LHR-DOH leg they said they don't provide amenity kits because its a day flight (I only wanted the sleeping shades) and then when I got onto the DOH-NBO flight again they don't provide the amenity kits (the flight was from 02.20 - 07.35 GMT+3). Then they serve Dinner on this 2am flight without a doubt the foods great but its 2am and I wanted to sleep. So if your flying on some overnight flight then take your own in economy!,Passive
LHR-DOH and DOH-SIN economy. Great flight in economy from LHR-DOH. Seats comfortable service excellent and inflight entertainment good. Overnight flight and managed to get sleep. Only criticism is they turned lights on a bit early before landing in DOH. Had a quick transfer in DOH for flight to SIN but waited on ground for other connections so flight departed 80 mins late. Plane from DOH to SIN a 777 which was bigger than 330. Again seats good but service very poor with 2 cabin attendants who must have come from BA they were so surly. Inflight entertainment system slower than the flight from LHR. On plus side the 2 flights were the smoothest and quietest I have ever had from UK to SIN. Airline a good 4 star but not 5.,Passive
My wife and I travelled from Manila-Doha-Oslo (Business Class) on 24th/25th Sep 2013. I have nothing but praise for the attendants and aircraft on the outbound journey. First leg was a 777ER this is still a great plane. Second leg was on a 787 Dreamliner this plane makes even the 777 seem obsolete. Inbound journey from Oslo to Doha was again a Dreamliner and was as close to perfect as you could ask for. When we boarded the flight from Doha to Manila on 10th Sep 2013 it was not good from the start. We have flown many times on Qatar Business Class and this was the first time the attendant just pointed up the aisle and said the 2 seats up front on the right. When it came to food I chose the seafood entree and the lobster part was still half frozen there was no tablecloth or serviettes. At least for the main course we were then given tablecloth and serviettes. However we both chose the tenderloin beef this turned out to be dry and overcooked. I was asked which wine would I like I chose a Chardonnay which was excellent but when I asked for another I was given about a tablespoon full and was told they had run out. This flight is always overbooked so it makes sense for the airline to fill the seats. In doing this though the moment these people see free unlimited food and drink they consume it like there is no tomorrow. The plane was an Airbus which is not of the quality of their Boeings due to its age and the seat leg lift did not raise so I ended up with swollen feet as I do in economy. Luckily we spent all our Qmiles on duty free in Doha so now I will try another airline next time. It is a shame as we have never had anything but praise for Qatar.,Passive
Aspires to be a 'five' star airline. We flew UK to Malaysia via Doha two 7hr legs with a 3hr stop over in Doha. Planes were pretty clean seats fairly comfortable but we had a much newer plane on the 2nd outbound leg and this was the best leg of our return trips. Staff were very nice drinks plentiful and varied food pretty good too. Entertainment system worked fine good selection of films/TV to keep you busy. MAS we have flown before are a 5* airline the planes and service just that bit better though you do pay more. Baggage allowance was increased just before we flew to 30kg. They are also fairly relaxed on hand luggage which does mean the overhead storage fills up! The transfer in Doha involved a lengthy bus shuttle to/from the terminal building but perhaps we were unlucky where our planes were parked. I'd use again but would weigh up the saving over a direct flight as there's not much in Doha!,Passive
MEL-DOH-BCN. I think it is important that if you have connecting flight via DOH you need at least a 2 hour transit time between flights because the bussing between the planes and terminal is painstakingly slow. This will of course improve when the new airport is finished. I've come to the conclusion that a long haul economy flight on any airline can become hell on earth after several hours. Crying babies and a too cold cabin only add to the discomfort. The seat in front of me seemed to recline just a little too far and I felt literally boxed in. Qatar do make an effort to make flights a little more comfortable. Great food and staff as well as comfortable seating certainly helped.,Passive
Flew from Heathrow to Kathmandu. Everything was good until Doha however a bit sad from Doha to Kathmandu. It was bit tight but overall experience was excellent.,Promoter
IAH-DOH-CCU-DOH-IAD September 23 2013. IAH-DOH - Incoming aircraft had a lightening strike on its way in and needed a complete check by engineers in Houston. This delayed the flight by over 5 hours and everyone missed connections in DOH. Qatar staff in Doha came through for everyone with alternate flights already worked out by the time we reached DOH. Most people were provided transit visas and accommodation with a generous food allowance in DOH. IFE was good food was okay. Cabin staff was polite and helpful. DOH-CCU - Cabin crew excellent. I had a non functional IFE screen and they tried a restart thrice. After that they switched my seat. The food service was thorough service was attentive and I felt comfortable in a flight with service after a long time. CCU-DOH - Good cabin crew good food and attentive service. Ground staff from Air India could not keep up with the Qatar staff and fumbled the service all through. On the flight smooth sailing. DOH-IAH - Attentive cabin crew and good service all round. The only negative was when they ran out of meal options for the lunch service and had to force the same veg option on everyone. IFE malfunctioned during the flight and they reset the whole system that took 30 mins or so. However IFE service was good. Overall satisfied with the service crew and IFE. It would be better for them to rethink their Indian choice for veg as the food tends to get too dry over a long haul flight.,Passive
SIN-DOH-MAN/BRU-DOH-SIN. Excellent on-board service and the seat pitch is the best I have seen in Economy for a long time. The 777s use 3-3-3 configuration which makes for a comfortable seat. Pouches with toothbrush socks ear plugs and eye-mask were given out on the overnight sectors. Only thing that could get better was on the BRU- DOH sector crew ran out of food trays at the back of the plane and had to ask a few times from the crew in the front. I also had to remind the crew that my travelling companion needed a diabetic meal. But these are small issues. In all value for money better than the other airlines who try to pack close to 400 passengers on their 777s for the same price.,Promoter
"PER-DOH-JFK PER-DOH-CDG MXP-DOH-PER. Great new fleet even the older A320s and A330s are new compared to other major airlines. Newer 777s are gorgeous though have flaws (like stuck TV screens and dirty seats). Food is average. When connecting for hours in Doha you still find yourself with a breakfast omelette followed by another breakfast omelette on the next flight? Entertainment system - good when it works. Great selection but on 6 flights I had 3 seats without working TV and 4 headphones that did not work. Service - pretty poor. Staff are generally indifferent friendly-but-dazed. Timeliness - my experience has not tracked with the on-time stats of the airline. I had one out of six flights depart on time. The rest arrived late by an hour or so. Very decent option for the price but not anywhere as good an experience as its ""5 Star"" competitors such as Singapore or Cathay.",Passive
"BKK-CDG w/a change in Doha and CDG-BKK. This is the 2nd time I have flown w/ Qatar this year and each leg the service is friendly and efficient and the Food is really good. Not to mention their on-time departures. The seats have sufficient space even reclines (well for me at least at 5'7""). They have great selection of food and entertainment and if your lucky enough for an overnight flight a great pouch consisting of socks eye-mask and toothbrush. Anytime you ask for help or are served the flight attendants have a smile. For the money - this is by far my favorite airline.",Promoter
SIN-DOH-BRU and TXL-DOH-SIN. Food onboard was acceptable. Seats were fairly comfortable. Inflight service ranged from average to outstanding depending on the flight attendant. Inflight entertainment was very good. The problem was the transit at Doha it was nothing short of a disaster. The buses that take you to and from the terminal were excruciatingly slow and extremely packed. Even though the bus doors were shut the buses didn't move and we were on the tarmac for about 15 minutes. No announcement no apologies. The terminal itself was packed when we got there and clearly did not have enough toilets. While they were not downright filthy they were certainly not the cleanest toilets in any airport anywhere. After having our boarding pass scanned for the transfer flight we took an escalator down to the waiting area in the bus bay. We waited more than an hour there with about 10 seats no toilets in a room that could comfortably only hold 25 passengers but is now holding a whole plane load. Many started sitting/sleeping on the floor. When it was time to board the bus a stone faced staff member came down to tell us to queue up. Again no announcement no apologies just do as you're told. When the bus got to the plane surprise surprise the doors stayed closed and we stayed inside the packed bus for another 15 minutes. Only on the plane did the captain explain that the aircraft came in late resulting in the delay. I wouldn't want to do another transit in Doha again at least not until their new airport is completed.,Passive
LHR-DXB return via DOH. First leg on A330 - seat and entertainment fine. I hold privilege club gold status and was greeted onboard by crew. Meal choices outlined were inconsistent with what was actually served. Overnight flight which departed one hour late - cabin lights dimmed after dinner service but fully illuminated three hours before landing when they served a snack (which was appalling). Missed connecting flight in Doha but was already booked onto the next flight and had to wait only 90 mins. Second leg on a new A321 with touchscreen entertainment. Crew were polite and efficient. Snack served on this 40minute flight consisted of a savoury and sweet breakfast - which was horrible. A microwaved sandwich and a muffin. Return DXB-DOH again new A321 crew once again polite efficient and friendly. Awful snack once more. DOH-LHR leg was disappointing. The flight was full and on a A330 which was clearly showing its age. Old style IFE - with controller inbuilt into the armrest - which makes it very awkward to operate. Crew were clearly over stretched and somewhat inexperienced forgetting requests and serving wrong meals. I will continue to fly QR but the decline in catering is a concern. Also I have noticed that some crew lack the hospitality which has made QR deserve its 5* status. I remain committed to flying QR whenever possible and will continue to recommend.,Promoter
MCT-DOH-CAI. First leg served with an old and cramped A320. Inflight catering for that leg was not the best just an average snack crew members were doing a good job on that sector. Transit in Doha was a short one around 2 hrs. The terminal itself is so boring if compared to EK's T3 at DXB with a very limited food outlets and coffee shops. The Second leg was served with the companies pride not the 787 but the 777-300ER I would say that the aircraft is pretty much enjoyable in the 3-3-3 abreast layout over Emirates 3-4-3 which gives a feeling of flying a budget airline. Cabin crew on the second leg were just missing the proficiency of a five star airline. Wont hesitate to fly QR again for the sake of the cheap fares.,Passive
We flew to Manchester from HK last month with our baby son. On 3 legs of the trip the service and general experience could not be faulted in particular the cabin crew were genuinely caring for our son providing him with chocolates toys and carrying him around the airplane. On the Doha - Manchester leg of the journey the service was appalling very offhand perhaps not helped by the fact there were extra demands on the attendants due to the fact the in-flight entertainment was not working but our baby son was ignored right down to fact there was no offer of baby food for him! So 3 legs unsurpassed service far superior to my experience on my regular business class airlines but of course what one remembers unfortunately was the one poor experience which was made more memorable by how good the rest of the journey was.,Promoter
SIN-DOH-LHR-DOH-SIN. New plane for SIN-DOH-SIN good service but not comparable with SQ or CX. DOH-LHR-DOH on dated A330 Inflight entertainment system old with technical issues both ways. However will still use QR for its cheap fare.,Passive
London to Dubai via Doha. The service received from the check in desk to all air crew was impeccable. Seats were of good comfort in economy and leg room was good as well. Inflight entertainment had a large number of choices to choose from. A bit of everything for everyone. Was travelling with a 5 Year old and catered their needs well as well as giving well presented child's meal. Only the transfer at Doha needs to improve a bit as having go by coach to the transit and aircraft is annoying. But overall very good and the best service I have had on anyone airline I have travelled that includes BA Virgin and emirates.,Promoter
Been a Qatar frequent flier for a couple of years. Gold card holder and choose Qatar as the preferred airline. Generally extremely Professional and experienced crew. In recent times have noticed that the quality of Food can be much better. I generally choose AVML as the Choice. On the last flight from DOH-OSL I was served a chicken sandwich instead of vegetarian. Been served Pasta as AVML on one of the flights. Food quality is one thing that I believe that QR has dropped in. Customer service is still good (even if an occasional mistake happens). The thing that I did not like on my OSL-DOH flight is that they introduced the 787. I would any day prefer the Comfort of the 777-300ER.,Promoter
Return flight to from London to KL via Doha. 3 of the 4 aircraft's were modern and clean with great in-flight entertainment (all newish A330s) and very good food. Last flight (Doha to London) was awful. Old A330 very smelly not especially clean and rubbish in-flight entertainment. A real disappointment but would not put me off flying Qatar again as generally excellent. Doha airport isn't as bad as everyone says but the busses to and from the terminal do take forever and aren't particularly well air conditioned.,Passive
LHR-DOH-DXB-DOH-LHR. 4 flights on B787/A320/A330. Excellent flights with very smart and professional cabin crew. The meals were tasty and of good quality and nicely presented. 5 star and very happy to travel again.,Promoter

Had high expectations flying with this 5 star airline. We decided on the route MAD-DOH-BKK-DOH-MAD to fly with Qatar for the first time. It was basically all above average but a bit short for a 5 star. No surprises all was efficient smooth and professional. The 777-300 was used on all our four flights. Great entertainment system although the boxes takes up some leg space. Food was correct and service professional but felt quite robotic. Drinks were served frequently during the flights. Planes were all clean and in very good appearance. Doha airport is a problem long bus rides to and from the plane. This will be solved once the new airport opens. We hoped for it to be so before our trip but they still have no date.,Promoter
Perth WA to London LHR on 8 August. I have never felt so well looked after onboard any airline. Despite the length of this journey (22 hours) I thoroughly enjoyed it. Perth - Doha leg was onboard a B777-200LR a very comfortable aircraft. The IFE was brilliant and I was well entertained by (literally) 100s of movies games and television shows. The cabin was ambient with a lovely mood-lighting system. The connection at Doha International was smooth and took me just 1hr and 30 minutes to be onboard my London-bound flight coming from the 777. Doha is a very pleasant airport and a much newer one is on the way. The London leg was onboard B787 and had a very comfortable arrangement (as do all Qatar Aircraft) with Thales IFE. Again wonderful entertainment. The food was wonderful at all parts of the journey and various meals are provided with generous portions. The cabin crew were so professional and smart very friendly. I am very much looking forward to flying Qatar again.,Promoter
MAN-DOH-SIN-DOH-MAN. A330 first leg. Really comfortable seat but preferred 777 on second leg which was perfect lie flat seat and so much roomier. Staff were excellent and couldn't do enough - very polite and attentive. Good Oryx system great headsets and good choice of films. Food excellent and as much drink as you like. The only disappointment was the 'fast track' luggage. Most of economy had left the airport whilst business class were still standing at the conveyor waiting for theirs 40 minutes later!,Promoter
MEL-DOH and DOH-MEL. On flight home mobile phone (on charge) slipped down into seat table mechanism and couldn't be retrieved by hand. Head steward did everything he could to no avail.

Qatar-Seychelles QR703 1 Aug 2013. Doha-Melbourne. QR30. 2 Aug and returned departing 25 August QR31 to Doha and 27 Aug QR702 to Seychelles. While in general we were satisfied with the flights there are a number of issues I would like to raise: 1) We were seated in row 24 on QR30 about halfway down economy. When the meal trolley came we were told instead of the 3 meal options only one was still available. 2) When I asked for a glass of wine I was told it would be brought later. It arrived after my meal was finished. 3) On the return leg my wife who has a bladder problem asked if the trolley could be moved to allow her out. She was told she would have to wait until the attendants had finished and were ready to move on. 4) QR31 25 August was heavily booked. When the lights were brightened after approximately 10 hours there was naturally a rush for the toilets. The number provided on the 777 is in my opinion inadequate. Long queues soon formed.,Passive
MAA-DOH-CDG-JFK (round trip) with our 19 month old infant. CDG-JFK flight was hectic (AA flight) with no legroom. The food was fantastic and the crew were great. Oryx Entertainment system was really good and easy to handle. The whole experience was positive.,Promoter
KHI-DOH-JFK-DOH-KHI August 2013. Staff service still remains excellent. On JFK-DOH sector the cabin crew were the most efficient and helpful crew I have encountered in 20 years. On my last leg of journey the entertainment system was not working. Seat has limited recline. QR needs to improve or may lose the Business class segment of it's loyal customers. Premier lounge at Doha is still excellent but Premier lounge duty free shop has very limited selection of products.,Passive
PER-DOH-LHR on 13 August and LHR-DOH-PER 24 August. 777's all flights. I had a great experience. Staff were very attentive plenty of drinks offered between meals. Food was adequate and on the longer legs there were sandwiches and cakes available in the galley. Seating comfortable the 3-3-3 configuration helps enormously. I was able to stretch out a bit due to some empty seats on the longer legs but even on the packed DOH-LHR flights it was great to have the leg room. The Oryx entertainment system was fine for me. Some new releases and plenty of old favourites. Nice to get an amenity kit on the longer flights also. I would definitely choose to fly with Qatar Airways again but it will be even better once the new airport is built in Doha.,Promoter
"DXB-DOH-BCN 2013 July 19th. A good flight overall but it quality of service went without a doubt down those last months. Always the same mess at DXB Terminal 1 check-in counter Dnata handling group is really a disaster. For this only reason you might prefer to fly Emirates which does not outsource its Terminal 3 to Dnata. Doha airport also was chaotic with very long bus rides and disorganized ground staff. Food service was appalling on DXB-DOH leg (a half burnt-half frozen spinach ""sandwich"") however breakfast and snack served on DOH-BCN flight were both good without being outstanding. Cabin crew were very professional and attentive to the aircraft's cleanliness. QR remains a good choice.",Passive
"LHR-DOH-BKK return in economy. A frequent flyer with Qatar since 2009 I can say that they have really gone ""downhill"" and no longer deserve a 5* rating in economy class. While the aircraft are still modern with new aircraft always arriving the seats spacious (except for 787) and the in-flight entertainment is good the food and drinks have really become poor. They are as bad now as on many US carriers or worse. In contrast in 2009 Qatar had gourmet restaurant quality food. The levels and quality of service from most cabin crews has also declined to being very average. It is very rare for example to see a tray of drinks being carried around now between meals. Overall I would not recommend Qatar Airways any more.",Passive
CAI-DOH-MCT. First sector was served with a very newish A320 which to me offered more comfort than travelling on an A330 or even a 77W the small a/c came equipped with PTVs wide selection of audio and video entertainment all you need and more for this medium haul flight. Food was better than my last EK trip last week but served in very small amounts. Transit in Doha was critically short in time however its nowhere close to EK's T3 at DXB. The next leg was a short hop to Muscat served with a very old and torn out A320 with over head entertainment system. Bottom line I choose QR because they offer the best fare every time I fly this route and its worth every penny.,Passive
SIN-DPS-SIN. New B777 with 3-3-3 in economy vs 3-4-3 with Emirates giving plenty of room width ways and I could quite comfortably stretch out length ways. Nice cabin interior cabin crew responded quickly to the call button. Meal adequate for a two and a half hour flight in Y class. No news papers or magazines but the Oryx inflight entertainment would keep you from getting bored. Baggage allowance of 23kg adequate for a long weekend in Bali but Emirates and Etihad are now giving 30kg. Business class seats looked wide and comfortable compared to Etihad's which are a bit narrow. I look forward to flying on Qatar Airways again they are now on my favourite airline list.,Promoter
SIN-DPS return. SIN-DPS section delayed by an hour no explanation or apology given. Great seats and IFE. No blankets available food was like economy class food on chinaware. No Indonesia immigration cards so a further delay at DPS airport. DPS was a crowded lounge the comfortable section with sofas was for Qatar Airways crew on the flight. DPS- SIN average in terms of service and catering. Not really what I expect from a 5 star airline especially when flying business class.,Detractor
I would certainly fly them again. The Service was good the seats were roomy and the food delicious. I also liked that the flight length from Perth to Doha and then to Manchester was great. It was 10.5 hrs from here to Doha then 6.30 hrs from Dhoa to Manchester. Keep up the good work.,Promoter

Flew first class CAI-DOH on QR503 on 8th Aug 2013. Qatar VIP lounge in CAI is a dump. VIP lounge is roofless and full of flies and A/C is pathetic. Can't really blame Qatar here it's an Egyptian problem. 95% of Qatar staff in CAI were good. Left CAI 20 mins early at 06.00 hrs. Travelled on Airbus A321 and was disappointed to find seats did not fully recline. Stewardesses and stewards were attentive and well-trained. Food and drink on board was top class. Aircraft was clean and fairly new and everything worked. Got to DOH and had 15 hr layover in VIP lounge there which is nothing short of outstanding. Showers TV's free internet recliner beds for snoozing massage chairs manned security lockers family area business facilities. Food and drink availability in VIP lounge is exceptional and all staff were eager to please courteous and well-trained. This airline is punctual and truly a 5 star airline and I will fly with them again anytime.,Promoter
I took a flight to London on 17th July with my 3.5 year old son and wife. Travelling with kids is not easy as they constantly require something to focus their attention to without which they can easily get irritable. We were hoping that the inflight entertainment system would provide ample entertainment to keep my son occupied. Unfortunately the entertainment system suffered technical problems throughout the journey from Doha to London and none of us were able to watch anything. Eventually it turned out to be a boring flight as well as a stressful one. What's more the pilot did not even acknowledge that there was a problem as he should have at least apologized to all the passengers with regards to this shortcoming.,Passive
MAD-DOH-DXB and back. Boeing 777 in MAD-DOH sectors was nice spacious 3-3-3 configuration and good legroom and IFE. Service and food was good but not outstanding as one expects from a 5-star airline. Boeing 787 in DOH-DXB sectors was amazing very modern and quiet airplane although seating would be a little bit tight for a long haul flight. The worst thing about Qatar Airways is Doha Airport it is very uncomfortable. It was crowded bathrooms were dirty and food options very limited. We had a very long bus ride from the terminal to the plane in the DOH- DXB flight. While boarding for the DOH-MAD flight we had to wait for half an hour for the bus to take us to the plane standing for that time in a crowded and small room at 2am is not a 5-star experience. I won't fly with them again until the opening of the new Doha Airport.,Passive
GVA-AUH A320. Good food but after the main meal nothing else was served which I find a bit disappointing. Flight attendants served plenty of drinks throughout the flight. My IFE froze and I asked the FA to try to reset it but she never did. Seat pitch just OK. Overall a good product compared to European carriers.,Passive
London Heathrow - Yangon via Doha return. First three flights were okay - check in staff at LHR a little rude. Economy class seating meal options inflight entertainment all very reasonable but I didn't see the five star airline reputation particularly. Final leg Myanmar to Doha was overbooked and I was kicked off with nosearch for volunteers (seemingly as were a lot of other single male travellers) resulting in a 13 hour layover in Doha. Placed on a 2am flight home and Doha airport was dreadful - food appalling customer service desk rammed and understaffed the staff who were on duty were rude and nobody actually seemed to know where my luggage was. DOH-LHR I have never been treated so rudely by airline staff (told I was in the wrong area when I accidentally went to the wrong toilet). There was a total lack of organisation with this airline.,Detractor
" After 1 month in Thailand and the prospect of coming home to rainy Scotland, I decided to treat myself and upgrade my original economy ticket to business class. Okay I'll get all the positives out the way first. Great lounge at BKK, fully stocked with drinks and all the food I had was very tasty and prepared to a high standard. Seat and all the amenities that come with it were spot on, this is for the A380. The B777 is a more cramped affair altogether, so if you can, fly on the A380 - this applies to economy as well. I loved relaxing at the A380 bar area, watching the football on the big screen, whilst enjoying a freshly made cocktail, bliss! Now the negative, yes, just one, but it's a biggie and that would be the service. Now, don't get me wrong, there were some very pleasant FA's, albeit a bit false but as for the others it's the reason I won't fly Emirates again. After dinner I had a full glass of champagne in front of me, the FA tried to snatch it away, I don't understand this and why would you not ask the customer if they are finished? Needless to say, I snatched it back, much to the FA's annoyance, forgive me for wanting to finish my drink when I'm paying good money. Another point is the staff just hanging around the bar towards the end of the flight, as thought it was their own staff room, I wanted to just chill and spend the last couple hours of my flight reading my book but this just totally put me off. I work in hospitality myself and believe those areas are for the customer and the customer only not for staff to drape themselves over. Upon arrival at the lounge in Dubai, I gave my ticket to receptionist and as I was off a flight and a bit tired I made the heinous mistake of going the wrong way ""Where are you going sir"" was said to me in the tone of ""what are doing you complete and utter buffoon"", not pleasant in the slightest, such a sour character and one you wonder why bother working with the public? So in a nutshell, great food, IFE, seats etc etc. But very, average service, bordering on downright rude at times. For this reason I'll be trying Singapore in future and avoiding Emirates entirely. It's a bad day when a low cost carrier like Easyjet are miles ahead of you in the service department.",Passive
"  We travelled Emirates yet again because we are moving back to England. This one-way flight was a pleasant one. The airport wasn't a pigsty like it usually is when we travel in the summertime. The cabin staff and ground staff are very friendly. When we were at the airport, however, we had to pay AED120 for baggage wrapping only because they didn't have plastic, which isn't very fair, but anyhow. Boarding gate was pretty busy and it was a full flight. It was fairly pleasant on board - no screaming babies for the majority of the duration of flight but just when we took off there was one family with a crying baby. ICE is great but children's selection of films is lousy. Good music on the flight - almost every song i wanted to listen to E-section (Entertainment) had. Seats aren't the most comfortable seats in the world. Food and beverage is great, and almost beats Singapore Airlines' meals. All in all, a good flight - one of our best with Emirates yet.",Promoter
" I booked the tickets with Emirates to Kathmandu from Oslo. Since, they don't operate in Nepal, they use their partner FlyDubai to fly people to Kathmandu.

" I flew out LHR-DXB on economy and was upgraded to business for the return flight. Economy was not too busy so had middle seat free. Check-in was fine and meal quality for economy was pretty good. ICE had a big choice. Flight left a bit late but caught up. 30 minute wait to get my bag at DXB. Return flight - check-in took forever, not enough attendants but getting upgraded to business certainly made up for it. I travelled business on Emirates about 4 years ago and seat configuration has improved and having access to the stand-up bar was great. if I had been paying for business I would have been a bit miffed that my first choice of steak had already gone by the time I was asked. My first course of arabic mezze was served with a choice of breads but no arabic wraps/breads which would have been a far better accompaniment.Main course of seafood biriani was prawns hidden in a flavoured rice, pleasant but nothing remarkable and a bit dry. Pudding of Mango millefeuille was excellent. Choice of wines was fine. Arrival at LGW was on time and luggage came out quickly but given it was North Terminal we had a 15 minute walk to get there.",Promoter
 Dubai to Johannesburg. Absolute horrific customer service. As I approved I informed the lady I'm flying to Johannesburg and the count will close soon. (20 minutes) she said it's fine I need to wait in the queue. of about 19/20 counters there was one person working. There was about 9 passengers in front of me. I waited as told. When I reached the counter finally the lady told me I missed my check in (by 5 minutes) as I was waiting. She refused to help or assist and told me I need to speak to another counter. The manager that he is just said I need to rebook and it's not his problem. As I booked my flight through a third party (my fault) and was checked in already I lost both my flights as I was a no show. This cost me AED 4500 roughly. Emirates has really lost its wow factor with ground staff attitudes. Might as well be all automatic as they will be more pleasant. Most horrible and very expensive experience.

" I and my wife took the flight from Cape Town to Dubai (EK773) and Dubai to Hong Kong (EK382) on 27 Apr to 28 Apr 2019. After we alight the flight (EK773) in Dubai airport at the remote bay, I immediately recalled that I left 3 bottles of liquor on the aircraft during the bus ride to the terminal. It was about 00:30L 28 Apr 2019. Once we arrived at the terminal, we sought help from an Emirates staff, he asked me to go to the information desk. Then we sought the information desk to help, the information desk staff refer me to the transit connection counter. Then we went to connection counter to ask for help. The connection counter staff asked us to wait for one hour there, she said she would see if anyone retrieved anything from the aircraft. Please note that at this point, no staff took note of any of our PAX information. I waited for an hour and went back to the connection counter. The encounter staff dialled Lost & Found and simply passed me the phone to me. The Lost & Found said the aircraft has not been cleared, nothing has retrieved from the aircraft. Since it was about the boarding time for our next flight, I asked my wife to head to the boarding gate and ask the gate staff to help and I waited for 15 mins more. Once my wife arrived at the gate and asked for help. Again, the gate staff simply passed the phone to my wife and asked her to talk to Lost & Found. At this time, the Lost & Found lady told my wife the aircraft has been cleared and nothing has been retrieved. I arrived at the gate 15 mins later. I was so angry because no ground staff were trying to help and none of them seemed care at all. Their service attitude was terrible! The gate staff explained that maybe other PAX took them. I claimed that we were the last PAX to alight the aircraft since we knew we have 3 hrs for transit therefore we didn't need to rush. At this point, we gave up and entered the waiting area at Gate A8. 15 mins later, I decided to ask the gate staff to call the Lost & Found again and let me talk to the Lost & Found directly. This time, the Lost & Found staff told me the aircraft has not been cleared, nothing has been retrieved yet. What is going on? I told her no one recorded any of my PAX information. Then she asked me to send an e-mail to eklost_found@emirates.com as it is the standard procedure for Emirates. I sent the e-mail right away and they acknowledged my query. 24 hours has passed and I still hear nothing! This was my first time flying with Emirates and it was terrible! I understood I was my mistake to leave my liquor on the aircraft. But how can I expect no ground staff actually care to help at all. I had reported the left-over items immediately and I couldn't get them back during the 3 hours transit!",Detractor

" Had 2 great flights from Kuwait to Dubai and back with Emirates. The last time I flown Emirates was back in 2015, I then switched to Qatar Airways which I found is better. My recent flight with Emirates was great overall. But yes, their services went down (seat selection no longer free, 25kg only for Economy Class, no more hot towels served prior to departure in Economy Class. Other negatives are: WiFi was available but not working on both flights. IFE Box under the seats blocking some legroom. Very tiring boarding organization unlike Qatar Airways, Emirates closes the gate 45 minutes prior to departure time, while Qatar Airways closes the gate 20 minutes prior to departure time. Emirates's 45 minutes causes a long long queue. Postives, good and comfortable seats, the 10-abreast B777-300ER is decent, not as bad as people say. Of course I won't deny the Award-Winning Excellent ICE Entertainment System. Despite both flights were operated on old planes with very unresponsive touch screens, the movies selection were up-to-date. Very friendly cabin crew, excellent meal service for a 1 hour 30 minutes flight. Clean cabin, beautiful and luxury Orange-Colored-mood-lighting system. I would fly them again as a second choice after Qatar Airways, it was a pleasure Emirates.",Promoter

We searched the other airlines and could fly with Emirates within 4 hours - best decision we made! When we checked in they noted that we have 3 young children and changed our seats so we could have the front row seats enabling us to sit together and also be able to use their onboard cot for our 9 month old. Once on board the flight attendants were very helpful and friendly. They attached the baby cot to the divider, my 2 older children, 6 & 3, saw the baby pack and wanted the blankets as they came with penguins (didn't say anything, they just poured!) and they were more than happy to supply these for them. The children's food was a good selection of food they actually ate, we were checked on regularly and we found the flight more relaxing than we'd expected travelling with 3 small children! TLDR: A very accommodating airline with friendly and professional staff. Highly recommend, especially if travelling with children!",Promoter

" Manchester to Dubai return. EK18 on 17th April 2019 was great - staff were friendly and helpful, food good, everything nice. Great first impressions of the airline. Flight EK19 back to Manchester on 24th April 2019 not so good. Family to our right let their 3 or 4 year old daughter play in the aisle for approx 5 of the 7 hours flight, she was jumping up and down banging on the floor, swinging on seats, hit my son and staff never said a word at any point even though she was constantly in their way/playing next to other passengers further down the plane, even when they were eating. The father was sat on the aisle seat but made not 1 single attempt to control his daughter, he looked like everything was an effort (except eating the extra meals he asked for, and got) and instead put his headphones on/snoozed whilst his daughter roamed about (in between asking staff for things out of sequence instead of waiting to be served like the rest of us). Was disappointed with the lack of staff response, it ruined our flight. The man had an air of entitlement for some reason, even though his family had 3 seats so, in a way, us families next to him with 4 seats had paid more to be there yet got a worse service (I know it doesn't work like that but it is annoying when 1 passenger thinks they are above everyone else). To make it worse a man had been moved from his rightful seat to accommodate the family in those seats (they had missed their earlier flight so were put on this one instead), which was annoying in hindsight - we would all have had a nice flight in zone D if the original man seated there had not been forced to move. I also paid for extra wifi on both journeys and then it didn't work! Waste of Â£20! My Emirates experience was 10/10 on the way there and then reduced to 4/10 on the way back.",Passive

It felt like a budget flight. On the return flight ground staff had poor customer service. I wanted to buy an extra bag at the airport but they insisted on charging me overweight which amounted to Â£500 and resulting me in leaving my belongings in the UK. Inflight service was poor.

I was initially excited to be flying in an A380 for the first time but the moment I boarded, my heart sunk. It was obvious Emirates had chosen the the cheapest possible configuration that you would expect on a budget domestic airline. The seats were super low quality and grubby. There was next to no padding which made it painful for a 14 hour flight. The air was dry, but worse is the LED lighting which has a low Hz flicker. This becomes migraine inducing as the lighting splits into green blue and red as you move your eyes about. There is also an insufficient number of toilets available.

" Probably the worst flight I ever had with EK since I started flying with them 13 years ago. My route was DXB-CAI and return both ways were with very old outdated B777. First of all EK stopped handing hot towels prior to take off, inflight magazines are removed from the seat pocket probably to reduce cost. On the way DXB-CAI we boarded on time however there was a delay of 1 full hour sitting on board with no explanation. Crew didn't even bother to serve water or a juice and no explanation from the captain, secondly my headphones were not working properly due to the age of the aircraft and I had to keep holding it. Seat was broken and always reclining however I informed the crew but nothing happened, they kept asking me to adjust my seat to up position and I kept telling them it was broken. On the way back it was the opposite, it wouldn't recline at all. The food service also has dropped a lot with the quality of the meal service and the portions which have become similar to what you get on a Low cost. When arrived back to Dubai also 30 mins late the luggage was delayed for more than an hour, they announced on the speakers but no explanation which led to being late for my early morning meeting as was supposed to land at 7:10am and had meeting at 9:30 am but I had to cancel it and of course no explanation or visibility of EK staff.

We always reserve (at extra cost) dual seats of row 48 but were re-allocated to seats row 37 which on the seat map look identical. However, on boarding we found that 3 extra rows had added and row 37 was a normal triple seat. The purser apologised and moved us to the only double row available in row 39 - the one with fixed arm rests and of-set screens. My request for a refund of the seat reservation charge of â‚¬80 was refused on the grounds that Emirates are allowed to make changes for 'operational reasons'. Because of the extra rows seat pitch is now 31"" and not the 33"" - 34"" shown on the seat map. Food quality has also dropped but I overcame this by ordering a Kosher meal for this return flight which was delicious after waiting 20 minutes for it to thaw out!

" London Gatwick to Islamabad via Dubai. My first time on Emirates. I had heard good things about this airline in the past so decided to give it a go. Baggage drop-off at Gatwick was fine. The gate at Gatwick was horrible, a small space to accommodate all economy class passenger of an A380. Most of us had to stand for a long time before boarding commenced as the seating at the gate were totally inadequate. My seat on the A380 was comfortable but the IFE did not work. The seat would not recline either. The stewardess tried to help but ended up apologizing for the broken IFE and seat. The meal service was good and the quality of food reasonable, however, the portion sizes were very small. The flight from Dubai to Islamabad was not good at all. Boarding at Dubai was chaotic, Most passengers were not allowed to take their hand luggage on board with them as according the staff at the gate the flight was full and there would not be enough space on the plane for hand luggage despite the fact that most people had just one item of hand luggage with them. The boarding process took a long time and the gate staff didn't seem too bothered. The seats on Boeing 777-300ER were extremely uncomfortable, the legroom was very tight and the seat width was also very cramped. Shortly after boarding completed, the cabin lights were switched off with on the screens and seat belt signs providing any light. The captain announced that we would be delayed due to heavy traffic along our flight path. No cabin crew were around to answer any queries and any calls for them were ignored. We eventually left Dubai over an hour late. The rest of the flight was unremarkable. The crew were not very friendly and didn't seem too bothered.

"  Oslo to Singapore via Dubai. I expected something more from an airline like Emirates. My friends who have flown with them, told me that has very good food in economy class, and the cabin crew are friendly. This is the opposite of what I have experienced. My first flight was from Oslo to Dubai on the 21st of March. We flew with a Boeing 777, reg A6-EWC. Before the flight, I was happy that I could use the ICE, an internationally awarded In-flight entertainment system. I was really disappointed when I touched the screen, because it was unusable. The screen heated up to 40-50 degrees, and the touch didn't work well. The food was OK, but again, I expected something more from an airline like Emirates. Two members of the cabin crew were rude to me. The flight from Dubai to Singapore with A388 was really good. Plenty of legroom under the seat in front of me. Back to Oslo, I have ordered Vegetarian meal to try something different (I had Asian vegetarian meal from OSL to SIN). I was angry when they gave me vegan food. Is it so hard to see the difference between Vegetarian and vegan food?. It was definitely the worst meal I have eaten on an airplane.

" I expected something more from Emirates. I've heard many pros about the airline from my friends who have flown with Emirates and an ex-Emirates stewardess. What I experienced, is the opposite of what they told me. They told me that the food is the best food you can eat in economy class. I have also read that the ICE intertainment system is the best IFE system in the world. I do not agree at all. My first flight was from Oslo to Dubai, flight number EK 160. We flew with a Boeing 777, reg A6-EWC. I was excited to try the ICE, so the first thing I did after I found my seat was to try the system. I was very disappointed when I realized, that the screen's temperature is over 40 degrees, and the touch works badly. The sound from the headphones was also very noisy, I think that DACs in the aircraft were maybe broken. I ordered Asian Vegetarian meal (AVML) on their website before the flight. Agian, I expected something more from a 4 star airline like Emirates. The food was just OK, nothing more than that. The next flight was from Dubai to Singapore with an A380, reg A6-EOT. The A380 was the best long haul plane I have flown with. There was a lot of legroom, and place next to the seat (I had a window seat) to leave small things like a pillow or your headsets. This time, the ICE worked well, and was more advanced than the old crap in the 777. Unfortunately, the cabin crew were rude and they didn't care about the passengers as much as the cabin crew in KLM or even AirAsia. I saw them only when twice when they gave food to the pax. On the way back to Oslo, I ordered Vegetarian meal. I was shocked, when they came with a Vegan meal. Is it so hard to see the difference? All other airlines offer vegeterian food or even lacto-ovo vegetarian etc. Also, I don't recommend the meal for those who are Vegans. It was really disgusting, and it was too warm. I will never recommend this airline to anybody. I could fly cheaper with airlines like Qatar Airways, LOT or Finnair, but I bought an Emirates ticket just for the A80.",Detractor
" Beirut to Colombo via Dubai. The flights were comfortable both ways and Emirates staff on board were helpful and friendly but on our way back from Colombo to Dubai we had a short layover and our first flight was delayed and then parked miles from the terminal, necessitating a long bus ride and meaning that we rushed to make our connection.

Our flights was then delayed by the gate for 30 minutes, leaving plenty of time for the bags to be loaded. Despite this, when we arrived in Beirut, we received a message to say our luggage wasn't on the plane and would arrive on the next flight, eight hours later. We were told by ground staff that it could not be delivered and we would have to return to the airport to collect it. It took us almost an hour to find the Emirates office and someone who would help us. He promised that if we returned that evening to collect the bags the office would be open and Emirates staff would help us and would reimburse our taxi costs. When we got back, the office was closed and locked and no one answered the phone. We tried going back three times over the course of an hour. No one was there. Eventually we got our bags but the process meant we lost almost four hours of our day and over $30 in additional taxi costs. Finally, as we were leaving the airport, Emirates staff called us to say that they were at baggage claim, though we had already been there to get our bags and seen no sign of them. When we explained that we had already left the airport, they told us to come back, despite the fact that we had already lost all the money on the extra taxis, not to mention our one free day back at home to prepare before going back to work.

I got the middle seat and felt very claustrophobic. If you are also going as a couple or with a friend, it's hard to carry a conversation with the person you are flying next to since the divider in between doesn't even go down completely. On a long plane ride, this is very frustrating that you cannot even carry a proper conversation or see the person next to you. In terms of the service, the stewardess serving me was lazy and made me hand her all the trays and hand myself all the plates rather than setting it down directly on the table. I thought this is very unsafe since some dishes are very hot. She was also too lazy to make the bed for me so I had to do it myself. Not only that but one of the stewardesses left the tray on the seat in front of us which crashing down in front of my boyfriends feet during the middle of the flight. The head flight attendant walking by noticed it and didn't even apologize and rather asked us abruptly what had happened like it was our fault his staff left the tray there. There are also no slippers or pajamas offered like other flights. The food is also not personalized and not very good. They didn't even offer us dessert and when we asked for it, they assumed someone had already taken our order and didn't give us the dessert. Most of all, the airport lounge in Dubai on the way to another city is really outdated, basic and unimpressive. It's really long and big but composed of the same basic food drinks and no amenities other than a few shower rooms. The spa which was on the map was closed and half the loung was also closed when we were there for no reasons given. All the other major airlines business class I had taken including cathay, Singapore airlines, korean air and Etihad had much better lounges. I especially expected more since Emirates is Dubai's flagship carrier but it looks like they cut costs severely. Would not take Emirates again although I already bought several more tickets for the rest of the leg of this trip that I cannot cancel. Some positives were chauffeur service, private entrance at gate for customs and security check in the Dubai airport, and the entertainment system on the plane which had a lot of movies. However the WiFi was very slow, overall very disappointed.",Detractor
" The ground staff, flight, in flight entertainment, meal and seat is awesome. Flight Attendants welcomed us and helped to get us to our seats. I was given a noise cancelling headphones and a clean blanket. Food was just amazing. I got some time to have a word with Flight crews and they happily enjoyed to talk with me. The washroom was clean and nicely maintained.",Promoter
" I and my husband are 71 years old, flying regularly twice a year for many years and this flight was our worst flying experience ever! This flight was 6 hours long and we purchased the tickets with Emirates based on their advertising and did not mind paying almost double price than all the other companies charge. We wanted on this pretty long flight more comfort, wider seats, more legroom, good food and overall better experience as Emirates advertise. The outbound flight was with Emirates partner company FLy Dubai, Boeing 737Max not Airbus 380 as they advertise. Nothing of the advertisement was true. The airplane had regular narrow seats and little legroom and there was no complimentary drinks and food at all. This is almost criminal! Yes, you could buy drinks and food but why you pay almost double price to fly with this company? Their advertisement is fraudulent. On this journey we also flew from Abu Dhabi to Muscat with Oman Air. The flight was only 60 min. long and complimentary drinks and luncheon was served. Than we flew from Muscat back to Dubai with Swiss Air. On this only 50 min. long flight complimentary water and snack was served. The inbound flight with Emirates was not bad, Airbus 380, little wider seats and little more legroom, complimentary drinks and food. Nothing really great but OK. I complained to Emirates about our outbound flight without any successful result. They wrote me that their partner company should have same standards and that they are looking forward to see me on board again. I felt offended! I would never fly with Emirates again.",Detractor
" Business class feels like a train, large cabin no individual attention. Twice during the flight 5 cabin crew were sitting in the galley in groups chatting and drinking. Oblivious to the passengers, I have never seen this in all my years of flying. In front of the loos and the bar area. Really poor show. The cabin crew seemed to be more interested in socialising with each other with a few noticeable exceptions, the Filipinos. Meal service efficient as opposed to caring, was told the WiFi wasn't working but could see passengers using it, think the crew member couldn't be bothered to help. Positives - excellent limousine pick up, lounges and connections. Entertainment first class. Don't get complacent or arrogant Emirates as customers aren't stupid.",Passive
" Colombo to London via Dubai. On each of the 4 legs of my journey I would have received better service by Easyjet. At least there the incentive is for the cabin crew to provide drinks and food as they earn income. My last flight from Dubai to London Heathrow, it was 3 hours and 10 minutes before I was offered a drink! The food was lukewarm on both legs, and had to be swapped over. Emirates seems to have cut costs terribly in recent years, it's economy service is miles behind even budget carriers now. It does not deserve its 4 stars, I would not choose to travel with them in the future. Inflight entertainment was good, but the cabin and seat were tired.",Detractor
" Kuala Lumpur to London via Dubai. Flight entertainment out of this world and the food was amazing. I love the look in the aircraft as well. Cabin service was good but ground service was terrible especially in Gatwick Airport. Staff were unfriendly and not helpful at all. Another thing is that the inconvenient online booking system of Emirates. we are a family of 4, 1 of us must be booked separately because of extra baggage weight which lead to we cannot check in together. Furthermore, we successfully checked in online for the first 3 of us but another family member with the separated booking cannot check in online due to overbooked flight. Therefore, we went to the counter to check in and they gave us 4 new seats, including the other 3 of us who checked in online earlier with already selected seats. Also we got new seats without being informed. Also almost all the seats are taken during 47 hours before departure for our return flights, I wonder why. In overall, I would still recommend flying with Emirates because of the inflight entertainment system, and in flight comfortably not to mention the A380.",Promoter
" London to Dubai. From 1st March 19, Emirates have decided that when purchasing a business or indeed first class ticket using reward miles, that traveler will be treated very differently to a ""paid"" ticket holder, in that they will not be provided with chauffeur drive. Quite appalling that Emirates feel the need to save money by penalizing its most loyal customers! To add to the insult, Emirates will not even honor the service on tickets purchased before the rule change.",Detractor
" We have flown Emirates many times from Washington to Bangkok via Dubai. No problems. Everything very nice. This last flight (February 2019) we left 90 minutes late from Bangkok (technical problems) and missed our connection. We were assured agents would be there to discuss options at Dubai. We were met at the airport and handed (no discussion) a ticket for the next flight (next day 24 hours away) and a hotel voucher. No Emirates agents were at the hotel nor were there any agents at the airport that could answer any question about upgrading or compensation. No one knew anything about anything. Unbelievable. Will never fly Emirates again. There is no customer service for this airline. If you call the 1800 number, they tell you to go online. You go online and it will take a month to hear back. A US carrier could not stay in business with this kind of policy. If you were flying to the Euro zone there are policies for compensating people. Nothing if you fly from the US even on business class. If you are concerned about potential problems with this airline do realize you will never find an agent to help you with a problem.",Detractor
" My wife was travelling from Birmingham to Delhi return via Dubai. While she was on her way back to the UK she experienced the worst service from Dubai airport ground staff. My wife was carrying our daughter (1 year) on her lap and strolling a cabin back with one hand, a backpack on her back and holding a personal bag in her second hand. She was coming from India and it was late night flight from India. She saw a cart at the airport with 2-3 ground staff members sitting in it. She asked them to help her but they said no. How could you do that to a mother of a toddler? The 2nd incident happened to me when I was flying along-with my wife and daughter. The flight was late so they ended up rushing all the passengers to the plane in no time. Then to my surprise although I was standing and carrying my daughter on the lap",Detractor
" Dubai to London. After being a loyal Emirates customer for over a decade, its very concerning to see the airline taking steps which are substandard to the expectations of its customers. The concerns are longline of areas from the cabin crew to the food and overall standards. The cabin crew were extremely attentive and customer orientated to the needs of the passengers rather now it seems a case of a attention deficit order in play. The food that is now served was on this particular case of poor quality and not foregoing that the option was let just say not an option (chicken only or nothing). The sweet dish again, was disappointing and finally the clotted cream, resembled more to a true likeness of garlic sauce in a small tub than what was previous served. These little cutbacks and poor service is going to have a massive impact in the way customers feel towards Emirates.",Detractor
" Riyadh to Newcastle via Dubai. Generally good service, until lunch. Was served an Economy meal on a Business Class plate. I could check the Economy menu, so I knew what it was, and it was pretty inedible. Staff on board were initially adamant that I was having a Business Class meal, but later relented. Emirates seemed unwilling to acknowledge the issue, offered me 10000 points (hardly worth it) and noted it was possible to 'source a meal from a different section of the aircraft', without an apology for the mistake. So watch out - Emirates seem to think this practice is acceptable.",Detractor
" Dubai to DÃ¼sseldorf. Again a great flight with Emirates. We had a great experience on that flight. The service was great, after departure we got snacks and drinks.

"  London to Dubai. After my daughter and I being upgraded to business as a surprise we entered the cabin very excited. The staff were amazing, my husband and I had been allocated seats apart and although not a major problem for us our stewardess went out of her way to re-seat us once everyone had boarded. Food was superb as was choice of drinks. The seats are individual pods and mattresses offered out as a night flight. We were too excited to sleep but the staff were so friendly and we enjoyed spending time in the bar area and talking to the crew. Obviously travelling business class is going to be an amazing experience but the staff just made it complete. I would just like to say I took the same route in December and was perfectly happy with the whole flight. Leg room good as was food and although the drinks trolley runs are no longer very regular the staff are more than happy to get you something if you ask. Well done Emirates we will definitely be using you again.",Promoter
" I was advised by one of the agents that you can refund a flight booked on FLEX rate but when we tried to request for it they refuse and citing that I shouldn't believe everything the agents say and since I was the one who made the booking it was my fault. Instead they want us to reschedule it and spend $600+ for the fee. I feel there is miscalculations on both sides but they should have been considerate. The worst is when you call their customer support hotline, initially my call was routed to India, when I did follow up on the next day Dubai based support is refusing to take ownership of the case and they blame their counterparts in India. As a Skyward member I will no longer flying with this airline.",Detractor

" Sydney to Kathmandu via Dubai. Never fly in their partnership flights We love Emirates. We fly with them even if it is few hundred dollars expensive or a couple of hours longer journey. Appreciate lovely crews, wifi, comfortable seats and food. However, I found that their connection and transit service is worst (cannot compare with any other airport standard) at Dubai and they don't respect passengers flying with them in partnership arrangements. Emirates took off 25 min late from SYD. It took additional 20 min to reach to gate at Dubai. Almost 45 min late. Hardly 1 Hr and a bit left for my next flight to KTM. As there was no one waiting at the plane gate, I rushed to Emirates connection centre at Dubai. The response I got there was very upsetting. They were not helping me because my other flight was with flyDubai (which I did not notice earlier as I booked this thru Emirates). Gate number of my flight was not displayed in the Boards. No one helped me, they asked me to wait the gate number to be displayed, which never did. I missed the flight, because the Emirates was late and their information system was not good. They did not bother to help us because we were only 3 passengers in this connection. The following flyDubai flight to KTM was over-booked, so we had to wait next Oman Air flight via Mascot. I reached KTM approx. 18 hrs late to find another surprise. My little suitcase was broken. I made a complain at Sydney and claimed for missing goods. Emirates responded to me in 7 days as - â€œit is the airline industry policy and agreement between airlines. Oman Air has a direct responsibility to resolve your claim.. suggest that you contact Oman Air.â€ I was expecting something better than this from Emirates Airlines. My advice, never fly in their partnership flights, avoid Dubai airport connection if possible.",Detractor

From check in at the airport in DC (IAD) the staff were rude, insisted that our luggage be exactly 20lbs (where is the limit is 23lb/bag). The staff in Kabul insisted that I could not take a carry on with me because it was a kilo over the limit whereas I saw others carrying much larger bags than my little carry on bag.

" Manila to Cape Town via Dubai. Emirates has been incredibly disappointing on so many fronts. The Special meal I ordered didn't show up. As opposed to being super apologetic the airline crew was just rather indifferent. Also the regular meals provided in business class were terrible. Business class felt like economy class service. Staff came out when there was meal service and otherwise just huddled in the cabin and chatted outside of that. Really got the distinct impression that I was bothering them every time I had to go to the cabin to get water. They used to be better. Not sure what happened to this airline. Airport Transfer: security check points to transfer from one gate to another along with an arduous bus ride. Amenities: Nice Kit but no slippers in the plane. Seats: This was the worst part. The seats are not truly flat bed and just not comfy. It really felt like I was in a 1 star airline. No free Internet in business class and after paying $15 I got very bad quality internet. No power in the seat. While there was a socket, it was not working.The lounge at Dubai airport is really good",Detractor
" Budapest to Dubai. A regular traveler to Emirates, I was very disappointed, once again, by this company's sharply lower performance. The welcome on the plane is expeditious, the smiles rare. We had two hostesses, one obviously beginner, shy to the point of not being able to look in the eyes while talking to us, and faster than lightning: the tablecloths are literally thrown on the shelves, the drinks served without presentation, she ran most of the time like most hostesses. The dishes had little flavor. Only positive points: the quality of the wines, including Champagne and the plate of cheese. The device ""wifi"" control of audiovisual instruments did not work, despite the repair efforts of a hostess much more experienced, pleasant and smiling, that we saw that during the claim. The limousine service promised in the price of the ticket is non-existent in Phuket, for reasons never explained, and the car provided to Dubai was the worst, dented on its flank must, while we have well reminded the hostess of the counter. we were theoretically entitled to two cars, having two separate tickets.

When I arrived to DXB, I requested my luggage to be off the airplane and was told to wait for 2 hours to be able to collect my luggage.

" Vienna to Cape Town via Dubai. This review is about my outbound flight to Cape Town (December 19th 2018). My children and I were denied boarding our flight to South Africa due to not having their birth certificates upon check-in, even though the South African government updated the policy December 1st 2018 (which no longer requires this document as mandatory). Not only did Emirate not indicate at any time during the booking process about this law they refused to reason when I showed them South African's government recent update. Due to the busy Christmas season, we were unable to fly to South African until 3 days later, missed the cruise we were to join and had to embark the ship in Namibia 6 days after the original travel date. We were meant to meet my husband on board the ship and missed out on Christmas because of this mistake. The kids were devastated. We were over EURâ‚¬4,500 out of pocket since I had to book hotels, new flights and transfers, all because they hadn't updated their policies. Their customer service department is a joke as the only way I could submit a complaint was through their website online form.

" London Heathrow to Dubai. Was very excited to be flying Emirates business class after a wonderful set of flights to Australia last year. However the service has gone downhill and fast. Firstly the chauffeur pick up was terrible - a surly and moody driver who arrived late wasn't a great start. The lounge at T3 heathrow was fine but then we arrived to find a plane which whilst cannot be that old given its an A380, was seemingly falling apart. People's seats didn't work properly, my TV was broken, and the bar area looked terrible.

" Dubai to Bahrain. So we all know that economy gets you from A to B, safely and we are not expecting much especially with a short hop like this, only a one hour flight. Paid for a extra room seat at Door 3, 24 D being an aisle on the B777. Flight was very full with many children and to their credit two of the crew were very engaging with them and their parents. What I do not get is why Emirates insist on placing ten across high density on all their B777 aircraft - an industry norm these days but it begs belief. As the crew went up and down the aisle I was knocked into over 12 times in less than an hour and I am 78 Kg, some at least had the courtesy to apologize, most did not bother. I get its cattle class but I for one would never set foot on these aircraft in this high density. I find EK crew to be stoic, tired looking, the crew member at my door crew seat looked as if he dying for his bed, head in his hands, yawned non stop and a lot of the crew looked plain disinterested. This is obviously down to crew planning being over stretched. Overall ok, flight deck did a great job with announcements and the flight itself and landing was excellent - true skill. Would not fly long haul based on this, you see a totally different service and staff attitude between J and Y class. Engaged to must I do the basics.",Detractor
" I travelled from Manchester to Faisalabad vi. Dubai, and from Manchester to Dubai the service was good. But from Dubai to Faisalabad, Emirates use the service provided by Flydubai, whose service is of a very poor quality. When providing a 'meal' it was just a small snack and when I asked about a hot drink such as a cup of tea, I was told to pay 20 dirhams (roughly Â£4.21 each), and soft drinks were roughly 5 dirhams (Â£1.05). I had 3 family members travelling with me (including my elderly parents), we paid over Â£2000 for tickets alone, and on top of that we were asked for outrageous prices for a service which should be covered by the ticket prices anyway. I contacted Emirates to complain and the email I received in reply was written in a way as though I were at fault, stating things such as ""this is the service we will contnue to provide"" and that I should contact my agent as they should have told me about these extra charges. However, on their booking it says 'meal provided' on both Emirates service and flydubai's service which would suggest that a reasonable meal is given, when in fact it was simply a small snack. A few days later a friend of mine returned from Faisalabad and Emirates were using the same service and the flight was delayed causing the airline to provide a hotel room. The shocking thing was he was told he would have to share a hotel room with complete strangers. No company has a right to do this as it is an invasion of privacy and is extremely invasive. It is clear that Emirates no longer have the same standard of service and I would not use this service again myself, nor recommend it to anyone else in the future.",Detractor

Other than a drink with the meal there were no further offers for cups of tea or even water for the rest of the flight.

After the reboot the remotes would not work, either of them so just gave up and watched a movie. Service started very quickly, well if you wait until they go to the rear of BC and then the front, doing us in the middle last, is this the norm? Service was rushed, offered one drink before dinner then service slapdash. They just seemed to want service done and dusted then that was it, go to sleep. Male member in the galley after dinner couldn't have made anymore noise if he had a hammer smashing plates. If this is Business Class then you can keep it.

" Dubai to Kuwait in economy class. At the check-in counter, we asked the lady if she could put a priority bag on our luggage which she did. However, when I reached Kuwait, my luggage came much later than it should have. I did not expect Emirates airlines to have such a bad service",Detractor
" Male to Colombo. The customer service for such a high profile airline is beyond unacceptable.

" Dubai to Delhi . The journey started from our hotel to the airport. Emirates provides complimentary chauffeur drive in Dubai. The chauffeur service, priority check-in and the lounge were exceptional. The ground service helped us navigate our way in the airport. Boarding was smooth, the plane was old however, with clean interiors. The inflight service was not up to the mark. The crew wasn't courteous and did not meet the expectations of business class. The big let down was that the crew did not offer or serve any desserts and even refused to provide a second round of drinks.",Passive
" Hyderabad to Seattle via Dubai. Even though I had booked the ticket for my spouse and 11 month old kid with bassinet, Emirates did not honor the ticket and rejected my spouse request for providing the bassinet and forced her to sit with my son on her lap.

She never want to fly Emirates again.",Detractor
" Munich to Riyadh via Dubai. Both aircraft were in excellent condition, both from a maintenance and cleanliness point of view. The crew is friendly and offers a punctual and reliable service. The seats are exceptionally comfortable and guarantee very high privacy: there is plenty of space for the legs and for hand luggage and the division between the seats allows extra comfort. The Wi-Fi is free for every Skywards member. Since the registration to the program is also free, the service is very good. It is not the fastest one, but definitely with the best value for money. There is plenty of choice regarding entertainment. The ground service is exceptional: I forgot one bag on the plane and during the layover between the other connection the staff was able to retrieve my baggage and bring it to the lounge in time for the next flight. Best service ever!",Promoter
" Amsterdam to Cape Town via Dubai. As a very frequent emirates passenger in the past, we have nor used the economy Emirates product for over 4 years. Check in was laborious as a they were checking everyone's visas which is understandable. Boarding was good. No issues both in AMS or DXB. Onboard service is now a huge let down. On both sectors after take off it took 2 hours before the food service was started. And at no point was a bar service offered. Not just alcohol beverages but water or soft drinks. The food was below average and it was only after the food was eaten the bar service came out. I can on Y assume that Emirates is trying to cut back and save money. But what they don't realise is the majority of there traffic is in Economy and if you keep cutting the service then people will stop booking. Especially when the completion like Qatar or Etihad offer better service on the same routes. We will not be booking with Emirates economy in the near future as it is not a pleasurable experience anymore. Also I felt the ICE was of a reduced choice as compared to a few years ago. Sorry Emirates but you are living on previous accolades.",Detractor
 Madrid to Sydney via Dubai. This is a review that is a follow up on my outbound. The reviews are almost identical. Great hard product but the soft product on Emirates is just simply lacking and its down to the crews who are at best very lackadaisical. You have a few who are superb but on the whole it reflects a training problem. Much noise and chat going on which is very annoying during the night routes. One thing I have never seen and clearly much revelry goes on in the Emirates dorms. One female FA groped the boob of another in a playful manner. Now for red hot blooded males this may be fine but sorry this is a major flag carrier. Whilst on the Emirates gripe. The IFE is fine but to be honest was struggling too find some films that really appealed. Emirates caters for a huge language base. Final gripe. The seat quality certainly in economy is dire. The cushioning is hard or maybe has been so well used that it is worn. Come on Emirates. A one time leader has slipped into the pack with a terrible soft product.,Passive
" Sydney to Madrid via Dubai. Being a Qantas FF I occasionally travel on Emirates but with a Qantas code on it. Now same aircraft (A380) but the whole experience is totally different. Have been on Emirates a few times a year mostly when routing to a Europe port other than London. Sydney being the Qantas home base is these days very efficient to get through. Self check in (even though i can use the First counter) and through security and to the Qantas lounge in probably 15 minutes. The Emirates version is very different and rightly so as it is not home base. The economy line up was massive. Fortunately could use the premium line and was through swiftly. Time for Emirates to start using self check in. Used the superb Qantas First Lounge and then moved over to the Emirates lounge which was a very pleasant place. From there the whole experience was pretty dismal. Had a whole row to myself in the main cabin which was great. Same sights and sounds as for the Qantas A380 but its the customer service that lets Emirates down. They just simply have recruited too many young kids who just dont have the professionalism or charm of the slightly older crews on Qantas main line. Its really a training problem. Having crew that speak 30 languages on board is fine but does not help if their manner is to put it mildly rather brusque. Charm school is sorely missing. Mid flight snacks are poor to non existent. Food is a little underwhelming. Delayed start from Sydney due to bad weather and a tight connection meant a run through Dubai T3 to get to the Madrid flight. Same plane, different crew but same lack of charm and professionalism. And Emirates...one other thing. Please do not have your crews take away blankets, act as general cleaners and so on around 30 minutes before landing. It jut is not a great look. Overall the airline needs to employ proper training methods or better still get some older crew who can teach the young ones how to. The fact is that Emirates gets away with sloppy standards since they have a great network, hard product in the A380, great airport in Dubai. For me it is the easiest way to get to Madrid from Sydney so have to get used to a substandard level of service which many people have commented on. I would recommend Emirates only as it has the route network and schedules. Bit short on other alternatives at that price point.",Passive
" Brussels to Dubai. The worst customer service I have experienced. After booking a round trip flight, I had to change the time of the outbound flight for latter on, the same day, due to work commitments. Their customer services explained to me that I will only need to book a one way flight from Europe to Dubai as my return flight, which was already booked, will remain valid. However, one day before the date of my return flight back to Europe, I found out that my ticket had been cancelled due to â€œno showâ€, despite being told previously that I will be able to use my return flight. In addition to that, the complaint has been handled extremely poorly, with a complete lack of consideration, by Emirates customer services who repeatedly refused to transfer me to a manager for an official complaint.",Detractor
" I have been flying Emirates since 2008 and the quality of service has gone done tremendously. My trip from Kuwait to Houston via Dubai is a long flight. I asked for help due to my seat being broken and no help. The staff on this flight were very rude. Usually if a passenger is standing in the back area and looking at the flight attendant, they will ask may I help you, not this crew. The conversation continued until they were finished were their conversation. It was like that I was bothering them or something. I sent email to custom services and it was like it was my fault.",Detractor
" Nairobi to Houston via Dubai. I flew economy for the first time in a while after previously flying business and was so disappointed with the level of customer service. I felt almost inferior. I guess you get what you pay for. From lack of healthy snacks between meals, to not being able to get a bottle of water (because they are for service - even though I ended up drinking the same amount of water every time I got up to look for some). I was so disappointed and am currently dreading my return trip. I might change airlines after this. I would hope that how I get treated in business should translate across the board.",Detractor
" Bangkok to Manchester via Dubai. In last years Emirates was my favorite carrier. But now I think their customer service quality has fallen down from top to bottom. Today I finished my trip and all 4 flights I noticed same problems: bad customer service in economy class. Flight attendants not present during almost whole flight. 6-8 hours flight only 2 times passengers got something to drink. Yesterday BKK-DXB onboard very rude flight staff. DXB-MAN attendants were lazy and not very nice. Talking a lot, flirting with themselves and definitely not interested about passengers. Complimentary limited WiFi never connecting. Food is poor, portions are small and tasteless. Return flight to my city someone took from carousel my backpack. Guy from Emirates airport staff whom I asked about help called that passenger who swapped backpacks. Then he told me to wait for that passenger, he will come soon and we can swap the backpacks again. He left me with not my backpack at public area and told me: keep eye on this. I lost two hours waiting and finally airport security guys came to me and asked many questions about what I am doing here. I told them what happened. They did not believe me and checked everything around me with detector and told me this situation is definitely against airport safety rules. Big shame for Emirates. I will not use anymore Emirates because at the moment customer service is unacceptable.",Detractor

She was clearly being rude by rolling her eyes, I don't think there was any good reasons for a staff to be rude, or getting annoyed when there were absolutely no other customers to serve and they were clearly not busy.",Detractor
 Cairo to Sydney via Dubai. Emirates dumped us with my children in the gate hall for 9 hours due to issues with plane and after 5 hours of conversations with their staff they started serving water and cheese sandwiches. On my next flight they have re-selected the seating where I cannot set beside my 8 years son for a 14 hours flight - after a long discussion they offered me a seat with my son in the front and my wife with my other son but in the back.

" Bangkok to Sydney. Booked and paid for full fare business class seat on EK418. Checked in on line and printed a boarding pass. On arrival at Bangkok airport was told that they were overbooked and I would be downgraded to economy. After some time was offered a return business class ticket, Sydney to Bangkok return to be used by October 2019. Not happy but accepted the deal as I needed to be in Sydney. Now, at the end of January I called to redeem my voucher for a flight on August 19th, returning to Sydney 15th. As Emirates have changed their schedule they now refuse to honour the voucher. They have available seats on Qantas code share from Sydney but flatly refuse to accept their own voucher. Emirates did infer that they may be able to offer a Jetstar code share out of Melbourne. This is completely unacceptable. I note that Emirates are cutting back flights to Australia. Perhaps the magic of the Emirates reputation is starting to fade, with this type of attitude it is likely to fade further.",Detractor

" Very disappointing flight with Emirates. Started at the airport with unfriendly Check In staff. We travelled as a couple and had together 85 kg luggage. 5kg overloaded. 80kg were permitted. With no discussion, I had to remove stuff to my hand luggage. Up in the air when it was the dessert service, I was full so I asked for just some cheese and fruit. The FA said no, you can only can choose one! Cheese or fruits! Are you kidding me? This is the first time that this has happened to me. I've been a frequent business and first class traveller for almost 20 years and have had mostly the opposite experience. In business class even when you are still hungry, you can have more food/desserts whenever you want. After that I went to the Sky bar (which is a nice feature of EK A380) and saw many fruits and more snacks. Very illogical. The FA who denied me my fruit, I saw her mostly in back galley, eating and chit chatting. It's the first time I have travelled with Emirates and maybe the last time.",Detractor

" Cape Town to London via Dubai. Budget long haul airline. Starving hungry on a 9.5 hour flight. No movie snacks served. Nothing except a standard lunch after take off and then a disgusting vegetable baked good just before landing. 7 hours daytime flying with no food. What a joke. On the next leg from Dubai dinner was a turkey ham roll and that was it for 7 hours until an inedible breakfast was offered. Cheese and cracker with breakfast? Demonstrative of the lack of care and attention by emirates. Dirty planes. Smelly toilets. I will never fly Emirates again. How reviewers are consistently rating Emirates above BA is beyond me and as we know BA is hardly a high benchmark. A massive TV screen and a large selection of films does not make up for a budget service. The cabin crew now start cleaning the plane before it lands, collecting blankets, etc. When the cabin crew start taking on the cleaners role you know things have gone bad.",Detractor

" Due to my business trip I had to travel from Copenhagen Kastrup airport to Dubai and then back to Warsaw to catch my next flight from there. So first part of trip was operated by A380. During Online process I realized there is no more windows seats available. During checkin on the airport I've asked to window seat and I got this seat in emergency row. Also my baggage has been sent without extra costs (I had extra 6kg). At the terminal I've paid to lounge contracted with Emirates airline but it wasn't worth this price (250 DKK, around 33EUR). Boarding at the gate was late around 30 minutes but during this process there was good order, people was queued in the groups. Service on board was good but nothing special comparing to other airlines, meal choice was poor (only dishes with rice). Very good and very stable entertainment system with big selection of movies and games. Also GSM and WIFI network available onboard (I didn't use them at all due to nice passengers travelling next to me, we talked all the time). I land around midnight so traffic wasn't big and all security and luggage pickup in Dubai takes not much (around 1 hour). My flight back to Warsaw was 2 two days later at 8:05. I tried to check-in to choose my seat but it wasn't possible. During my way to the airport I've got an SMS with info I had been seated in the middle. So I went to the airport around 3:30AM and very quickly drop my luggage and pass all security to avoid waiting. It wasn't possible to change my seat, however they seat me in emergency row again. Unfortunately I had been charged for an extra 6 kilos in luggage. Security control was terrible long, they try to find something in my bag but they didn't tell me what they are looking for. I was more clever than on my previous flight and I've put all my cables in checked luggage before to avoid cables confiscated like on my previous flight. I don't understand why ethernet cable is dangerous at Dubai airport but it's ok on all other airports around the world. Inside the airport I found hundreds of people seating and lying on the floor and making passing very difficult in some areas. Whole airport was looking like dormitory for the homeless. Wifi I found overloaded, there was many disconnections during my use. During boarding there was a big mess, airport staff didn't queue people in groups before they start, boarding started 15 minutes after scheduled time. Flight was operated by Boeing 777 and I found seats are more tight than in A380. This travel was terribly uncomfortable. Also I found all meals are with potatoes on this flight (again no choice) and service good but average. All cabin staff on both flights tried to be nice. I arrive very tired. In Warsaw Emirates was 15 minutes late and they passed my luggage to next operator without any problems.",Detractor

" Malta to Male via Dubai. Complaint related to irresponsible staff and left without food for the flight from Malta to Male. I suffer from severe celiac condition and I am intolerant for any type of wheat and contamination. My father who booked the flights did not know that he had to book Gluten free meals 48 hours in advance, when we arrived at the airport in Malta, we asked at the check-in counter about gluten free meals and they informed us that the only way to get gluten free meals on board was to reserve the meals 48 hours in advance. We discussed with the inflight staff and asked them if they can spare some meat from the business class meals and the flight attended said that that was not possible. When we landed in Cyprus we asked to talk to the flight purser and she said she will see what she can do, Once we left Larnaka-Cyprus to Dubai, we asked if the crew managed to solve the issue, but they said unfortunately not and there was nothing they can do, they said that they informed Dubai so they can prepare food for the next flight, again I was left hungry on the flight between Larnaka-Cyprus and Dubai. My Father offered to pay extra for the business class food, but the staff said no. When we landed in Dubai, the first thing we done was to go to customer help and information desk and asked if the crew have ordered any Gluten free food for the next flight from Dubai to Male, the desk assistant said that there was nothing on the system and she will try and get some gluten free food on-board the next flight but she said she cannot promise.

" Barcelona to Jakarta via Dubai. Emirates online and ground services got it wrong all the way. Going from Barcelona to Jakarta we had planned a stopover in Dubai, we had an hotel for the night and the second flight the day after. So we could travel in eco without being too tired. Unfortunately for us Emirates messed up multiple times. The flight was delayed, that might be a normal safety measure. But then we got no information or wrong information all the way. It's a wrong strategy to do so with Emirates, as they can mess up your trip fully, and won't give you more than a poor meal (free poor meal). They can tell you that you will get refunded for your additional expenses and then decline later. All the way to Jakarta, we asked to sleep in Dubai, in Emirates lounge maybe? Explaining we were losing our hotel. The day of departure, after delay notification: Support chat: â€œI don't knowâ€. Emirates Barcelona ground service: â€œI can't give you anything in Dubai, you should ask there. But you will get the 600 euros indemnity each for severe delay, it should cover all your expenses, in case anyway."" At Emirates Dubai ground service: â€œHi, can we sleep somewhere? We are really tired? - Here is your meal voucher. - But we would like to sleep, we are tired, we are not hungry, really. Can we go to the lounge, maybe? - Yeah.. maybe, try there, here is your meal voucherâ€. We needed to sleep, we paid the hotel in the airport, around 200 USD. We do the online complaint to Emirates.

" I travelled with my family from Dubai to Mauritius and what I did not like was the conduct of the staff near the end of the flight. The flight attendant came and collected the blankets 45 minutes before the landing and she did that in a firm way, like there was no discussion. I gave her mine (even though I am very cold whenever an AC is on) and had to ask her to let my daughter keep it. She said yes in a way like she was doing a favour to me. Then the lady next seat told her that she needed to keep the blanket, because she was sick and the flight attendant had a back and forth with her until she conceded at the end. Then after that, she came for the headphones 35 minutes before the landing with an almost rude attitude. My daughter and I were nearly finishing our movie and wanted to tell her that, but then I was watching around and no one was saying anything - I felt like I would be the only one complaining. I gave her both headphones and sat there for 30 minutes thinking about this flight. After all, leaving a blanket and a headphone for the passenger until the end of the flight is not asking too much.

"  Munich to Adelaide via Dubai. The first flight from Munich to Dubai was excellent. Traveling alone with my 10 month old son, the cabin crew were amazing. Introduced themselves personally and took my son for walks through the plane, gave him a meal & toys, and took a Polaroid keepsake. The flight wasnt full so I had the 4 seats to myself with the bassinet and when someone moved to the aisle seat after takeoff, Natasha said she would find the passenger an alternative seat for both our comfort levels (which was unnecessary but great). Unfortunately, the Dubai-Adelaide leg was terrible. I waited nearly 1.5 hours after takeoff to get the bassinet put up, then during the flight which was really turbulent (not much can be done about that I know), I had to buzz for my food trays to be removed as they sat there for a few hours. An elderly man was I'll in the toilet near where I was seated, and had opened the door whilst doubled over the sink vomiting, so again I buzzed for assistance for him but nobody even came! 2 female crew had an argument in the aisle about 1 getting a food order wrong, and it was just very unprofessional. Had it not been for the assistance of the passenger on the aisle and behind me helping me to reach the overhead compartment etc as i needed nappies and things during the flight, but had my son in my arms for almost 10 of the 12 hours due to the turbulence so was attempting to function using 1 hand, the flight would have been a worse experience.

" Brisbane to Nairobi via Dubai. My husband and I flew with Emirates for the first time and had negative experiences on both flights, there and back. The negative was in Dubai when we were waiting for our second flight. We were told boarding would start 40 minutes before departure and would close 20 minutes before departure. Approximately 50 minutes before departure was the first time the flight was shown on the departure screen with ""FINAL CALL"". We had to run to get to the gate on time as we thought we would miss our flight. When we arrived I asked why they started boarding so early and why there was no announcement for boarding until ""FINAL CALL"" and the hostess replied ""It's protocol"". We received no explicit reason or justification whatsoever. The second was in Nairobi. Their system was down which is understandable that queues were extremely long and service taking a long time as well. However, we received absolutely no announcements as to what was happening and when the flight would take off. We were meant to fly at 10:45pm. After boarding at approximately that time we sat on the plane at the gate for 3 hours until we finally took off at 1:45am the next morning. On that flight I pushed the service button for water as we weren't given anything for those 3 hours waiting on the plane but no one answered my request. I did this twice until I gave up. This wait and level of service was extremely frustrating to most passengers as they had connecting flights with short layovers. I was very disappointed with the service and lack of explanation by Emirates on this trip. I am not planning on flying with them again.",Detractor

" Glasgow to Hong Kong return via Dubai on Boeing 777-300 and A380. Very average experience all round, all flights on time and did what they said they'd do. Marked deterioration in service standards since I last flew them two years ago - no hot towels, drinks came after meals finished, second meal basically one mouthful and IFE nowhere near as extensive as advertised on their website. Cabin crew wholly unmemorable. All in all, unremarkable and uninspiring but got from A to B. Would fly again if price good and times worked, but wouldn't go out of my way to do so.",Passive
" Dubai to Brisbane. Would never travel with Emirates again with an infant! Dreadful experience with Emirates travelling with our 20-month-old daughter. Flight crew were rude and unhelpful throughout the entire flight. The only time we ever saw them is when they came and barked orders at us!! We purchased 3 full-price seats for myself, my wife and our 20-month-old daughter, however the flight crew didn't offer our daughter any food during the entire 14-hour flight. When we asked the attendant if they had any food for our infant they said they didn't have any and we should have pre-ordered this! However this was the first we'd heard of this, and the lady sat next to us said that she didn't pre-order and her 4-year-old was given a kids meal! Emirates were well aware that we were travelling with an infant so surely they would have some provisions for this! Apparently not. I have flown hundreds of times and used most airlines - this was definitely the worst experience I've ever had.",Detractor
" Dubai to Istanbul. Cost reductions in Emirates. This is my 4th flight in a month where Emirates only served chicken for a meal. This is my second review and will keep posting as I am a frequent traveler to Dubai. The host attendant told me their classic sentence ""Sorry sir we ran out of beef"". As I was expecting this answer I stand up and asked her ""How come no one in front 5-6 did not get any beef?"". She just could not give a logical answer other than that there is a ratio based on customers. I told her that this is a lie as it's my fourth flight I get the same response from them. Besides, I don't understand why do they give you the menu as they never have beef meal on board? It is very obvious that Emirates is doing cost reduction by serving chicken instead of beef. I have another return flight scheduled in a week. I wonder what will I get.",Passive

" London to Brisbane via Dubai. Our flight from London Heathrow was late, which resulted in us rushing through the transit to book in for the next connecting flight from Dubai to Brisbane (via Singapore). When we arrived at the Dubai check in, it was apparent that there was something wrong but the Emirates staff just talked amongst themselves. After some 15 or 20 other passengers checked in after us for the same flight (5 of them Business Class customers) the Emirates staff told us that they had changed our seats and we couldn't sit together, but they offered no reason for this, I told the staff that we had booked these seats and my partner was a nervous flyer so we could not sit in separate locations. They said you have no choice, I asked to be upgraded to 1st class, they refused, I offered to travel on the next flight 02.30hrs (some 5 hours later), I was abruptly told that our luggage was on the flight that we were originally booked on (21.15hrs) and we needed to board that flight as it was departing in a few minutes. Their attitude for Business Class customers (or any customer) was deplorable. We arrived at Brisbane, but our luggage didn't, the staff at Brisbane were helpful but couldn't tell us where it was, as it hadn't been 'scanned in' at Dubai. I then got access to text messages on my mobile phone, which I couldn't obtain whilst on the flights, for some reason, the text read 'due to operational reasons we have had to transfer you to the flight that departs from Dubai at 02.30hrs', why didn't the staff at Dubai know about this instead of refusing me travel on this service, especially when I had offered to do just that. We waited at Brisbane, for the next flight to arrive, but still no luggage. It took Emirates 3 days to get our luggage to us, by this time we had travelled to Cairns as this was how we had booked our holiday and accommodation. On our return flight to London, which departed from Melbourne, we checked in and the staff said 'due to the flight being full we have changed your seats', from Dubai to London. I couldn't understand why this would be necessary just because the flight was full, again I refused this and asked to be upgraded, no was the reply. We then had to wait at the customer service desk and they eventually explained that they had e mailed Dubai and we had got our original seats, although the staff pointed out to me that the seats were only a request and not guaranteed, I showed them an email from Emirates which confirmed the flight and seat details, from the outset of the booking. The Emirates customer service desk operative made a point that she had done us a favour, in getting our original seats back. When we arrived at Dubai check in, again we were faced with 'we have changed your seats'. I couldn't believe this and again had to wait and argue to get our original seats. The staff on the plane were very attentive and polite on all legs, but the staff on the ground just don't care, rude and not worthy of the Emirates uniform. I asked several times 'how much do you want me to pay before you start giving us some level of service' I have written to Emirates with the complaint and incredibly they have referred it to Qantas, because Emirates were only operating the flight on their behalf, how that works when it was the Emirates staff who caused the issues I don't know.",Detractor
" Istanbul to Dubai. For the third time in a row, Emirates served only chicken meal to me on their flight. Their general excuse is ""Sorry sir but we ran out of beef"". This was my third flight in 2 months where I got the same reply. First I thought it was just my bad luck being related to the seat I have chosen. But I always pay extra for my seat selection and this time I had chosen the front section of the plane. Oddly enough I noticed that all the passengers on my front and back were also very angry about being forced to eat chicken. I will be also posting my next flight info which is scheduled for this Friday. I hope Emirates Passenger Services will take the necessary actions and correct this problem.",Passive
" Manchester to Singapore via Dubai. We flew Emirates on each leg of our trip to Singapore. The first leg on Sunday 25th November 2018 (Manchester -Dubai) was excellent, the crew were attentive and very pleasant. The next leg (Dubai-Singapore) was less pleasant the crew less attentive. The return flights (8th December)were much more unpleasant the aircraft was full on both legs but that should not have had any bearing on the complete lack of interest that the crew displayed. On the first leg my wife felt as though she was about to vomit, I went with her to the back of the plane and asked a member of the crew for some advice (He was chatting to two other crew members at the time) his response was to point to a toilet at the rear and said â€œSick bags in the restroomâ€ no other concern was expressed. The leg from Dubai to Manchester was over night leaving Dubai at 2.55am for at least three hours we saw no crew at all, anything we needed had to be requested by a visit to the curtained off galley. Overall we were extremely disappointed by the standard of service, far less than we expected. The uniforms of the crew are probably the smartest in the business but along with this must go an equivalent level of customer service. This was our first trip with Emirates but I expected far more from them than this. Good clean aircraft, food only so-so, good timekeeping but oh dear! The level of service fell far below what should be a standard.",Passive

" Los Angeles to Colombo via Dubai. Worst airline. Flight staff was horrible and rude. I tried to asked why I kept getting food with dietary restrictions when I have none. On the flight home they assured me nothing was noted for special diet and sure enough on the 17 hour flight I had nothing since I don't eat fish and that's what I was served for my â€˜dietary restrictions' - two out of the four flights the seat did not recline. WiFi was not working on any flight. Finally was able to talk to someone and they gave us info on who to contact. Almost 6 months later with over 8 attempts to contact company to see if they would be able to listen to our concerns and issues we experienced - nothing. Their customer service over the phone is even worse. I'm not one to give a bad review but when you're spending thousands of dollars and give almost 6 months for the company to hear me out and make it right, I need to warn other people.",Detractor
" Kuala Lumpur to London via Dubai. First time flying Emirates. I flew coach, my flight left KLIA at 7.40pm to Dubai (7 hours) 3rd Dec 2018. Flight EK347. Seated upfront 2nd row Economy. Presumable friends, the first row 3 male passengers were making so much noise throughout the night flight. No one could sleep in my section. Being a night flight, the Emirates staff not only failed to request them to tone down in consideration to other passengers. But what shocked most passengers is to see one of the Emirates staff is part of the noise making throughout the flight with the 3 men. Seated herself at the crew exit seat facing them. Extremely unprofessional for any staff to act in this manner by disregarding passengers comfort. Next, the food was poorly presented. Budget airlines like AirAsia has better food. Service is below average. Cabin crew comprising of multi nationalities don't seem to be working as a team. Next, the seats were extremely uncomfortable. Sorry, I wouldnt fly Emirates again, and will go back to Asian airline hospitality. Highly overrated airline.",Detractor
" Kuala Lumpur to London via Dubai. Having a stopover at Dubai now enroute to London. Decided to check on why Emirates was below expectation. Initially wanted to keep my experience to myself but not after reading Skytrax reviews on Emirates. First and foremost, I was allotted the worst seat anyone can get. Seat 66H, the lavatory seat. Wrote to Emirates 3 days back, I am in Dubai now, my flight is done, but no response from them. Luckily upon online check-in, I decided to change my ""aromatic"" seat - and I had to pay extra for a different seat. Emirates should not sell or make money from this row of seats. Esp when there are still empty seats on the flight for sale or seat change for extra payment. Its downright unacceptable and disgusting from a country that prides itself to be super rich operating the 2nd largest A380 fleet. I know now, I was fooled by all of Emirates advertisements and their perceived image. On to the flight, the flight was below expectation. Economy class cabin crews' attention and attitude got heaps to improve. Giving me the immediate impression that Emirates only crave and care for Business and First Class passengers attention, I guess Economy class passengers are only herds of cattle to them. The food was bland and presentation was poor. And the Emirates A380 economy seat is very uncomfortable Someone should remind Emirates management, that Economy class service ultimately differentiates an airline from its competitors and generates the most revenue for any airline Anyone wants to fly Emirates? fly Business or First, never Economy.",Detractor
" Oslo to Dubai. Have flown with Emirates several times and this is by far the worst experience ever. The crew took a long time to serve dinner and by the time it got to us, they had already run out of beef, and we weren't even sitting towards the back of the plane. No apology was given for the limited choices and the FA gave a take it or leave it tone with us. The snack was served shortly after and no one bothered to collect the trash from us after that. One FA told us to leave it behind. Unprofessional service!",Passive

Controller of mini screen don't come out, ask crew member to help, she pressed several times and replied â€œif you can't take it out I can't tooâ€. Asked whether we want chicken or beef, we said beef, crew member say I will take a look and never come back again. Asked another crew member, he told the previous one that she has missed us, she snapped and walk away. In the end no food was served. I know it's economy class but I don't think we deserve this.",Detractor

We boarded on time and even though it was a busy service (full business class) we were very well looked after by a professional cabin crew. Food and wines offered on the nearly 7 hour flight was very good and of highest standard. We even had time to enjoy a cocktail at the bar and relax before we started our descent into Hamburg.

When my husband asked him again what he was saying then only he's explaining either we pay or throw our stuff for 21 kgs. This is lack of professionalism to me. Not only that, the supervisor was rude too. Without a smile and arrogantly he said either you pay or you throw then he walked away. We all know this but at least display a professional and appropriate manners towards us. We ended up paying 5kg excess. I bought a return ticket for the first time and this should be my last.

" Newark to Athens. When we received the email from Emirates to check in we were offered an upgrade to Business for $600 per person. We took it, thinking that we would be wowed by Emirates world class service, food and reputation. Read on. After checking in online we called to find out more about Emirates' car service, knowing we were outside the 50 mile radius we were willing to pay the difference. ""No' we were told, ""you booked the super saver upgrade, so you are not eligible"". Really? Even if we would pay for it? After we checked in at the airport we asked where the lounge was located. ""No"" we were told ""you booked the super saver upgrade, so that doesn't get lounge access"". Funny, didn't see mention of that when Emirates took my $1200. (we got into the lounge any way). Boarded an old 777-200. It was late (almost midnight). We had a nice cocktail and dinner and went to sleep. Forgot to put the sticker on my shirt and so 2 hours before landing, and in the middle of a nice deep sleep, was awoken by the FA who asked what I wanted for breakfast (even though he could see I was sound asleep). My husband was out like a light and the FA said ""I guess he doesn't want breakfast"". Astute observation. Before I went to sleep and after I woke up I tried to find something to watch on the IFE. Nothing. It was late so there was no question that we would be sleeping, but the seat was not full flat and the hard arm rests were hard to maneuver around. Overall I would say that I was glad we got to upgrade, but felt sorry for those folks who paid a lot more than we did for the same experience.",Passive

" Dubai to Houston. I have never experienced such a complete & total lack of professionalism, by any airline. Travelers can encounter a problem on any airline, but it is how an airline handles a problem that is most important. This experience on EK was a ""case study in abject incompetence"". The flight was boarded on time, but departure time came & went, & passengers were left sitting, with zero flight deck contact for almost 1.5 hours before the 1st contact by The Captain. There had been a problem with a smoke detector in the crew's sleeping cabin, but it would soon be fixed & we would be ""on our way in about 15 minutes"". Yet again, we sat with no update k for over another hour, by which time the flight was 2.5 hours late. The Captain then made a 2nd announcement that it had taken longer to fix the problem than anticipated, but we would ""now depart in about 10-15 minutes"". However, for a 3rd time, passengers were left sitting another 1+ hour with no flight deck contact. What kind of flight crew training does EK provide, where a Captain thinks it is OK to let passengers sit in silence on a flight delayed 3+ hours, yet make only 2 incorrect announcements? After sitting for 3.5 hours the Captain direct all passengers to collect their belongings & deplane. So 100's of passengers deplane, but those in 1st & Business Class on the upper deck had another surprise waiting. Neither the Captain, or the flight crew had alerted ground staff that upper deck passengers had been directed to deplane. As a result, all 1st & Business Class passengers were crammed at the end of the jetway in front of the 2nd floor elevators, with no place to go! Passengers could enter the elevators, but security had disabled the floor selection buttons after the plane had originally boarded. Passengers started to bang on the glass walls to try & get the attention of security staff who could be seen in the distance, but unable to hear through the heavy glass walls. Passengers finally returned to the plane to tell the ""totally clueless"" flight crew, there was no place to go & passengers were trapped in the small 2nd floor area. Security personnel finally noticed passengers banging on the wall & 1 unlocked a 5th floor door & came to the 2nd level via stairwell, since they also could not operate the elevators. This employee then directed all 1st & Business Class passengers to carry all their belongings up 6 flights to the 5th floor Business Class Lounge! What a fiasco of total incompetence. The flight ended up being 5.5 hours late, but once airborne, passengers quickly learned that even though the plane had sat at the gate for almost 6 hours, it had not been re-catered, so the flight was serving a ""breakfast"" menu, even though the flight departed at almost 4:00PM. No dinner would be served, but rather a light snack, since the menu was still for the ""original"" flight times. After flying for 25 years, I have never experienced a more incompetent flight operation. Not 1 EK employee mentioned any compensation, even though passengers should have received some type of compensation!",Detractor
" I traveled from Trivandrum to Dallas via Dubai to visit my 94 year old dad who was in critical condition in the hospital. However, he passed away the night before my flight. I was forced to change my return from November 14 to November 8 as my dad's funeral was on November 5. I had a 20 hour layover in Dubai on my return and Emirates was to provide me hotel and meals in Dubai on my scheduled return date of November 14. However, even though I used the exact same flight combination for my return from TVM to Dubai and Dubai to DFW on November 8, Emirates refused to provide me hotel and meals at Dubai. I had to pay an extra $85 for hotel and approximately $50 for meals. As it is, I paid $1,609.54 originally for the ticket which I thought was overpriced and an additional $375 in penalties and fare difference for changing my return date. I am left wondering whether Emirates is in the business of providing air transportation or of highway robbery. I have traveled on Emirates previously and I definitely got the feeling that not only are they nickel and diming their passengers but their cabin and ground crew at DFW service are much worse than before.",Detractor

" Madrid to Male via Dubai. I have never flown Emirates until last October 27 in a holiday trip with my wife to Maldives. Madrid to Male was nothing special: economy seats have average pitch, ICE system works fine and movies selection is huge apparently. Service onboard was quite bad, food was average, flight attendants were rude, the purser spent the whole flight shouting at the crew. They never asked if we wanted more bread or more cafe etc. The flight from Dubai to Male was scheduled at 3:15 am, so we wanted nothing but sleep. Even if we put on all of our ""resting stuff"" the flight crew woke up us at 5 am for breakfast. She said that she must assure that everyone on board was offered breakfast. On our return flights we found another surprise. As the travel agency gave us the booking reference two months ago I purchased the seats, as the fare the agency took did not allow to choose seats. I paid 140â‚¬ for the seats. So far so good until we checked in at Male airport. Our seats were changed with no reason. In both flights (MLE-DXB and DXB-MAD). The handling staff could not tell me any reasonable reason, and the finished with a great ""ask Emirates staff when you arrive to Dubai"". Great answer from a professional employee. But when I tried to get an explanation at Dubai my luck did not get better: after twenty minutes trying to hold a conversation, one person who supposedly was in charge gave me a piece of paper with a web site written and told me to fill an online claim. Great airline, great staff, great service. Onboard more of the same: bad service, rude crew, poor food and added to my other trip: my entertainment system did not work. Luckily I had my ipad with lots of stuff loaded. This was my first and my last trip with Emirates.",Detractor

Just going down a short list: I expected better seat comfort, I hoped for more attention from the flight attendants (this was a 14 hour flight with only one visit by a flight attendant in the 14 hrs, that being after they served the meals). There were many, many children and some would not stop crying. The few bathrooms became dirty fast and stayed that way through the flight. Finally, the food was mediocre at the best.

Several requests for drinks etc were misunderstood, because it seemed that the crew were making incorrect assumptions about what I wanted, instead of taking the time to ask and listen!

I was disappointed by my experience. When I booked the ticket thru my travel agent, my seat is always classified as Confirmed as seen by online tracking. So to my very surprise, when I got to the Stansted Airport check in counter 3 hours before my flight departure, the staff at the check in counter told me that I was actually a â€œstand byâ€ passenger from Dubai to Hong Kong which they could not actually check me in and print my boarding pass, they said I could only confirm my seat when I arrive Dubai and they could do nothing in Stansted. I said to them that my seat status is always written as Confirmed on online tracking and I could not accept such an uncertainty only to find out if I will get a seat to Hong Kong when I arrive Dubai. The staff only explained because the plane was overbooked and I was chosen (randomly?). I had flown numerous airlines in my life, but such thing was never happened, but only with Emirates!

" Barcelona to Dubai. A cabin crew damaged my belongings. Just before the captain commenced descent, against my advice, staff shoved and crushed several of my airport purchases into a almost full overhead compartment above me, in my full view. Prior to this, I'd request twice for assistance to find a suitable space, not the one above me, but my request was totally ignored. Upon landing for disembarkment, I approached the cabin crew supervisor and showed him the damages done on my purchases by one of his crew. He expressed his apologies and advised I write in to Emirates as there nothing other than apologies he can offer. He was also shown the almost-full state of the compartment directly above us where the packagings were crushed and damaged. I wrote to Emirates and below is their ""not my problem"" template reply from Customer Service Thank you for your correspondence of 03 October 2018 regarding Emirates flight EK 186 from Barcelona to Dubai on 29 September. I regret to learn that you found your biscuit box dented on the above flight. However, I am required to highlight that personal belongings brought onboard are the responsibility of each individual passenger, and the airline cannot accept responsibility for loss of, or damage to, personal items. According to our records, as you were sitting in the bulkhead row, you were advised that all bags and loose items have to be stowed for landing in the overhead lockers. It is my understanding that you did not inform the cabin crew that your bags contained fragile items. Notwithstanding the above, we certainly appreciate you bringing your experience to our attention, and I wish to assure you that your comments, along with the Cabin Supervisor's report, have been shared with the departments concerned. This enables them to take appropriate internal action to improve the standard of service offered to our customers. I can also advise that the cabin crew operating in Economy class on this flight have received guidance in this regard. Please accept my apologies for not having met your expectations on this occasion. I hope that we can leave you with a more positive impression on your future flights with us.

" Orlando to Hargeisa via Dubai. I was traveling for business purposes, so I needed to take 6 bags and was willing to pay the extra fees for the many overweight pieces of baggage. I agreed to pay $950 for the baggage to be accepted and taken to my destination, which was Hargeisa. When I got to Dubai, they canceled my connection flight to Hargeisa, so they rescheduled me onto an Ethiopian Airline flight to Hargeisa, which I was fine with, but later I wanted a refund because, in order for my bags to reach the destination, I had to pay $1600 to Ethiopian Airlines, and the agreement with Emirates was to take my baggage to my destination for the $950. I asked Emirates for a refund because they canceled the flight and rescheduled me, but they refused and said it's not their fault and since I paid the $950 and used Emirates airlines until Dubai, they cannot accept my refund.",Detractor
"  Sydney to Paris via Dubai. I have been travelling with Emirates with the past 10 years. I flew for the second time in business class and the service has been the worst I have ever had. A had a stop over in Dubai, and I had a confirmation email from Emirates and a print out from the Emirates counter in Sydney while I did my check-in. A chauffeur was booked to pick me and my daughter up and we had a hotel room booked complimentary from Emirates. When we arrived in Dubai, no one from Emirates helped me to find my chauffeur. I went to the Emirates counter and the person who was really unhelpful, cancelled my booking without asking me anything and was very rude! I had to wait for hours at the airport with my 17 months daughter. I was expecting much more from the business class from Emirates. The cabin crew during the flights was average. While my daughter was sleeping I asked one one of the crew to look after her while I was in the bathroom. She showed me that she was really annoyed to help me, she finally decided to stay as I asked her if I could get someone else to help me if she didn't want to do it. The cabin crew was eating food in front of clients and was not in a hurry to help clients. I sent a complain on the Emirates website and they answered that it will take up to 30 days before I hear from them - this unacceptable. The business class is expensive enough to deserve the treatment that goes with it. I will never book another business flight ticket with Emirates anymore.",Detractor

" Jakarta to London via Dubai. I'm shocked by how terrible the service was. The in flight entertainment is arguably one of the best, the food is okay (nothing special but good enough), but the service provided by the flight attendants was absolutely appalling. I received no help whatsoever from the stewardess nearby in loading/unloading my baggage, even though I was clearly seen struggling. I was very thirsty mid-flight and requested for the flight attendant to ask for water, but unfortunately no one showed up. The general attitude was unfriendly and unenthusiastic. I would absolutely opt for alternative airlines (and there are plenty) when making this trip in the future.",Detractor

Qantas was far superior.",Detractor
  Manchester to Mauritius via Dubai. First flight with Emirates. Not impressed. On outward and inward flights our choice of meals were not available. On return flight sea food only available. I'm allergic to this so did not have a meal. No amenity kits were available despite all flights being long haul. I enquired via live chat if I could take a hand bag and a small piece of cabin luggage before I flew. I was told strictly one piece only per person. Most ladies had a hand baggage and a travel bag with them. Travelled with golf bags and only were allowed 30kg including suitcases. Most other airlines allow much more than this. Not impressed at all.,Detractor
" Dubai to Johannesburg. Emirates is a joke. We were given a ""E"" and ""F"" seats at check in, on a horribly tight 3-4-3 configuration. We asked if we could be given a window or aisle seat but was refused. The check in staff then called her supervisor and said ""Hi, I am calling as two passengers would like to change their seats. I want to call because I want to let them know I have put in my effort and you can just say a no so I can please them"". This is humiliating. On the flight, the seats were the tightest I have met in economy class. The highly rated ICE system was a joke - they claimed to have over 3000 hours of inflight entertainment but in fact, most movies were the unpopular or old ones. The so called free wifi allowed you for 10 minutes of messaging only. The food is ok, but nothing to cry for. The crews were mostly impolite, and even for the polite ones, not proactive to help on anything. We had a tight connection (1 hour which we need to collect our bags and recheck again) and asked if we could be seated to the front of the aircraft for quick disembarkation. One of the crews ignored our requests and the one other one just said, ""oh, do it on your own"". This is the most horrible flight I have had with international flights!",Detractor
"  I have flown with Emirates over several years but I won't be after my recent trip to the UK. On both legs (to Birmingham/return to Melbourne) the service left a lot to be desired after many years of excellent service. My wife who had asked for diabetic meals (in advance) had white rolls/sandwiches given to her - as was the diabetic passenger - next to her. They both explained to the staff that brown bread is what they had asked for as white bread is a no-no for those suffering with diabetes. Most of the other contents of the meals were not conducive with those with diabetes. The ""hot"" meals were late in there delivery on most occasions. There was obviously something wrong as staff members were arguing with one another saying who was at fault or wasn't. Either way, it wasn't very professional and disappointing for the customers to hear this going on - I was seating in the row in front of the cabin crew prepare the meals. I wouldn't have minded if it had only happened the once but it happened on our return flight. One has to ask why is moral so low with the Emirates air crew on Emirates these days? Why should passengers be bearing the toxic atmosphere and second rate customer service. Until there management (who the buck stops at) get there act together, I won't be rushing back to them when there are better air crews to fly with! I didn't get an apology (neither did anyone else) off the flying crew as to why it took 50 - 60 minutes to disembark from the plane?",Detractor
" Sydney to Athens via Dubai. Emirates is an overpriced airline with too much marketing budget and no substance, one that I would advise others to never fly on unless they have no other options. The flight was bad, but not funny or interesting experience bad - just depressing and frustrating and not worth the money you pay for it. My food wasn't served until 6 hours into the flight (on my side of the aisle, the other side got served an hour or two earlier), attendants did not respond to the call button, and when they did serve you they did not speak, smile or even respond with a ""yes or no"" (when asked to bring water). Which was strange considering that had two shifts on board - so there was a lot of attendants wandering around, but none of them seemed to be working. The attendants ended up being more of a nuisance than service - because there were so many of them, they used the passenger's overhead bins in my area (4-5 bins, about 5 rows both sides) for their items and passengers were left with no space. In an attempt to hire as many nationalities as possible, the crew had no cohesion or chemistry - they split off into sub groups based on nationality/language and spent most of the flight gossiping and chatting with their friends. There was audible laughter when the screen popped up with a ""what did you think of this flight"", followed by several ""terrible"" from the rows in front and behind us. The in-flight entertainment system was dated and old",Detractor
" Frankfurt to Cebu via Dubai. We booked through a travel agency which gave us separate bookings for every person. Online Check-in should be standard and Emirates offers it. However, the Website is hard to navigate and it takes ages to load. Then, two of us (two out of five) could not check in online. So we went to the airport and checked in the classic way. We were checking in four hours prior to departure. The first Check-in agent was really friendly, but unfortunately, she handed us over to a colleague who was rude. We tried to get seats near each other, she said no seats available. There are hundreds of people in the queue behind us and you tell us they all have seats and you can't change it? They didn't all do the online check-in because there were seperate queues. So we don't get seats near each other, okay. We go to the gate and there is the next problem: There is a pre-boarding area. They had to get us out of there two hours before departure. It was a mess. There, they could suddenly magically change our seats. So ground service seems to be good or bad depending on your fortune. So the flight was normal. Legroom was okay but not outstanding. Recline of the seat wasn't working. The meal was great. IFE had a awesome choice, but unfortunately there was two minutes of ads before every film. When we arrived in DXB, we went to the costumer service to ask if we could get seats near each other since we were spread all over the plane. The staff was again rude and not motivated at all. She said she could not do anything for us. We got to the gate and picked up some free ice cream form Emirates (That was great, keep it up!) on the way. There was again this strange kind of first stage boarding. It was a mess. When I got my boarding pass scanned, the agent told me I've got an upgrade. Now, I don't want to complain about the upgrade, but why didn't they tell us at costumer service? They scanned our boarding passes there, and all in all three of us five go an upgrade, one of which had a gluten free meal. So they have planned the upgrade in advance. If they would have told us, we wouldn't have spent two hours on the floor. Onboard, the Business Class was in a 2-3-2 configuration with angled flat beds. If I had paid money for this Business Class, I would have been mad at myself to not have flown any other airline. The FAs were polite, but not going out of there way to be polite. The meal was good. No FA passed through to take care of passengers except for the meal times. This is below standard as well as the seat. In the IFE, there is the same ad as in Eco. All in all, I don't recommend paying for this.",Passive
" All sectors Kuala Lumpur to Gatwick via Dubai were on time. A380 cabin was spacious, spotless clean and the inflight entertainment was one of the best, no doubt. Inflight catering was above good and the portion was generous. The crew service was a big let down. Meals service took longer than expected as the flight was 99% full. Crews were unenthusiastic and clearly not interested in assisting passengers luggage during boarding and de-boarding. I chose this Airline for connectivity else I would pay slightly more to fly with another carrier.",Passive
" Toronto to Beirut via Dubai. What is the big fuss about Emirates? It was ok, nothing more than other airlines, actually the seat was not comfortable enough (business class) had part of the seat pressing against my arm left bruises that turned blue two days ago. That was because the seats are too narrow. Fly another business class and you will see the difference. Wifi was a trouble to connect to. I must say the A380 as a plane is impressive but the way it was designed inside was not the best. On my 2nd leg of the trip we flew the 777-300ER and what a terrible seating arrangement. I cant believe how they thought of putting the touch pad where you are supposed to put your hand letting you feeling you are tied during the flight. Very bothersome. Whoever is loyal to Emirates, I know they try to accumulate skyward miles, but you guys should fly other airlines business class and you should see what you are missing.

The cabin with the seat is comfortable and giving a great privacy to the travellers. You can easily work, read or relax without being interrupted. A real 1st class service.",Promoter
"  Writing review while in the aircraft to Dubai - EK 762 at 2158 Dubai time (24th September 2018) seat number 9D. Emirates business is deteriorating. 1) Check in: I had to wait at JNB because they were calling economy passengers to Business check in. 2) Lounge: Lounge at JNB quite good. The gentleman at d reception is rude and never smiled. In my over 100 lounge visits this year, never saw someone like him. He was busy on internet checking share prices. 3) Boarding: boarding was ok because boarding started before I came and mine was quick. 4) Flight: This particular business class experience is my worst to date. When I ordered a drink it took 20 mins. When I go to fetch it, the very rustic stewardess tells me she has to follow a certain order. And actually makes me wait another 10 mins before I get my drink. Food was shoddy from the first dish other than the apple tart. When I was sleeping they were celebrating with serving wine and other sweets to different couples, make them wear the funny Emirates hat and six of them including passengers were laughing away to glory while clicking pics. All this as promotion for Emirates when lights are out and people like me are trying to catch some sleep. Economy class, for third the price, offers much better experience. There is a reason why a Singapore or Qatar or Etihad get five star rating while Emirates can only make four. I am pretty convinced not to buy Emirates business class tickets for personal trips.",Detractor

" Dubai to Nairobi. Emirates has been my preferred flying choice for both work and personal even including my family as well. To be treated like the way I was came as a complete shocker since never ever been treated like this prior to this unworthy experience. I had arrived from my flight from Taipei (Flight EK367) and was connecting Nairobi via this flight. I had 4 hours and proceeded to shop at Duty free as mentioned above has been my trend. I had checked in one luggage of 23KG in Taipei.I shopped for Chocolates. Upon heading to the boarding gate, I was stopped by an Emirates staff who demanded I weigh my luggage before boarding. I was irritated as I noticed other passengers boarding without being stopped to and they had more luggage. I assume this must be a routine check. My boarding luggage was 4KG excess. This was understandable considering the duty free items bought. I requested the lady to consider as I had only checked in one luggage and if need be, they check in my luggage. The lady suggested I speak to the gentleman. The gentleman would not hear of it! He was rude and started telling me if I want to complain, I can do that but I have to pay the excess! My luggage cannot be checked in! Since time was running out, I proceeded to pay for the excess luggage of 4KG. Upon waiting to issue my boarding pass, two gentlemen in front of me who were boarding had more luggage and the ladies (Different completely from the one who requested to check) told the gentlemen that they would check in their luggage without even checking how many luggage they originally had checked in! How unfair! When I started to complain, I was told time is running out and should proceed for the aircraft. The whole flight was a mess and I did not enjoy due to me being stressed out and worried about the funds I had paid whilst people in the aircraft had more luggage than me.Is this really fair? I do not mind paying for excess but a fair check has to be done across everyone boarding.",Detractor
 Sydney to Dubai. Emirates will make you pay for an exit row seat and refuse any sort of refund when they move you involuntarily at the last minute due to a broken seat. Unfortunately a very poor experience and I feel cheated out of the extra money i paid for exit row seats. I was told at the boarding gate as I was about to board that my 2 prepaid exit row seats ($360 paid extra on top of my normal ticket) has a broken entertainment unit. The boarding gate staff advised me that they can move me to a normal seat and refund me my $360. I was annoyed but confirmed with the staff member on the spot that he will ensure I get refunded. He assured me he will see to it and moved my allocated seats. 4 weeks has passed with no refund. I contacted Emirates via their website and explained my situation and they refuse to consider a refund - Basically I paid for a service that I did not receive on my booked flight. I will keep following up this matter with Emirates. They do not provide any contact details or means to contact them other than a very restrictive e-form on their website.

Then when we got to the airport the lady who checked us in stated to go to the lounge for us to receive the Wheelchair - when we got there I was disgusted by the service where the lady stated we cannot help you with this and said she didn't have a clue on this service, so My Partner was in even more pain and agony as he had to have this lengthy walk.

" During my flight back home to Singapore from Dubai, I was given 41 A seat, so happy that it's located in exit area seat which means a nice leg room. After almost an hour of flying, I decided to watch using the IFE, known as ICE. I was shocked that my IFE monitor is not working plus my remote control. I even borrowed the control of my seat mate to call the attention of the flight stewardess. After few minutes of ""checking"", they finally give up. After almost an hour again, they offered me to transfer seat. Initially, I'm hesitant because I love my seat and its pretty quiet, but I realized that without entertainment for more than 7 hours of flight will kill me. Now, I find myself at 67G, which is also an ""exit"" seat. When I turned on the IFE, it's working, only to realized that I'm in the middle of the plane which means near the 4 engines which makes my flight uncomfortable.

" Muscat to Guangzhou via Dubai. Everything was good in the inbound flight and there was no issue. On the other hand, my outbound flight had many issues. First of all, the agents who handled the check in were not polite and knowledgeable of English so that they can understand passengers and passengers can understand them. I had an agent who told me that I have 19kg excess baggage while I was sure that I have checked the baggage three times in my hotel and they were with in the limit. I asked the agent to double check and put them on the scale again individually since he was putting them all together and hand calculating the total weight. The agent refused to do so and refused to ask for his supervisor to come and kept saying ""It is Dubai, Check with Dubai"" He was about to return all the bags to me until I make the payment, I told him Ok check the bags and finish the check in so that my family and I will go and do the payment. He said ""first make payment and then will check the bags""! He kept my family standing there with my children and I went to do the payment. When I asked the other agent also to go and check or ask that guy in the counter to check she refused and said the same ""check with Dubai"". I paid the $570 for 19kg which I really think it is ridiculously insane charge for 19kg. In front of the gate, several agents were collecting the carry on bags to check them in for free and they did check all my carry on bags that weighs more than 20kg. Then they asked to take my cabin friendly baby stroller to check in because they where not aware of this type of strollers, although I informed them about it and showed them how it folds but they did not listen and they were unaware of this type of stroller. I purchased this type so that baggage handling dont break my stroller. They lost one of my baggage and I could not get it before the Eid.

On top of all this the seat itself was defective as it would not recline and stay reclined. When I told the pursuer of this issue he said he will refund my money and file a complain but i neither received any refund nor did he show me any filling of any formal complaint. Actually i never saw him again throughout the whole 9 hour flight. At the Duty free airport in Beirut I had purchased some food stuff and other items to hand carry to dubai. When i was boarding the flight from Dubai to the Manila a man stopped me and asked me to weight my hand carry, he said that the hand carry was acceptable since I already brought it from Lebanon but my Duty free items which weighed 7 Kg more was to be charged an additional $35 USD per kilo totalling $245 addition charge.

When I asked for the cause of the delay they claimed that it took time to heat the meal. However, when I ran back to the galley to take sugar for my hot chocolate I found 5 or 6 cabin crew having a meal and chatting together rather than looking after their first class passengers.

 Two more great flights with Emirates from London to Melbourne via Dubai. Check in at Heathrow Terminal 3 was quick and efficient and the lounge was marvellous especially for a plane spotter like myself. Boarding was smooth and a glass of nice Champagne offered before take-off. Staff were efficient and friendly and the food and wine offered were superb. Landed in Dubai and headed to lounge as the next flight to Melbourne departed at 2.20 am. Again a smooth boarding and even at that hour of the day a glass of bubbly was on offer and also the staff handed out hot towels and the mattress for the bed. Breakfast was promptly served and after a movie I slept for about 7 hours and then enjoyed a delicious lunch even though it was closer to dinner time at our destination. The multi national crew were fantastic. I usually ask where they come from and its almost like a mobile United Nations conference.

" Kuwait to Lyon return via Dubai. I usually fly with Qatar Airways in Business class but they don't offer this route yet. I was terribly unsatisfied with Emirates product on these flights. First, the 2-3-2 configuration on their B777-300 is outdated and lacks comfort and privacy. The seats are old and screens often don't work properly. On my flight from Dubai to Kuwait, on the A380, my seat was not even clean and i found toothbrush protection on the cocktail table. Second, on my 4 flights during my trip, only 1 crew was attentive and nice to me. The others were not caring about passengers and were snobby and arrogant. Dinner is served on a tray and food not nicely presented (i'd call it economy in business). As for beverages (I usually drink wine during dinner), you can't expect it to be served after you finished your dinner. The crew were disorganized. Last, the internet on board was not working on any of the segments. I am totally disappointed in this airline which markets itself as one of the best.

There was a variety of gourmet food options(but I did skip some of the meals as I was not hungry). I thoroughly enjoyed the traditional local Arabic mezze entree.

From Dubai to Singapore, have to ask 3 time for a class of coke, in the end after 20 min I got 2 glass of coke - it is not meal serving time it is not busy, cabin crew, busy chattering at the back of the cabin.

" Amsterdam to Male via Dubai. Disappointed. Somehow there is a myth that this is a great airline. Legroom is great as is the entertainment system. But with that all is said on the greatness. Flight delays are badly communicated (both to and from Dubai) and service is really poor. 2-2,5 hrs after take off you get served while having waited at the gate for 2 hrs (1,5 hrs delay) Cart is sitting in the aisle for 1,5 hrs before they start using it. No glass of water offered and on a six hour night flight you don't wait for over two hours to serve drinks or meals. Crew not unfriendly but for far friendly. If I can avoid I won't fly again. Maybe KLM has less legroom and entertainment but the crews are nicer and more attentive. Would advice Emirates to review training and food&beverage setup/process.",Detractor

I have experienced Emirates business class product a few times over the last year and few things have been consistent: poor menu, rushed service, unpersonalized service, rude and poorly trained cabin crew.

 Melbourne to London via Dubai. Early start with EK 409 departing Melbourne at 5.00 am so arrived at airport at 2.30 am to check in. Ground staff were great but warned me that immigration and security would not open until 3.00 am! As you can imagine with a full flight there were hundreds of passengers lined up to go through this process. Was given a priority lane pass which made the progress much easier. Boarding was prompt but could have stayed in the lounge as it had an excellent breakfast menu and great seating. On board was offered a glass of French which at 4.30 am is the only way to start the day. Seat was more than comfortable and the staff were first rate. Breakfast offering after take-off included a healthy option or the more traditional fare of bacon and eggs etc. The crew now use an electronic form on smart devices to take your order. Lunch was served 2 hours from landing and again an excellent choice. Landed on time and after 90 minutes it was off to London on EK 003. Again the crew were welcoming and drinks offered before take off and orders promptly taken when airborne. More food served before landing at London Heathrow and landing was right on time. On each flight passengers are offered a mattress to put on the seat and in some cases an extra pillow. ICE system is brilliant and a great selection to choose from and the cameras on the aircraft are a must watch for landing and take-off. Overall a fantastic long haul experience with friendly crew and great service. Could not recommend more highly.,Promoter
"  New York to Johannesburg via Dubai. I accompanied my teenage son to a short internship in a private conservation area in South Africa. He was tasked with photographing all the researchers operating in that area and therefore had to take expensive photographic gear. We showed that gear to the Emirates check-in manager in New York, who gave us no trouble at all for carrying it on as hand luggage. Leaving Johannesburg, Emirates agents stopped us and the manager treated us terribly, telling us that we couldn't take the gear on the plane, that it was a safety hazard, blah blah. Our checked luggage was very light so we were not over in terms of the weight we were bringing on the flight. He told us that our only option was to sign a liability form and put the lenses in the hold. We might as well have thrown the gear into the street and watched the trucks run over it. This was the day before Christmas, and the airline basically threw us out to find our own way home at holiday time -- even though they had allowed us to fly in. We got no refund. We had to buy same-day tickets home on Delta -- and by the way, our hand luggage did not come even close to falling out of the overhead storage on that airline.

"  Totally disappointed with Emirates on the flights from Manchester to Dubai, and from Dubai to Manchester on the way back. Flights to and from Singapore the cabin crew were very good but airplane was old and some of the touch screens were not working and also the seats were not very good. The experience at Manchester airport was horrendous- that wasn't the airlines fault. Once we got onto plane the plane though the experience didn't improve the stewards and stewardesses looked bored and could not be bothered with passengers. When they did come round it felt as though they were just completing jobs without a care as to how they do it! Also noticed that the kids meals were not presented as they used to be 2 years ago when I last traveled with them. Dubai to Manchester on the 31st of July- firstly flight we had booked was supposed to be from Singapore to Colombo and then to Dubai, they had overbooked and as a result offered us a direct flight from Singapore to Dubai which we didn't have an issue with. Flight from Dubai was a different story the cabin staff looked depressed and really difficult to deal with. You would ask nicely but their responses were really short and every time it was a no! Having had 3 children with us they were given breakfast part of which was cereal, all 3 were given different cereals which caused problems as they all wanted the same one, when the air stewardess was asked if she could check if there was this particular cereal available her answer was no straight away without even checking. Overall we just feel as a family in future we would rather travel long haul with other airlines as Emirates service was terrible and reading reviews we don't appear to be the only ones. Emirates have started offering a saver fare which if you book be aware you will not be able to pre select your seats. Inflight entertainment was some of the worst I had seen - some of the movies were really old!

" London to Manila via Dubai. Here is an airline that has deteriorated in a spectacular fashion. I have flown with Emirates since the late 90's and had not used them recently. I decided to use them this year. What a shock! This was not the Emirates that I used to know and liked immensely. Their aircraft are dirty and their staff, both on the ground and in the air, are inept and downright rude. In my particular case, i originally booked flights from Gatwick to Manila, via a two hour stopover in Dubai. After paying for the flights, Emirates emailed me to say that the schedules had changed and I was now on a flight from Heathrow with a one hour stopover in Dubai. To be honest, i was somewhat wary of such a tight connection time but I (in hindsight) stupidly trusted Emirates to get me to my destination on time. Well, the inevitable happened. The flight from Heathrow was delayed, thus causing me to miss my connecting flight to Manila. Incidentally, having checked this particular flight (EK004), it appears that it has been late departing from Heathrow virtually every evening. I would love to know how many other Manila bound passengers have missed their connection in this way over the last three months. The Emirates ground crew at Dubai were next to useless, accommodating us in a shabby hotel in Dubai for a few hours and then sticking us on a Hong Kong bound flight that evening, to connect with a Philippine Airlines flight the following morning. In short, a planned 17 hour, 1 stop journey became a 30 hour, 2 stop journey. I contacted Emirates and asked why we had not been placed on the direct flight from Dubai to Manila that evening. We would have still been late, but at least we would not have had to connect in Hong Kong. As yet, no answer. In fact, the response from Emirates has been condescending and wholly unsatisfactory. The Dubai ground crew and the Emirates customer service office give the impression that they are doing the delayed passengers a huge favour by shipping them out on a little bus to a Dubai hotel for a few hours and then placing them on later, non-direct flights. The customer services rep in his email to me even had the brass neck to point out how expensive it is for Emirates to re-book us on to another airline at Hong Kong. Here's an idea Emirates, stop re-scheduling passengers on to flights with almost impossible connection times and get your passengers to their destinations as advertised. In conclusion, we missed a late evening meet up with friends in Manila and I had to fork out Â£160 for new internal flights to our final destination, as we had missed our original flights in Manila. Any potential Emirates passengers out there, read these reviews and take heed. Avoid the headaches and book with an airline who actually know what they are doing. I certainly shall in future.",Detractor
" We booked a connecting flight from London to Dar es Salaam via Dubai. Due to bad weather in Europe our plane was late departing and we spent over two hours on the runway. Consequently we missed our connecting flight in Dubai. When we finally reached Dubai there was complete chaos. There were 200+ other people who also missed connections and it was not clear where to go. We followed the crowd to the desk area for help there were only 4 Emirates staff helping over 200 people get to their final destinations. We were trying to get to Dar Es Salaam in Tanzania to meet a further connecting flight to start a 5 night safari. After after about a 45 minute wait we eventually got to speak to someone who said we could get an 8 hour flight to Johannesburg then a further flight to back to Dar Es Salaam. This would mean we would have got to Dar Es Salaam too late to catch our final connection and would have missed two days of our safari. Out of a 5 night safari this is a significant portion. When I complained I was told to stop wasting his time. Other people were also being badly treated. One other passenger found a replacement flight online and asked to be transferred but was told you've got your ticket don't speak to me anymore. Bearing in mind Emirates knew early on that the plane would be delayed they had over 8 hours to sort this out what they came up with was completely inadequate. It seemed everyone was being sent to Johannesburg. As the flight to Johannesburg was 4am the next morning we were sent to a hotel to wait. When we got to the hotel there were hundreds of other people waiting to check in as well. We queued in reception for over 3 hours to get our room but I'm not sure why we bothered as we had no luggage as this was still at the airport. Thankfully our tour operator Audley Travel managed to book us onto a flight to Zanzibar and then onto Dar Es Salaam in time to meet our final connection and only miss 1 day of our holiday and not 2. The flight to Zanzibar was with FlyDubai which is owned by the same people as Emirates. Why couldn't we have been offered this option by Emirates? You would hope this was the end of our bad experience with Emirates but no. When we went to come home we turned up at the airport in Dar Es Salaam over 3 hours before our flight was due to leave but were told by the check in staff that they could not print our boarding passes. The reason for this is because our tickets were out of sequence. It seems you have have to go wherever Emirates wish to send you in this case Johannesburg regardless of wether you wish to go there or not. We spent a further three hours at the airport in Dar Es Salaam not knowing if we would be able to go home. They said it was a security issue but they could clearly see our passports, they could see when we arrived in Tanzania as our visa was stamped with the date of arrival and they would have known our luggage had been transferred to a different flight. Only thanks to the persistence of the check in manager at Dar Es Salaam who spent over 2 hours on the phone and the immigration officials who sped us through security did we make the flight back home with only 2 minutes to spare. All in all I would definitely not recommend Emirates as an airline. It seems they can only run an airline if things run smoothly but are completely out of there depth if they hit a problem. The mark if a good company is how they deal with things when problems arise and in my view they completely failed",Detractor
" Durban to Athens via Dubai. Emirates standards have dropped considerably. They don't even have the food which they are offering on the menu, the menu offers a choice but when you choose the fish they say they don't have. On this particular flight they even admitted they had hardly any of the fish option. On the next flight my wife was lucky enough to score the last chicken meal and I was forced to accept the beef. Also, the food was generally bland and I would hazard a guess they have changed caterers. They have also cut a few corners in the meal, for example the little chocolate has disappeared. They also didn't offer the usual overnight packs (tooth brush, eye thingy etc)...when I enquired about this I was told they only offer these on flights exceeding 9 hours and the first leg of our flight was about 8 hours. This must be a new policy, as we have always received these packs. I have for many years regarded Emirates as the worlds best airline, but after experiencing these cost cutting measures, I will gladly forfeit my skywards miles and go back to Qatar or Etihad.",Passive

 Los Angeles to Mumbai via Dubai. Food service on flight from Los Angeles to Dubai and return was one meal in second hour of flight and one pizza slice 2 hours before landing. This is what we were served on a 16 hour flight - they served soft drinks/juice and wine and alcohol 45 minutes after the first meal was served. Alcohol/wine is generally served 30 minutes prior to food service. The Dubai terminal was resembling a fish market. There were approx 120 seats near the gate. They are using A380-800 which is 475 to 500 passengers on a flight. The number of seats were totally inadequate. The staff serves food and drinks - but when you ask for something they dont have like Diet Coke/Diet Pepsi they say 'sir I have apple juice/orange juice' - They want passenger to believe they do not have Diet coke/diet pepsi. They are not willing to walk a bit and get the diet coke from the pantry for the passenger. Movies/TV shows were in large quantity but lacked quality. The staff do not clean the toilets on a 16 hour flight. This is not a premium airline - this resembles a budget airline.,Detractor

" Barcelona to Melbourne via Dubai. At the recommendation of the cruise company we booked with, who said they receive a very good deal with Emirates we had them book our flights. Prior to leaving we phoned Emirates to arrange seat allocations, after this was done we were informed that we were to be charged an extra $200AUD for this booking. After complaining to the cruise company they did pay this cost. This is the first time we have ever had to pay for booking seat allocations on any airline we have travelled on overseas. As my wife has a medical condition that prevents her from eating anything spicy we checked out the food options with Emirates and their representative was very understanding and recommended that the best option was a Western Vegan Meal, this was confirmed in a email from them. On the flight to Dubai/ Rome WHAT happens, my wife's meal arrives and if not the sauces then whether the fish,chicken,beef or pork all come out with curry in it. Regardless of complaints no other option available, no spare standard meal either. However, on the Dubai to Rome section when the same meal problem arose the cabin crew supervisor asked us for our flight details and said she would arrange to cancel this ""vegan"" meal option and it would mean my wife would have the choice of the regular meals on our return flights home from Barcelona. Somewhere in cyberspace this arrangement still lingers, for on our flight from Barcelona history repeated itself. Once again, No spare meals available so as before my wife had a whatever I could give her off mine, likewise the same issue came up on the flight from Dubai to Melbourne. Just to add insult to injury, as we were seated near the galley we saw meal trays dropped on the floor and the noise coming from there was loud to say the least, also we feel the toilets could have been more regularly checked as the basins needed cleaning and toilet rolls replaced as well as refuse bins emptied. Seated next to me was a young man with a liking for gin and tonics, He was seen ordering ""doubles "" e.g. two bottles at a time and also helping himself to the bar which was parked behind our seats. Added to this he decided it was more comfortable to squat on the seat with his posterior almost on the headrest of the seat. Of course what happened next was predictable, a full drink spilled all over me, so with using our blankets to clean up this mess and dry me off we needed two clean blankets. Request for same met with the reply that no spare blankets available, which meant we spent the rest of the flight cold no thanks to the air-con. However, just before arrival a flight attendant was seen collecting unused blankets and passed us with a large bag three quarters full of unused blankets, two of which I am sure could have been found with a little effort so we didn't go cold.

Unfortunately, on my sons flying date they needed more info (which they never informed me about) and tried to call me but never reached me and just didn't board my son. The next day I complained about this treatment and was forced to pay another 500$ to no fault of mine. They said I could get the money back through customer service. I did complain and stated my case but I only received an unfriendly rejection. Therefore this ticket cost me 2300$ which is higher than any other airline. In addition, my sons next day flight got delayed so that he missed the connection in Dubai due to Emirates fault. He had to spend the night at the airport to finally arrive another day later!

" I can't describe how upset I am by being stuck on Fl Dubai plane for 5 hours with no food, drink, in-flight entertainment or internet. I did book Moscow to Hanoi via Dubai specifically to fly with Emirates, that cost me 650USD one way, compared to Aeroflot 650USD/round trip which is direct, modern and safe anyway. I paid twice as much just to have an experience with Emirates. Instead of Emirates plane I found myself in an outdated shabby unsafe little aircraft. I never been send to a low-cost instead of a full service. How is that even possible a company like Emirates co-shares with a lower cost. By co-sharing I mean they stuck me on a lower cost, send one meal, 1 cup of free water and let me carry 30kg of luggage. There was no choice of food and the suggested free dinner, only one option, was not suitable for me, no free snacks available no nothing. I had to buy water and peanuts. I booked a ticket with Emirates for my husband London-Dubai-Hanoi round trip and he had an amazing flight despite his flight was longer and the price was cheaper. I don't book planes which sell water and sandwiches and I would never in a conscious mind choose Fly Dubai for a 5 hours flight, seats were uncomfortable even for my 5 feet. It was freezing cold the entire time and no blankets available, I couldn't even hear the announcement it was just cracking noise. The whole experience felt like a charter flight in 90s, I never saw flight attendants just sleeping on the back row on a 5 hours flight before, our departure was also delayed because of late arrival. I couldn't even charge my phone up to 60% in 5 hours, the equipment was that old! I have noticed that my flight is operated by FlyDubai on behalf of Emirates on my ticket but I have no idea what FlyDubai is and didn't expect such a con being pulled off by Emirates. FlyDubai is not the same level as Emirates, if I wanted to fly with FlyDubai, in my case Emirates is a middle-man profiting by using the brand to sell cheap flights at high price. I complained to the customer service afterwards but they just blamed me on not researching what FlyDubai is. So I guess they are aware of what they are doing but hope that people will be just tricked and book a ticket because of Emirates brand on it. Second flight Dubai-Hanoi was also pretty awful, just got a sandwich, croissant and an omelette in 7 hours flight, was pretty uneatable, the plane was very shabby as well. And at the check-in Emirates even tried to put me on standby because the plane was overbooked, even though I paid for my tickets 2 months in advance. guess Emirates don't care about their customers as much as they did.",Detractor
 Auckland to Birmingham via Brisbane / Dubai. The B777 on the Brisbane to Dubai leg was cramped and dirty. The A380 on the Dubai-Birmingham leg had more leg room. It was A380s on the return journey to Melbourne. Having heard people rate Emirates I was so disappointed. Each flight was late (by about an hour each time) departing. The cabin service was poor. We were offered one alcoholic drink for the whole of a 14 hour flight. The food was so salty as to be inedible and being on a special diet for medical reasons I couldn't eat anything that the airports offered. If the baggage locker over your seat row was full you had to find space somewhere else which could be several rows back. The cabin crew refused to help. So no I never want to use this airline again.

" Santiago to Sao Paulo. After my original flight from Latam being cancelled last minute (without an explanation from either branch in both countries until the next day after the flight would have left, I was forced to book a last minute (6 days in advance) cheapest flight I could find out of the country. I came across Emirates and booked a direct, roundtrip flight from Santiago to Sao Paulo for over $800. When arriving at my gate and waiting for my flight, my flight information was not up on the screen when it was supposed to be boarding. It said the UAE flight with whatever number (which, i guess in their defense was the same number as my EK flight) heading to Dubai was posted. confused, I looked at the screen of all the departing flights and mine was not mentioned. Remember, I was going to Sao Paulo, Brazil, not Dubai, UAE. I went up the workers at the Dubai counter asking them if they knew where my flight got cancelled since it would have been the same company. They said that was the same flight. The screen only said Dubai and had a different flight code. I never would have known that was my flight. We asked the workers several times to clarify that we were going to be getting off in Brazil since if they were wrong we would end up on the other side of the world. They confirmed again. I will compliment them on their politeness and calmness as I was definitely not very calm with them. Nowhere on the website, the check in online, my ticket, with the bag drop employee, or anywhere /one was it mentioned that the final destination was Dubai and Sao Paulo was just a stop over. Of course, when we were about the depart they were having brake issues for an hour, as well. Everything worked out in the end thankfully and they did serve a generous amount of food. But I would suggest posting (or at least notifying) passengers at least once of both / all destinations. I question now whether my flight was so expensive because of the additional destination that flight had and I feel slightly cheated.

" Flew Birmingham to Dubai. All Emirates flights have been full these days, but good for them for maximising profit. They handle a full flight quite well but expect to be sat in a centre seat if you are not very organised. But today they announced the flight was 'boarding' a full 45 minutes before it started boarding. This seems a bit dishonest? To be expected I guess but still lying.",Detractor
" Perth to Athens. Amazing service from start to finish and definitely not to be missed. Everything about the flight was wonderful, the quality of the food and drinks, the comfort of the seats, the amenities, the in flight entertainment system and wifi accessibility. However it was the intuitive service from the fabulous Emirates staff which stood out, alongside the onboard shower. Thank you Emirates for a memorable flight",Promoter
" Washington to Bangalore via Dubai. On all my flights, I am able to mention during booking the kind of food i would like on my flight. While booking my flight to go home, I couldn't do it on this occasion. Note that this was my first time on Emirates. I checked the website and all it gave was the menu and nothing else. Apparently, I should have given them a call and told them what I wanted for a meal but it didn't say so anywhere. It turns out that I was given fish to eat which i did, not knowing what it was. And when i raised a complaint with Emirates a couple months later, they blamed me saying I should have called them to say so. Nowhere was the instruction given that I need to do that. How am I supposed to know? During the flight, when I got a second meal, that's when I asked and they changed my meal, not even apologizing for the mistake they made. I only got to know after I got home that I had fish for lunch! Disgusting.",Detractor

" Rome to Dubai. An excellent flight on Emirates. Boarding at FCO on the A380 now faster, smoother thanks to the new departure gate at FCO with dual level air stairs. Nice welcome on board by smiling, professional crew. Took off 30 mins late due to late arrival of the inbound aircraft (due, no doubt, to delays at DXB during the morning departure rush between 07.30 - 10.00) but time was made up and we later landed on schedule. Someone says on earlier report that EK doesn't ask for feedback? There's a digital survey card contained within ICE or you can report your comments to one of the cabin supervisors. I did this as I wanted to comment on the fact that EK no longer offers a pre-lunch drinks service on this route instead combining the meal and cocktail service together. I understand why this is - some people want to eat as soon as they sit down - but it does make the initial part of the cabin service rather rushed, which is unnecessary on a 5.5 hour flight. In the past on this route ice cream was served about 4 hours into the flight but this has now been replaced with a sandwich and tea / coffee. Lunch, incidentally, was excellent (braised beef, gratin potatoes and the most delicious crumble for dessert), and I write that as someone who doesn't usually take the meal on this sector. Being extra picky here but it's a shame Campari is no longer offered as a cocktail in economy but good to note there was a selection of three different types of red wine. Everyone knows the ICE entertainment system is absolutely superb and caters for all nationalities / languages, I often watch Italian or French movies. This time, it even included live World Cup football. And the economy seats on EK's A380s are so comfortable and spacious. All-in-all another excellent flight on Emirates, an airline we've been flying regularly since they only had two or three planes!",Promoter
" Hong Kong to Zagreb via Dubai. I am quite disappointed with the general experience with Emirates. The taste catering is bad and the sandwiches are too dry to eat. The seat is of average space, but your space will be highly deprived when the front seat reclined. The TV appears to be too bright and it hurts the eyes. I could not watch the flight information on some of the flights. The thing that I am most furious is about the online system of Emirates. The website lags and you have very few choice in online check in as all passengers are pre-allocated a seat before check in. Finally, transit in Dubai Airport is a disaster that you could hardly find a way and it seems to be messy. Fortunately, cabin crew speak fluent English and they are international.",Passive
"  The booked flight was Gatwick to Wellington via Dubai and Auckland. The flight to Dubai was delayed by fog at Dubai, not Emirates fault, but no one to help us get to the right gate for the onward flight. Got on plane in time but it sat there for another 2 hours. Big rush to get from AKL intl. to domestic terminal but ongoing flight delayed for over 5 hours, no plane! The return journey was delayed at AKL by 6 hours due to tropical storm so missed connection to Gatwickat Dubai. Re routed to LHr via Rome. I have been trying to get compensation from Emirates ever since. Found out today that my airmiles for the return journey had not been credited to me either. Plane, crew, food and service is great, but their customer service is absolute rubbish, will never fly with them again.",Detractor
"  London to Adelaide via Dubai / Brisbane. I am very surprised that huge airlines like Emirates do not ask you to review them after your flight. Do they not want to know about problems or have feedback? Obviously not. I heard it was rated best airline but by whom? I have travelled with them and other large airlines but not been asked to vote for them good or bad. Well I review them as bad. It is not made clear during booking how much seat allocation is going to cost you until after you have paid for your flight (apparently hidden somewhere in the smallprint) You should have the opportunity DURING the booking process to add your chosen seats then you would not have to add them on extra later. I paid Â£180 for return flight for me and my child to sit together. That was just allocating the two cheapest seats together. The flights were Â£1500+. They told me I could book 2 seats together within 48 hours of flying for free if there were any left - thats if. The airport terminal in Dubai is enormous and we only just made it to the gate for the next leg on time. They need longer on the ground before next flight. Myself and my son, the people to my side that I could see clearly did not eat the food apart from scones. The green sausages looked like plasticine. The white sausages again looked and tasted of plasticine. It states clearly on the website all children travelling will be allocated child meals automatically 24 hours before travel. They do not. If I wanted my child to have child meals I had to personally phone on all 4 legs of the journey to book each one. It is not available to do this online, but meals like kosher and vegetarian are! Ridiculous. And when we boarded, after an hour of take off my son was really thirsty so pressed the bell for water - it took over 40 minutes for him to be attended and the people behind me kept pressing too but nobody came to them either. I will not choose to fly Emirates again, over priced and over rated. I've been with Malaysian Airlines and Qantas before and will go back to them next time as I never encountered one problem with either airline.",Detractor
" Flew from Dubai to Seattle, and JFK back to Dubai. First on Boeing 777 to Seattle full flight yet comfortable. I managed to have some good sleep, food was good quality, served breakfast and pizza and lunch. Crew were friendly and very helpful and flight was smooth. Return was from JFK to Dubai another 13 hrs on A380, the space in economy is huge and comfortable lucky enough the only empty seat was the one next to me so had the space to stretch and sleep, food was very tasty and again crew were very friendly and nice. Once we arrived in Dubai since I'm a resident I was at the luggage belt in less than 5 mins and in 20 mins I was in the taxi on my way home.

" Larnaca to Singapore via Dubai. Our flight from Cyprus got delayed more than an hour so we missed our connecting flight from Dubai to Singapore. As all other airlines do we thought that a group of flight attendants wold escort us to the new gate to catch the next flight, we also informed the flight attendants in our flight from Cyprus to Dubai to do so and they ensured us that this was going to be done and nothing to worry about. We needed to reach Singapore the following morning as we had a very important meeting arranged at the airport. However coming out the aisle none called our names and none would answer our questions on how to reach the next gate. They would only tell us that we missed the next flight as well and that there is no chance of us arriving on time to the gate to get the next one. After a lot of drama with the useless connection manager we lost a lot of valuable time with result of missing the next flight as well. It was simply horrible. Never experienced worse service in my life, not even with a budget airline. After arranging to stay in Dubai in order to have our meeting online we realized that we got an email from the airline that they rescheduled our seats for the following flight, and we could have made it on time if we saw the email earlier and not listed to the negative outcome from the unhelpful ''manager''. This is the second time this happened to my husband with this airline and we want to tell the travelers out there not to waste their valuable time and money well earned to throw it to them. Any other airline is much better!",Detractor

Inflight entertainment system was unreliable and difficult to operate, despite multiple screens. Food was terrible and surprisingly scarce.

I had a hard time getting a drink then was offered bourbon when I had ordered scotch. I didn't drink it and after many hours they took it away. Much later in flight, male flight attendant argued with me that the drink had been scotch not bourbon.

" Melbourne to Venice via Dubai. I have been flying Emirates for many years and always praised and recommend it. Not this time. And I am very angry and disappointed. I was wheelchair bound and when I arrived at the check in at Melbourne all seemed fine... until I have been taken 3 hours before my flight to the gate, gate 11 empty, alone and abandoned there. No water no one to ask for help no chance to go to a toilet as I needed assistance. When finally an attendant arrived to open the gate, I asked her if I could have a glass of water and needed a toilet she said there was none around and I had to go to another area. I was boarded and kindly a flight attendant on the plane helped me to the toilet and gave me a glass of water. She felt terrible for what I experienced but could not do much about it. She tried to make a sort of a stool with a bag to make me stretch my leg. When arrived in Dubai they told me I had to go to the service desk and tell them what happened. The guy in Dubai who took me on my wheelchair, instead, left me for a while â€œparkedâ€ while he was happily chatting with other friends until I waved to get his attention and asked again to be taken to the service desk. Finally at service desk I explained the situation and what I had endured in Melbourne. They said they would take me to the lounge to wait. The guy brought me to another plane where I was left, and almost missed my flight to Venice! When I received an alert from Emirates to go straight to the gate I tried to get attention again!!)! Arrived at the gate they changed my seat. Previously I had a seat with empty ones right and left to allow me to raise my leg and stretch it on other and I thought the change was similar. Instead they moved me to seats whose armrest was fixed and could not be lifted making it impossible for my leg to rest flat on the other seats.",Detractor
" Venice to Melbourne via Dubai. I am now on my way back to Australia and yet again experiencing the worst customer service ever from Emirates. Just before my departure I had received an offer to upgrade from economy to business for part of my return trip from Dubai to Melbourne for AU$ 1157 . As my leg had not yet healed ( did my way into Europe on a wheelchair) and although feeling much better, I thought I could do this effort and upgrade so that I could be more comfortable. Before my departure I tried several times to do the online upgrade but unsuccessfully, as every time i filled everything and clicked â€œupgradeâ€ a message came out that â€œthe system was downâ€! (Note that my card was more than capable of covering the cost hence it was not a payment issue ) Tried again before I had to catch my first flight but then I had to board and had to let go. Arrived in Dubai I went to the service desk where there was only single person available to do the ticketing service and was stuck serving a person for over 20 minutes! I had another person before me and I knew I would never had time to wait so I went to another side of the service desk to ask for assistance. The lady said no one else could assist and also that she knew for sure I could not upgrade with that offer anymore as I had already started the first leg. When I explained that I did try many times to do the upgrade online before my flight but the Emirates website did not work and a message came out that the system was down (so it was not my fault) they just said they could not do anything and if I wanted to upgrade the price would not have been the same! On the plane I asked again. They had quite a few empty seats in business but they asked almost 4 times as much as the offer I had in my email (asked around 3.500 US dollars for one leg upgrade on the plane! While my offer was 1157 Australian dollars for the same which equals to us$ 864) I am so angry and disappointed but, if you want to see this from a marketing point of view Emirates has lost both in image and in money. In fact those seats have remained empty and Emirates has now another very upset and angry customer who has been loyal for years. Emirates has gone so downhill lately which is unbelievable.",Detractor
" Cape Town to Melbourne via Dubai. Check-in and boarding in Cape Town were smooth. The flight to Dubai on a B777 was pleasant, with a comfortable seat which had adequate storage, and excellent food. The service was efficient but rather formal. The IFE on this flight was quite clunky. At Dubai we were bussed to the terminal, but as there was a dedicated Business Class bus this process was quite painless. Both the terminal itself and the Emirates lounge were very busy just after midnight. The second flight on an A380 was a big step up in luxury, with a more spacious seat, much more storage, more friendly cabin crew and very smooth IFE. Something went wrong with my vegetarian meal order, but it was cheerfully fixed. All in all a good experience.",Promoter
"  Brussels to Tokyo via Dubai. Plenty of flights with Emirates the last few weeks with several round trips to Sydney, Brisbane and Tokyo. Being a Platinum member, Emirates upgrade me from Business to First every 4-5 flights. I rate Business class on the A380 above Business on the 77W, but also better than First. The seat in First remains awkward. To me, Emirates are outstanding for route network, lounges services and catering, website booking/managing, chauffeur pickup, seat comfort, onboard wifi, crews, and of course their unique ICE inflight entertainment. Where Emirates do not get their act together however, is for inflight catering, which remains surprisingly awful also in First. I always eat at the airport before my flight. Not sure why this is so difficult as Qatar, Cathay and Singapore Airlines do succeed in providing their premium passengers with great food.",Promoter

I have flown Emirates to USA last year and to Toronto this year and was really happy,but this time on my way back from San Francisco, the crew were very lethargic.

This time they started service after 45 min of seat belt sign going off, slow and gloomy faces and No drinks. They said they have no time, they offered only wine.

My luggage was weighed by Emirates staff (One cabin bag and a laptop bag) and I was passed through. At next stage a female staff informed that I couldn't carry my cabin luggage as there is not much space inside the flight and I will need to Check-it in. I requested to carry it inside and explained it had original property documents which were very important and I couldn't check it in (I even opened my bag and showed her that there were only the documents). While I was talking to her the Supervisor came to me, grabbed my luggage in very rude manner and took luggage back to weighing place and told I am not allowed to take a laptop bag. I explained that it is mentioned on my tickets that one carry-on item such as laptop is allowed. He said your other bag is heavier than allowed limit and I will need to pay the money for that. I told it was already passed from Washington Airport as well as here (Dubai) also. It looked like that other staff there was also not comfortable with his behavior. Finally I requested him to let me go and I will pay the additional charge.

As a result we showed up on time of our original flight only to find out that Emirates moved us to an earlier flight without notifying us. Emirates refused to sit us on another flight and we had to buy new tickets back home all the way from Jakarta to Moscow.

We got our bag finally after 3 days of minimal communication from Emirates, only to find out our laptop got stolen along with other food items.

Furthermore, despite paying quite a substantial amount for the exit row seats to ensure we had extra legroom, on the Dubai to Lisbon leg, the space we paid for was constantly filled by passengers queuing up to have their photographs taken with Emirates service staff.

" Manchester to Durban via Dubai. I upgraded with miles to business class on both legs and qualified for the chauffeur drive at both ends. Business class is something Emirates does extremely well and the A380 business class product in particular is outstanding. B777-300ER still good but a 2-3-2 layour (instead of the 1-2-1 on the A380), seats don't lie 180 degrees flat and no personal work space/minibar. Attention from cabin staff, food etc great.

" Amsterdam to Melbourne via Dubai with Emirates in May 2018. It was genuinely a disappointing trip and confirmed just how overrated Emirates is. On the AMS-DXB sector, every Cabin Crew member genuinely looked like they did not want to be there. People would move out of their way in the aisle to make way for the crew and were never given a single smile or ""thank you"" of acknowledgement. They were far from friendly, could not crack a smile, and appeared like emotionless robots. The seats were so uncomfortable and you could feel the framework of them beneath your behind because the seats had been sat in so many thousands of times without re-upholstering. That's not very comfortable for a 14 hour flight. The entertainment system was a joke. Please don't get me started on it. On not one, but both sectors, there was no recognition in their system that I had requested a vegetarian meal, so I was lucky to be graced with ""untouched leftover"" vegetarian meals on both sectors, but only for one meal on each flight. The Cabin Crew on the first flight couldn't stop reminding me how lucky I was and that it was my fault and patronised me, repeatedly saying ""mmm yes, just next time you must request your meal beforehand."" They seemed to have not listened to a word I said. Regardless, there was not even a vegetarian option on the actual menu.",Detractor
" This was my first experience with Emirates, and I was surprised how average it was. Maybe expectations were too high, but this experience was just not as good as Emirates promotes itself (best airline? Really?) The aircraft was not new and a few seats were damaged. The cabin was not clean. The staff were not friendly, and once they totally ignored my request for assistance. Entertainment system was not very handy: the touchscreen was not working properly on both flights, so I had to use an old and an uncomfortable joystick. I didn't like the selection of movies, either - there were many movies in the database (including Asian, Bollywood etc) but all of the Western movies were more or less of the same genre. Same with TV shows. The dinner was very good, however, only one real meal on a long haul flight was not sufficient (only an old sandwich was given before landing).

 Dallas to Dhaka via Dubai. Nightmare in the Sky! Horrible Experience! The flight from USA to Dubai was a chaos! They have messed up the seating arrangement for most of the passengers. They changed my assigned seat. It was an aisle seat but they changed it to a middle seat. And again changed it back as I complained after boarding the aircraft. The interior of the aircraft looked old and not clean. The worst part was food. Chicken/prawn curry with rice. These were my options and I choose chicken curry. Snack was a small pizza which was a joke. I was hungry for the whole duration of the flight. The ticket was expensive so it was surely not a value for money.

" Hong Kong to Bangkok. Departure delayed by an hour due to a technical fault which could not be fixed with another Emirates A380 due to fly HKG non-stop to DXB three hours 25 minutes earlier. Some passengers from that flight were transferred to ours. But why that should have resulted in a lengthy delay to our flight beats me and was never explained. As a result we had to sit on board for over an hour before push-back. Once again I found the revised upper deck layout with 100 or so Y passengers in front of business class especially annoying, this time with what seemed like a major raucous party taking place just a few rows in front of my seat. Having travelled for much of the day and connected in HKG, I found it impossible to relax, the more so as the plane was being refuelled and the lighting full on. How come refuelling took place after the scheduled departure time given that our aircraft had arrived in HKG several hours earlier? Although hungry, I skipped dinner as midnight was just too late for me. All I wanted was try and sleep but even that was difficult with the short flight time. I appreciate that technical issues do occur and I felt sorry for those who had to be involuntarily rerouted via BKK and would as a result arrive late in DXB by six hours or more. For those of us who had elected to take the Bangkok flight, though, this was maddening! The lack of detailed explanations was even more so.",Passive
" Munich to Jakarta via Dubai. The quality and service with Emirates has gone downhill within years. Upon arrival in Munich, I am informed that one of the seats in the A380 is damaged and been told to change the seat. In addition to that, customer ignored the seating requested. The seat is damaged was located in the window seat and only middle seat available, because it is a full flight. Never experience like this before on other airline. The first food was edible and the second one (before landing) was awful. The entertainment on my seat was broken, asking staff for help but ignored this helped. The WI-FI is free for several minutes but you must pay again after that. Last leg on DXB-CGK this is at least better than the MUC-DXB route which everything works fine. The service on the A380 was unacceptable with lack of customer support who decides on changing seat for the customers that flies the A380. In the future, I will avoid their A380 because of this issues with IFE etc. I have sent complaint to the airline which I'm still waiting for any replies about this experience.",Detractor

Crew were very nice telling passengers sat in full rows that there were free rows scattered around the plane that they could move to. Plane was brand new, great seats, great entertainment system.

Got to the terminal and realised I left my onwards boarding pass on the plane but the staff issued me a new one very quickly. Second flight boarded on time as well however, we were an hour late taking off due to the weather but the crew made up for it.

" I had prepurchased a seat for extra legroom, but the layout didnt state that the seat is next to the staff kitchen/pantry. And because of this, I receive constant noises and laughter from the staff, even when the public lights are off, waking me up at several times. That's not all, I had paid for extra legroom, but people are constantly knocking my long stretch legs over, causing me to retract my legs all the time. Hence, the irony of purchasing an extra legroom when in fact, I don't get any throughout the flight. To make things worst, there are 2 staff seats opposite our seats, so during landing and take off, 2 staff will be sitting there. And because they are sitting there, I have to retract my legs again. I'd paid for extra legroom, but in the end, it was a terrible experience. Never again am I going to prepurchase a legroom at the sides of the plane, especially from Emirates. Terrible experience. As for the other experiences, most of the crew were ok, they will serve and do their job, but lack the smile on their face. Not that they look rude or unhappy, it's just not the expression you will receive in flights like Singapore Air. Inflight entertainment was good, great contents, but the touchscreen was terrible. Touchscreen is based on a mouse cursor on screen. If you touch a particular button, you need to do it a few times so that the cursor will understand that it should be at your thumb.

 Auckland to London via Dubai. First time to fly on Emirates and was expecting excellent service for a big airline fleet. I was disappointed. The flight attendants seemed unhappy and unenthusiastic with what they are doing. They seemed robotic and lacked human compassion that I've experienced with other airlines.

" We flew from London to Manila via Dubai and back. Boarding wasn't stressful. Legroom was good and the seats had a good recline. It was enough for me to sleep when I needed to. However, I did get very numb towards the end of the flights. At 8-9 hours per leg, this wasn't unexpected. The quality of the food was good. I had the gluten free meal and my partner the normal. Both flavour, variety and good portion sizes. I didn't feel like the gluten free option meant I had substandard food, so I would take this into account if you have any intolerances. The entertainment was very good. We were spoilt for choice for films and TV shows, and the inflight status was a nice extra. The larger screens were on two of our flights, and were much more responsive than the smaller, older versions on our other two flights. For the smaller screens, we just used the physical controllers, but these were easy enough to use too. All of the staff were highly professional, prompt and courteous. We had a few smiles as well. All in all I'm very happy with my experience from Emirates. The flight weren't cheap at Â£580 return, but there were many cheaper options available. I'm glad we chose to pay the extra Â£100 for Emirates as the extra comfort went a long way for such a big journey.",Promoter

The Emirates driver picked us up spot on time and delivered us to Amsterdam airport where we quickly dropped our luggage. (We were already checked in using the Emirates app which is very user-friendly). Departure was on time and we were actually more often addressed in Dutch then when flying KLM! There was a large contingent Dutch-speaking flight attendants on board. Even the captain appeared to be Dutch and all announcements were made in Dutch, English and Arabic. Priority cards were given for immigration in Dubai which went quite fast especially considering the huge amount of flights arriving around midnight in Dubai.

My light was on for the entire beginning of the flight and no one attended until I called a flight attendant. There was one compartment was open for the beginning of the aircraft descending and we had to call them to make them aware of how dangerous it is. The bathroom was dirty and not even enough toilet Paper. No crisps no chocolates no peanuts but biscuits! Everybody doesn't want a roll if you just want to nibble and then you bring your own snacks when you already paid for a ticket and there is Not enough breakfast or lunch or Dinner of Choice. They serve disgusting food, I am a westerner not an Asian and they offer me noodles as not enough western breakfast?

" Dubai to New York JFK. The service was very good, the crew was efficient and responsive. The condition of the toilets was very, very poor. The number of passengers using the toilets warrants that someone clean the toilets, including the floor, at regular intervals during a 13 hour flight. It is not sufficient to clean only before and after a flight. I realize crew may not see this as within their job but there is something off kilter about handing out scented warm towels, booties and toothbrushes but expecting passengers to use filthy toilets.",Passive
" Bangkok to Istanbul via Dubai. I've used Emirates for connecting flights several times and decided never to use it again. I recommend everyone to avoid a connecting flight in Dubai with Emirates. The airport is huge and making a transfer in the airport requires a lot of time and patience. It is always very crowded and even finding somewhere to sit except restaurants or cafes sometimes impossible. There are always long queues for security checks. The terrible flight experience in my recent flight proved it: Emirates recommends to spare at least 1 hour for making transfer in Dubai. In my latest flight from Bangkok to Istanbul, the connection time was 1hour 15 minutes. The flight from Bangkok to Dubai delayed 45 minutes, which means that I will definitely miss my flight in Dubai to Istanbul. Despite this fact, ground staff in Bangkok reassured me that I would make the connection and there would be a ground staff at Dubai airport waiting to assist for the connection flight to Istanbul. When I arrived at Dubai airport 45 minutes delayed, the ground personal informed me that my seat to Istanbul was cancelled and handed me the voucher for a hotel and food. She told me that my flight would be tomorrow at 2.30 pm UAE time. With no further assistance she left. I had many more troubles in the latter times of my journey. The response I received from the customer service regarding my complaints were not satisfactory and disrespectful. My latter complaints were totally ignored. Other issues with this airline: Their seat layout 3-4-3 seat, which means the corridors are thin and the cabin is filled more passengers. It makes you feel claustrophobic. One annoying thing about their entertainment system is that you have to watch several commercials before the movies or any other videos. Yes it is cheaper compared to other airlines and maybe should be listed in budget airline category.",Detractor
" I used to brag about using Emirates but no more. Had two bad flights with them this time. Dirty tray tables, blocked toilet sinks, dirty toilets and two broken seats. Seat would not stay in one position, every time I moved the seat reclined. Interesting the cabin crew tell you seats must be in an upright position for takeoff, if it IS broken they don't care! Had two broken seats in two flights. Customer services don't care unless you are what they want (Business and First class). Not wasting any more money on them when you can get a budget flight at a fraction of the cost and the same service.",Detractor
" Birmingham to Cape Town via Dubai. Booked flight online for myself, partner and my 16 year old daughter only to be asked at check in for her birth certificate and a lawyers letter to enter South Africa. At no point during the flight booking did it flag up the fact these documents were required. The man on check in kept referring to the need for a visa to enter South Africa hence the requirement for paper work. You do not need a visa to enter South Africa. Surely the need for birth certificates etc should be flagged on entering each passengers DOB to prevent this happening. I contacted the South African immigration whilst the man continued to deny my daughter and told that they would have had no problem allowing my 16 year old daughter to enter. Still she was refused. The customer service manager did not even take the time to listen to us. He appeared to take great delight in shattering my daughters long awaited visit to South Africa. Well done Emirates.",Detractor
" Dubai to Bangkok. Emirates have an economy class seats on the upper deck of their A380. I got the chance to reserve the seat in advance. The upper cabin is spacious than the lower cabin with 2-4-2 layout. Add to that the side storage bins for those seating in the window seat. The flight was full because of the Songkran Festival in Thailand. Drinks and a small pack of biscuit was given right after take off. Lunch was serve almost two hours into the flight which i guess is a bit early for a 6 hour flight. Drinks and wet towel were provided before we land. The front lavatory on the upper deck are spacious. Unfortunately, those seating on the upper deck cannot go down the lower deck to roam and stretch their legs. Emirates' ICE is was superb. I got to enjoy the view from the plane's outside camera.",Promoter
 Hyderabad to New York via Dubai. Emirates standards have really dropped. Cons: Emirates b class lounge in terminal b in morning time is a joke. Food is consistently bad in these lounges and there is no a la carte. There is not a single chair to sit on. Horrible experience. Very noisy with spoons and plates clattering all the time. There are a ton of food options but all of them mass produced and on a hot dish. In flight experience also Emirates has no a la carte concept. Either you chose from that menu in those 3 hours or forget about it. No good soups or mild flavours they again gs for quantity over quality. During the entire time of 15 hours cabin crew is going by back and forth making sleep difficult. TheWorst part however is the fact that there is lounge in JFK. This is simple not acceptable. They give a 40 usd voucher which you can Use in any restaurant but almost all restaurants were closing. So I had a glass of wine and fries in McDonald's. This is unacceptable. Pros: flight attendants on all sectors were very nice and tried to make up for an old and tired airline.

" Sydney to Christchurch. Incompetence of Emirates check-in personnel that may cost me over $400 On April 8, 2018, my wife and I were travelling on EK412 from Sydney to Christchurch. We were carrying an expensive PC as a gift to our daughter for her graduation from the university that we purchased in Australia and we planned to claim tax refund. It's a common knowledge (and a common sense, too) that goods need to be produced to a tax refund officer to obtain tax refund. To our knowledge, at Sydney Airport tax refund office is located beyond check-in, immigration and security and I intended to bring the PC there. The box was pretty bulky, and I was told that I had to check it in. It was a natural question that I asked the check-in assistant â€“ how was I supposed to produce it to a tax refund officer if I do that. The junior assistant who was checking us in didn't know the answer and asked her supervisor by name David. David assured us that producing receipt to a tax refund officer was sufficient to claim tax and that goods don't need to be necessarily produced if they're checked in, so we checked the box in along with our luggage. At the tax refund office, the officer requested me to produce the goods besides the receipt, which I was unable to do. The officer then said that I had to produce it to a tax refund officer located before check-in point, of which the airline should have informed me. When I replied that the airline advised me that the good don't need to be produced to a tax refund officer and producing receipt alone is sufficient to claim tax refund, the officer still accepted my claim but it's now up to decision of the main office in Canberra, whether I will receive tax refund after not being able to produce the goods. Thus, the incompetence of Emirates check-in personnel in matters of tax refund may cost me over $400 if my claim is ultimately not entertained. What are you going to do about this, Emirates?",Detractor
" Melbourne to Kuala Lumpur via Singapore. Bought Emirates tickets but fly with Qantas and Jestar. Used to fly Emirates and the services was pretty good so we went back to Emirates. Both Qantas and Jestar was ok too but this whole codeshare thing had really ruin our family trip. Ticketing was not transferred properly from one airline to the other airline and we have had to scrumble to find our own way. When customer purchased a ticket from one airline their expectation is solely to that particular airline. Otherwise we could have chosen other airlines. Nearly missed our flight. Treated poorly at counter and was told it was ticketed by another airline so we didn't get to choose seats, food or nothing at all. Essentially a subclass customers. We did not know nor had chosen Qantas and Jestar. Not once heard of Emirates other than paying more and handed to other airline including a budget airline.

" Aircraft interior space including food and beverages were more than average. But the service by the ground and cabin crew were terrible and not acceptable. Unbelievably, they do not respond to the guests. They do not say a word other than ""commands"" to guests. They talk only when they have to instruct guests. I did not hear thank you, welcome, sorry, even when they forgot to distribute food and beverages to us. Not sure it is their culture or lack of company training, but, they looked quite rude to me. Furthermore, older aircrafts we flew with the seats were non reclining, with touch screens where cursors pointed at where I did not touch with a hard to select menu. Delta or other US airlines are much more friendly and polite.",Detractor

" This was an absolutely fantastic experience on Emirates first class from Dubai to Manchester on EK17 on April 8th. Its been a while since I last flew with Emirates. When compared with the likes of British Airways, Etihad and American Airlines, Emirates wins by a mile. Todays flight was excellent. The First class cabin was lovely, the onboard Spa was truly refreshing and spacious. I was well looked after by the head purser on this flight.

The chauffeur driven services in both destinations were excellent and extremely useful",Promoter
" Flew Hong Kong to Dubai. In general, the service of Emirates has been bad on my recent experience, that included check-in and in-flight. But what makes its service appalling is not just the no desire to help and no smile, it's the cabin crew's attitude of too proud to serve the customers. Honestly, I can withstand bad service from an airline, but an inappropriate attitude is something that prevents me from choosing Emirates again, as I don't think any customer deserves that.",Detractor

" Manchester to Cape Town via Dubai. We chose to experience Emirates based on their reputation, despite taking a longer route via DBX. Apart from the usual issues with the in flight entertainment screen, the flight was fine. Cabin temperature could have been slightly warmer for comfort. The second leg from Dubai to Cape Town on an older 777 was much less than perfect. On one of our seats the overhead light was not working and given this was a night flight needed. Whilst on the stand I reported this to a member of staff who told me that they could not move us to another seat as we were a couple. We had the usual issues with the in flight entertainment screens with random actions and scrolling cursors. The area we were seated in was extremely cold and my wife ended up using four of the airline blankets to try and be warm enough to get some sleep. I went for a walk around the economy area and found in all other areas the temperature was adequate. We appeared to be sat below an air con portal blowing cold air. This affected say ourselves and another dozen or so passengers who could be spotted by their huddled looks with coats and blankets. When I asked about this I was told that â€œComputer saysâ€ it's 25 degrees. In our zone it was probably about 12 degrees. The member of staff was dismissive. It would have been bad enough if they had agreed but apologised that nothing could be fixed in-flight. I decided to seek the supervisor. In regards to the heating they did accept there was a fault and that staff should have not tried to ignore the issue. On the matter of the overhead light they said that we could have been reseated in row 50 as there was space at take off. They agreed with comments about the issues and the poor customer service. They said they would take immediate verbal action with staff in flight and would file a report regarding my issues at base. They presented me with a business card without names on and an email address to write to. On arrival in Cape Town I sent a comprehensive report to the alleged customer service email on the business card. I received a curt rejection pointing me to the on-line complaints form. Emirates customer complaints response indicates that their target is to respond in 30 days. Having heard nothing before we were heard nothing before we were due to fly back home. On my return via Johannesburg, I asked to speak to the Emirates group side manager, to see if anything had been planned in response to our complaint. After a long period of time the manager informed me that it was with the UK Customer Relations unit and still under investigation. To date still no contact some 37 days later. On the return trip home my wife encountered a problem with a member of staff pointing her finger to get out of the way effectively, without saying a word. Another poor PR exercise was a steward reading a tablet and in the hearing of others selecting a passenger individually and indicating they were a frequent customer and if there is anything I can do for you my name is... My general feeling is that Emirates is resting on its historic reputation. Having flown Qatar Airways they are still maintaining customer services a better standard. In short not worth the effort of flying Emirates!",Detractor

" Emirates have become a low cost carrier. Flew Christchurch to Sydney on A380 in business class, EK413. Whilst this is a short flight I have paid a premium for business class, Emirates are now at a race to the bottom for service. The A380 business class is the new economy class. There are so many people to cater for staff can not handle it. No pre-dinner drink offered and had to ask twice for a drink. Staff were rude and unfriendly.

" Bangkok to Sydney. The boarding time was incredibly confusing with the boarding process slightly disorganised. We were greeted onboard with champagne before take off. Once airborne, the dinner service was incredibly drawn out from taking orders to serving the dishes and drinks. From what I can see most of the cabin crew looked tired and wanted the process to be over, with not many smiles going around only person stood out when she introduced herself. I managed to get 3-4 hours of sleep as the seat was quite comfortable but I can see the hard product is ageing. Breakfast was very unsatisfactory, basically fruit and bread which is nothing exciting for me to talk about. The IFE was amazing, with its many options I was entertained the whole flight. Overall, the experience was very average and not up to scratch and by far it's my least favoured experience with Emirates in a premium cabin.",Passive
" Gatwick to Bangkok via Dubai. The car arrived 15mins early on an icy morning, very nice driver who took a slightly longer but safer route to Gatwick. Orderly at check-in, swiftly through security and into the Emirates lounge. Breakfast with newspapers and excellent coffee. The lounge staff are always subtly cheerful. Uneventful flight through to Dubai. The ICE entertainment and Wifi excellent. Easy transit to the business lounge and boarding connecting flight is directly from the lounge. Slept most of the flight into Bangkok, but woken by cabin crew in time for breakfast. Arrived on time. Fast track voucher gets you through Bangkok Suvarnabhumi immigration very efficiently, very long queues outside the priority lanes. 15-20 min wait for baggage to arrive.

" Flew Amsterdam to Dubai. Emirates has some of the laziest cabin crew in the industry. The quality of their service has been tanking for years now and whereas small details used to set a new standard, most of these details are no longer offered. I have flown Emirates many times and somehow they never manage to leave on time - and rarely do they make up for lost time. This flight for example landed 40 minutes past schedule. When you leave later and spend more time on board, details start to matter. Like for example how long it takes before meals are served. But even as important as when the meal trays are collected. The first they try to stall for obvious reasons, they used to serve 2 meals on these flights and now 1 and some crackers. The later they serve it, the less obvious the difference. The second causes unnecessary annoyance. When you're in a window seat and have to wait for 1 hour and 40 minutes for them to clear the trays - and you have to use the toilet - you're going to start having doubts about their service. Their crew are more occupied getting to know each other and sharing party stories than being involved in the service they should offer. In the absence of alternatives like Qatar Airways, you're almost forced to fly Emirates to most of the Middle East, which is another annoyance. I am starting to give up hope the Emirates of the 2008-2013 era will ever return. They have become a very ordinary airline with nothing special to offer except a large screen (which I don't even use because I prefer to sleep).",Passive

" Dubai to Rome. I'm so disappointed. I have been flying with EK since 2002 and in the last 3 years i have seen a constant decline. It has now hit the bottom. Travelling to Rome has been a disaster from the start. At online check in, i could not find seats next to my 9 year old son. I couldn't book his seat without paying extra 50$ (my seat was free because of skywards) on top of the 900$ premium cost of the ticket itself (seriously this is what you claim in your radio ads favouring families). Called the call center. First time i was told there are no seats available (yet the app shows seats on rows 22, 23, 36 and 50). The second time I was told these seats are not eligible for children (seriously? bassinet seats not eligible?) and third time i was asked for 90$ to change my seats. Bottom line, no longer worth the premium paid. It used to be worth every cent extra, now even FlyDubai offers a better service (and you dont even pay for seats at check in!)

" Chicago to Chennai via Dubai. I really had a very bad experience with Emirates. I didn't know that number of bags reduced from 4 to 3 and the front desk people asked me to arrange bags and charged me 10lb extra weight fee of $50 and verified my cabin bag weight(8kg). After cleared the security, I bought some duty free stuffs from Chicago ORD airport and there is no question in Chicago airport boarding.After I reached Dubai when I board Chennai Airport Emirates staff asked me to weight cabin bag and duty free stuff and they said everything has to be placed in the cabin bag. They kicked out me out of the queue and asked me to arrange my luggage. I spent 10-15 minutes to arrange everything. After arranging every stuffs they said my cabin is overweight (includes duty free stuff). They suggested to reduce weight by throwing some stuff in trash or return duty free stuffs. Since the duty free stuffs I bought from US I couldn't able to return and they said I need to pay fee then only they can let me in. Staff behavior is totally not unacceptable, Emirates staffs are trying to steal money from customers my saying you have addition weight on your luggage. Staffs didn't say anything about the price detail and they charged me USD120 which more than the dutyfree stuff/10lb extra weight. Finally I saw my card was Charged $120 for $80 dollar stuff. This is my worst travel experience ever. If you have a policy then why are you allowing the duty free in ORD airport and not Dubai. If the duty free stopped in ORD airport I would have returned in ORD airport. Since the duty free stuffs are allowed in ORD I couldn't able to return in Dubai and I am force to pay. I am returning back to US today and restricted my baggage today to avoid any confusion but there is no cabin baggage verification or weight check happened today. Few of the economy passengers have both Cabin luggage and back pack and some of them have cabin luggage, back pack and Duty free from Dubai but no one was checking.

" Athens to Newark. On a scheduled 11 hour flight from Athens, not once except with meals were refreshments offered, including water, and beverages, etc. This was a flight during daylight hours so the cabin crew did not have a reason to not offer drinks. When a person requested a beverage it was obvious that the cabin crew was annoyed with the request, even though their ads on the inflight entertainment was stressing to stay hydrated during the flight. This was just the opposite of our experience on Singapore airline where the cabin crew came through about every 30 minutes offering drinks, sandwiches, fruit and candy bars including Toblerone candy bars.

Couple of things here, they decide to come and tell me that they are out when the flight is about the descent to the destination, and hostess who knew that I skipped Dinner does not bother to come and explain the same earlier. Regardless, I had lost my appetite by then - asked them to not bother, but they insisted to get a hindu meal(as that was the only thing available), but that turned out to be stale.

" Brussels to Chennai via Dubai. Major concerns regarding Emirates flight and ground staff support at Dubai. My mother was traveling Emirates from Brussels to Chennai with stopover in Dubai.

This wheelchair was once again confirmed prior to her flight. And again after her flight experience. Each time an Emirates representative told me that her wheelchair is booked all along each stop. However on 23rd February 2018, upon arrival in Dubai, she wasn't given a wheelchair, instead ground staff rudely told her she had to walk as they couldn't accommodate her a wheelchair. Did not expect this from Emirates. As a result my mother was helped by 3 other passengers who helped her reach her connecting flight. At this point I'm besides myself and have no words to express my fury over Emirates and its customer service. On her return flight on March 6, we had made multiple calls and emails requesting the highest level of wheelchair (apparently Emirates has levels of wheelchairs). Yes once again, she was denied a wheelchair at Dubai airport. Instead, Ground staff made her walk. Emirates have no customer service skills nor respect for their customers.",Detractor

" Due to weather conditions, my flight from Birmingham to Kolkata via Dubai got cancelled after 3 hours from check in at the airport. While other airlines were distributing food coupons after the delayed flights Emirates said they'll transfer us to hotel in their coach. We stood at the conveyor belt and collected my luggage which were distributed between two belts. We came out to find out that there is no coach, no hotel. Emirates made the promise while they were trying to arrange for hotels, they either don't know their verbs or plain lied. Their latest version was 'we are suggesting you go home and we will contact you when you are rescheduled'. A flight can get cancelled due to weather conditions but can a reputed brand act such foolishly and keep lie conveniently and put their valued customer in a vulnerable situation. While UK came to standstill I was dragging 50kg luggage in snow all by myself at 10pm in the night.",Detractor
" Hong Kong to Dubai. I was sitting in 42C (originally sitting on 42B but changed seats by someone else) on the aisle. The flight was really full that it was trying to get all travelers from Hong Kong and nearby cities to Dubai. The boarding gate was fair that I need to take the train to my boarding gate. Cabin crew were nice and ready to help us. The meal selection included either Chicken or Beef, which I chose the Chicken with pasta which I think the taste is fair, not really good at all. I had ordered their cup noodles as well but it was neither taste well . The ICE flight entertainment is really good, however the hardware was not so adapted into it. The plane was quite old and they use the setup which years ago does. I could understand with that but I think it's time to get some renovation on that plane, which they could change to the setup on their Boeing 777-300ER. After some time of sleep, the snack came with Beef sandwich with drinks. Even though the sandwich was dry, it tastes better than the dinner. Before the flight landed, some travelers attempted to change seat even though the belt sign was on for a while, the cabin crew had to yell to stop them but those travelers changed anyway. The flight arrive Dubai almost an hour earlier than expected. Hope next time I will have better experience on this flight.",Passive
 Flew from London Heathrow to Dhaka via Dubai. I have been flying with Emirates for a long long time and I love their service. Their A380 is fantastic but their 777 service on the Dubai to Dhaka flight did downgrade a little and they should improve on that so it is how they used to be on that route in the past. Their Dubai to London service has been amazing as always. Would recommend this airline.,Promoter
" Travelled from Birmingham to Kuala Lumpur via Dubai, with a 24 hrs stop in Dubai on return. Chauffeur came on time as arranged. Lovely chap. Got to BHX. Dropped off directly outside check in. First time at this airport and not impressed. Lounge is small with a selection of warm food. Struggled to get reception to use mobile. Seat 20A although business class felt claustrophobic. Food was nicely presented. Wasn't too keen on starter (the chicken mango confit) main Opted for duck which was lovely. No amenity bag given on day flight. Which is a shocker. Flight was full as such the bar area was packed. Arrived at DXB connecting flight in concourse B. Business lounge seem like a free for all where they allowed anyone in. Over crowded and not enough seating. Showers busy, dark and outdated. Flight to KL seats better. Night flight food was breakfast. Had the omelette which wasn't overly nice. Arrived on time. Had to get train to the baggage hall. 1st one to arrive. My flight companion bag came off 1st. However due to error by BHX not labelling my bag correctly with business tag it came off around an hour later with the economy passengers. As such missed my connection. Anyway return journey in business lounge in KL very small. Showers were a bit worn out and not clean. Food was barely warm and limited. Night flight and managed to get a few hours sleep. Breakfast served was same as on way in therefore wasn't too keen. Just had hot chocolate and cake. Arrived 4:30am. Had 24 hrs in Dubai. Freshened up in lounge then went into Dubai city. Final leg was departing from concourse A which was world apart from B. It was much cleaner. Less crowded and overall better. Showers nice and clean. Was offered slippers too. Food was more fresh. There was a nice white area with a lounge chair where I managed to get a few hours sleep before the flight. Boarded return to Manchester. Again night flight. Breakfast options so slept all way. Best sleep so far on the 4 sector of the journey. Maybe because I was tired. Service good, food fair Business lounge-concourse B poor, concourse A good. Value for money reasonable Overall reasonable, but Qatar business class considered better based on this experience.",Passive
" It looks like Emirates are picking up again. Fast check in in DÃ¼sseldorf and also in Manila. Like almost always cabin was nearly outbooked.

" The crew on Emirates are superb, staff that look like they love their jobs. It was the little touches that made a difference like taking a Polaroid of the kids for them to take as a souvenir, or wearing ""Happy New Year"" head gear as we were flying on New Years Eve. Seats had a lot of leg room. I was sat next to the window and didn't feel claustrophobi, probably as the plane's walls don't curve in so much on the lower deck and the windows are so large. Main problems were the IFE wasn't working properly - plus the system was trying to offer too much (i.e. loads of films) without much thought gone into the execution and ease of use of it. Other problem was the food. Really appalling! Was happy to go hungry instead.",Promoter
" Emirates is known for being bad but having to stand in a queue for 1.5 hours to board was a step too far during a Feb 18 flight Oslo - Dubai. It was the same for Business Class. Passengers were going crazy, understandable given the situation. I fly Emirates once a month and points system is also the worst globally. This is why I avoid Emirates wherever possible. I also messaged the Country Manager of Emirates for Norway and Iceland), he was aware of issues but not willing to do anything to make up for the farce.",Detractor
" We've had a pretty good experience. The lounge in Amsterdam Emirates shares with other airlines is nothing to write home about. The A380 is a marvellous machine, though the seat arrangement is not couple friendly if you want to sit next to a window. You can only sit together in the middle rows. The service and the food were as expected. The sky bar is a fantastic gimmick except if you want to sleep with your seat close to the bar. Choose a seat away from the bar if you want quiet. Our connecting flight departed from Terminal C which we did not particularly like. Lots of construction going on. The Emirates Lounge offers less amenities than the one in Terminal B. However, the food selection was excellent. The Dubai to Mumbai leg was a bit of a letdown. The plane looked rather old. The age of the airliner was particularly evident in the entertainment system. The screen resolution was that of the past decade, so underwhelming. The remote control still had a phone on one side which says it all. The service and the breakfast served were good however. After this experience we were worried that for the return leg to Dubai again and old 777-300ER would be used. Additionally, web check-in did not work and our hotel only reached their Mumbai office after trying all day. We did not know whether we would be seated together until we arrived at Mumbai airport. To our pleasent surprise we were seated together and the plane was much newer with excellent screens, the separate iPad and the remote control that looks like a Playstation portable. The range of Entertainment programs Emirates' ICE system offers is fabulous. We used the lounge in Terminal B which is superior to the one in Terminal C. An absolute highlight is the Moet and Chandon bar. Very friendly staff. The last leg from Dubai to Amsterdam was again an excellent experience with good food and friendly service. The limousine transfer worked well. However, the communcation skills of the limousine service center in Mumbai could be improved. Communcation was done with abbreviated text messages and rather informal, the way teenagers communicate.",Promoter
" Dublin to Dubai. Emirates is my favourite airline. Upon boarding the aircraft, I was greeted with smiles and welcomed. On the seat is a blanket and headphones.

The inflight dining is the best I have experienced with any airline. The process of connecting in Dubai was seamless with staff on hand to assist passengers.",Promoter
 I flew overnight Birmingham to Dubai then 1hour 30min stopver before flight to Melbourne. Upon arriving in Dubai I checked the board and saw Emirates flight to Melbourne leaving from gate x so I headed to gate x. Then I checked another board and it said gate z for Emirates flight to Melbourne. I figured that gate had changed and headed to gate z. When boarding was happening for Emirates flight to Melbourne at gate z they informed me I had missed my flight which left from gate x. They were very rude and said I had to go to the Emirates connections counter. They informed me that there were 2 Emirates flights to Melbourne leaving an hour apart and I had gone to the wrong gate. I also discovered that Dubai airport had a new policy (6 months) of no flight boarding announcements or for late passengers so they can have a nice quiet airport where passengers miss their flights. I said to the Emirates staff that they had a duty of care to inform me at check in that there was 2 flights leaving to Melbourne so I wouldn't miss my flight. Another Emirates staff admitted to me that passengers miss this flight to Melbourne every day because of this 2 flight situation. Emirates would not change my ticket as well as Qantas who sold the original ticket (Airline partnership situation) so I had to buy a new ticket for that leg Â£440. So in summary Emirates knew passengers miss this flight everyday because of the unusual situation of 2 Emirates Melbourne flights leaving Dubai each day within 1 hour yet they choose not the inform their passengers at check in of this situation so they can daily double charge their passengers. Shame on Emirates and Shame on Qantas for this avoidable unfortunate situation.,Detractor
" Bali to Amsterdam via Dubai. I travelled with Emirates Back and fourth to Bali during the Christmas holiday. My experience of the flight was ok, but my experience with the transport of baggage and the customer service was the worst I have ever experienced. I go on a surf trip 3-4 times a year and I always pack my board the same way with allot of bubble wrapper, towels, pillows and a good board bag and I have never had any problems. On the trip down when I unpacked my board I had a few cracks that I had to fix. I called Emirates, and a very rude customer service member said that someone would call me up, of course no one did. But lesson learned. On my way back I packed my board even more carefully and added a fragile sign on the bag. To my chock when I packed up my board on arrival in Amsterdam, it was completely destroyed and rendered it useless. I called Emirates who refuse to take this matter on the telephone but told me they wont cover anything but I could send them a mail. Which I did. In the email I pointed to according to the Montreal convention they are responsible for any damage they cause on the baggage. The response was very simple. ""we are sorry for the broken board but we can and wont do anything about it, and we will not answer any more enquiries regarding this matter"" I have emailed them many times after that but the refuse to answer. My friend travelling to Copenhagen also got his board destroyed and same horrible treatment by Emirates. That's why I write this review, I want to warn everybody to travel with Emirates! As long as you pay and shut up there is no problem but when they have caused a problem they wont do anything about it. If you Google similar matters you will see that I am not alone in being mistreated by emirates customer service. I will never travel with Emirates again. 0/10 points.",Detractor
" Flew Fort Lauderdale to Casablanca via Dubai. For the longest time, I had wanted to fly Emirates, I was curious by its ads claiming to be the best economy airline in the world. In fact, about 2 years ago, I had the chance to travel to Dubai and visit Emirates training centre, where we toured the facilities, it all looked very impressive and glamorously chic. I could not wait to experience all the glamour they so advertised. I get to the counter to check in and I was expecting luxury, beautiful people in Emirates fashion, just like advertised, reality was far off as clerks at counter were just plain Janes, no problem at all, just felt cheated. Finally, boarding time came, and I was so anxious to get on board. As I get thru the plane's door, I suddenly realize, is this a joke? Did I step into the wrong plane? Where is all the bedazzle, all the luxury, all the hype Emirates told me I should expect? As I walk thru first class, business class and finally economy, I am hit with the realization of stepping into an old aircraft, that is outdated and challenged in sophistication, style and leg room. Delta, United or American Airlines would have offered the same experience, so what makes Emirates the best economy airline in the world? This was scheduled to be a 14 + hour flight from Fort Lauderdale to Dubai, can't Emirates use the most comfortable, newest aircrafts for these long-haul flights instead of using aircrafts that should only be used for local or short flights? Emirates certainly does not think so. Employee's presentation, another let down, no gorgeous counter or on-board flight attendants which left a lot to be desired, not all smiles here, far from the gorgeous look I was expecting. Cabin service was a let down as well, for a 14-hour flight, I would have expected more than just dinner (when dinner was served, I had the Szechuan chicken, it was tasteless). Breakfast, a wine selection and at least a couple of snack offerings throughout the 14-hour flight, we had to get up and ask for water several times. Overall my first experience flying with Emirates was nothing as expected, it was just as underwhelming as flying with any other average airline in the market. I will say that Emirates has a brilliant marketing strategy, unfortunately, it took one time flying with them to debunk all the hype and to make me want to fly Delta or American internationally, again.",Detractor
" Cairo to Bangkok via Dubai. Don't get fooled once you see an attractive ticket price, as those attractive prices have a dark side in the T&C, especially when you are dealing with a big airline like emirates, so they never solve the problem once it happens, and you start getting bullied by their complaint department. You will be surprised after all the marketing they do and ads, and they have those monsters in their back office! what even make it worst, is that I am a regular customer since 2008 & I am on their skyward mileage reward, with a very good/strong history but still wasn't enough, and they unleashed those complaint team on me. I bought a ticket with a stopover in Dubai, and I wanted to extend my trip for only 1 day more, so I went to their office and was notified that there is a condition in my ticket which doesn't allow me to stay 1 more day (Max 7 days), and if I want to stay then I have to pay several penalties which ends me up with paying almost the same price I paid for the 1st ticket! So I asked the guy to check if I buy a new 1 way ticket on the same date and surprisingly it was half the price of those penalties they wanted to apply on me! So I submitted a complaint, and asked if there is a solution, as simply the penalties doesn't make any sense especially when the 1 way ticket is half the price of the penalty, and I also mentioned that who has the time to read the T&C unless he/she has nothing to do in the world, and I ended up my complaint with some cute pressure that if there is no solution, then I would like to cancel my skyward. The complaint department replied with we know that you read the T&C and we should apply those conditions on you, and there's no way out and please confirm that you want to cancel your skyward so we start processing the cancelation! They left me with no solution except checking 1 way ticket back. Anyway, I only wanted to share my story so no one get fooled like me, and if you have the time to read the T&C then please do - otherwise you will get bullied by their complaint department.",Detractor
" Cebu to London via Dubai. The worst airline I've flown with. From check in to connecting flight in Dubai. The staff and cabin crew were rude. They have false reassurance that someone will assist me with my connecting flight which is just 1 hour and 30 minutes apart. I was desperate because even the checkin service staff on my connecting flight did not know where I'm supposed to go. She was even rude and unapproachable. And on top of it all, I am still missing with one luggage. When I got into the luggage desk they were all sarcastic. I have been travelling a lot and I have never been so badly treated like this before. Very lousy service. I'm very disappointed and so devastated because I still am waiting for my luggage. From the stress that I have that I'll miss my connecting flight in Dubai to Heathrow since I checked in in the Philippines, to the handling of my luggage I am extremely dissatisfied.

" My daughter has travelled with Emirates a couple of times and had excellent experiences and hence recommended me to take Emirates to fly back to India from the US. I was travelling alone and my daughter had booked wheelchair assistance for my entire itinerary. I suffer from varicose veins and also had recently injured my knee, both added up causing unbearable pain. I was offered wheelchair assistance at DTW (Michigan) airport where I boarded the flight and my daughter went home relieved that I would be provided wheelchair assistance for the rest of my itinerary. However, I was left in the lurch when I arrived in Boston airport to board flight to Bangalore via Dubai. I had very little time left to board the flight and had to push myself to walk fast with the unbearable pain. This continued in Dubai airport as once again there was no wheelchair assistance provided in Dubai. I somehow managed this time as I had two hours twenty minutes to board the next flight.

I was totally disappointed as to how a passenger could be left unattended to by a reputed airline in spite of the request for wheelchair assistance/help.",Passive
 Dubai to Manila. Old 777 was the equipment used in this sector. IFE was not good as it was old. Every 10 seconds if you are watching a movie or listening to music it buffers. I decided to stop what I was watching instead. I cannot complain to the crew as I notice the same issue with all other passengers when I looked at their screens. The crew is not good.

" Emirates service has really gone down in the last few years. Probably, it has resulted from the cost-cutting measures they had to take. It's competition Qatar Airways has, on the other hand, improved quite a lot and even Etihad has better service on some parameters. On my last trip I observed the following: 1) The flight was delayed from 4.10 to 4.40 from India according to the announcement but the flight actually started boarding at 5. Because of this most of us were running for our connecting flights in Dubai. 2) At least 10 passengers when reaching Zurich couldn't find their luggage and we hope to get it tomorrow. 3) They recently introduced a 20kg limit on international flights for the economy class. What a good way to surprise customers and make more money. 4) I cannot explain how rude the staff were. 5) The toilets were not clean and the body lotion was not refilled. 6) Headphones were not working and they had to change it twice for me. Oman Air has disposable earbuds, they should learn from that. 7) Food was awful. They should learn from Etihad or Qatar. I cannot even think of comparing Lufthansa or any other European Airline.",Detractor
" Flew Birmingham to Sydney via Dubai. I fly this route frequently and this has been the worst case of passenger handling I have come across. Emirates has 2 gates (42 and 44) and 4 air bridges to load the plane, yet the affair was poorly managed and far beneath a quality airline. The attendant at the boarding gate lounge screened every boarding pass and sent various zones away to â€˜take a seat' (when there aren't any seats near the gates). Perhaps use of a sign or 2 would be wise. Perhaps Emirates you can find a way to load a plane through 2 lounges without treating the passengers as inconvenient cattle. The staff gave poor instructions and were cranky with the crowd. Comments like â€˜you'll all get on' shouldn't be needed. At one point we were all told to line up against the glass outside the lounge like school kids. Enough to go back to Qatar or Etihad on my next flight.",Detractor
" Chicago to Dubai in business class. 20 minutes after take off I pushed the button requesting a flight attendant as I needed a drink before I take my medicine to get some sleep. 15 minutes later no one showed up, I assumed and understood that they may be busy helping others.

Can't you wait? I politely kept silent until I got my drink and went back to my seat. Few hours later and I had been no longer than 6 minutes in business class lavatory I heard banging on the door. I signaled I heard the knocking. Another minute later the banging started again as I was finishing washing my hands. Hurried up to open the door only to find the same staffd was knocking asking if all OK and questioning why I spent that much time in the toilet? I never responded but politely requested the purser who came to apologize. We all know that their service level is on the decline but never thought it would get that low.

" Hamburg to Mumbai via Dubai. Emirates has been long projecting themselves as a premium airline but things have gone down the drain. While making online check-in, they only provide to reserve seats in the middle (check the attached picture). Aisle seats are basically reserved for higher class of Economy. This is unacceptable because it should be based on first come first serve basis. That's one of the reason why passengers do online check-in! For the return flight, aircraft was very light but the check-in staff was extremely stingy in regards with luggage. I was 3 kgs more than limit and when I pointed out the Emirates Online Published Baggage Policy that luggage ""not exceeding"" 32 kgs"", the staff abruptly replied ""this policy is only for US bound passengers"". But this is not mentioned anywhere. Clearly she was dodging the rule. It seemed more like, she has been instructed to shell out money. After after security check, the manager still wanted to weigh hand luggage before final boarding. Even after boarding and settling down, the manager came on-board to give us final notice that they might conduct a surprise check of hand luggage and have to pay double if found guilty. This was definitely the height! Honestly, I couldn't believe she made this announcement. On 3 out 4 flights, they served absolutely the same food, I couldn't see it anymore, forget about eating it. The staff was of mixed bag ranging between ""okay and poor"" with ""forced to work and doing a favour"" attitude.

" Glasgow to Auckland via Dubai. Emirates fell very short of their much hyped quality service on the flight from Dubai to Auckland on 26 Dec 2017. I had the misfortune to fly with them from Dubai to Auckland. The ground staff were very rude and unhelpful in Dubai, it took an age to get our boarding passes checked and when I did eventually get to my allotted seat I found someone else sitting there with exactly the same boarding pass!! the airplane was pushing back for take off while I was still standing in the galley while the air crew were trying to find me a seat! what does that say about their Health and safety and security. Anyhow the killer was that after the 17 hour flight to Auckland we had to queue an extra 3 hours in the airport to record the fact that our bags had not arrived. In fact approximately 150 bags didn't make it to Auckland so there were massive queues. Emirates ground staff were totally unprepared despite the fact that Emirates knew for at least 17 hours that our bags would not arrive at the same time as us! They wasted a day of my holiday and limited what I could do on the following day as I had to be available to sign for the bags when they were eventually delivered. We were not the most inconvenienced passengers. There were others who missed their connection to south island and several people in wheelchairs also waiting in a queue for 3 hours with no refreshments offered or seating to help those less able to stand. Any organisation that was serious about delivering a quality service would have had sufficient staff available to process our basic details so that the missing luggage could be delivered and would have had seating refreshments for those who needed it. Whilst things can go wrong its how you deal with the mishaps that determines whether you deliver a quality service. I received no apology or compensation to make up for the inconvenience and loss of a days holiday caused by Emirates failure. so many lessons could be learned from this but I doubt it will. This cant be the first time they have had such a massive failure in the delivery of luggage. I've flown several times with Emirates and had to put up with everything from missed connections to having give up my seat so that the drunk the passenger next to me could be physically restrained (a former Emirates crew member). not once have I received a formal apology or any compensation. Emirates service once again has fallen well short of what could be reasonably expected from a quality airline.

" Dubai to Bangkok, The Emirates experience has been degrading for years. Whereas flights of over 7 hours used to have two meals, they now have just one. Not even a snack can be spared on those flights (even all the European airlines they try to talk down do a sandwich or a snack half-way through the flight). Where the meals themselves would come with a lot of things on the side and used to be of good quality, you now get the same half-seasoned and half-baked meals they even offer on budget airlines. The advertised WiFi is non-existent on many flights (yes, the you can connect to OnAir but mostly there is no connection behind it). The quality of their crew has been degrading as well.

The food was just fine, but definitively not the same standard in quality, presentation or service like the one with competitors from Asia (Cathay) or Europe (Swiss). Emirates had excellent wines from France and Australasia on these flights, but the handling of those expensive wines by the crew was disappointing: mostly the crew filled the wineglasses completely and on one occasion the steward just filled the Great Bordeaux in the same glas I had enjoyed before a Merlot. The crew was very diverse with no minimal standard of service at all, overall plainly disappointing and a lot of times unprofessional. The best is the Entertainment systems which seems to have no limitation, definitively one of the best.

 Had a really good experience flying with Emirates from Bengaluru to Dammam via Dubai. Both flights were on time. The aircraft used on the BLR-DXB sector was a bit old. The entertainment was amazing but the touch screen was not responsive. The food was not that good to be frank and the cabin crew were very friendly. They gave toys for kids and had special food for them. Flight landed on time but we were parked away from the terminal and the bus took around 30 minutes to arrive at the aircraft. Since I had 5 hrs layover it was not a problem for me. The aircraft used on the DXB-DMM sector was a brand new aircraft and this aircraft was much better than the previous one. The screens were much larger and they were very responsive unlike the previous one but could not do much since it was only a 45 minute flight. The sandwich served was awful.

" Bangkok to Hong Kong. Emirates has changed the configuration of its daily Bangkok/Hong Kong return flight from 3 class to a reduced business class and substantially increased economy class. This results in a total of 615 passengers. The problem is that it is the front half of the upper deck that has been given over to economy resulting in premium passengers having to wait till these have disembarked before they can get off. Since lower deck passengers are also disembarking earlier, a quick exit to Immigration is now out of the question! Almost all other A380 operators more sensibly put the extra economy seats at the back of the upper deck. That said, Emirates service remains excellent. The Bangkok lounge offers a wide range of food and drink. On board hot towels are lightly scented and lunch menus have a choice of 3 entrees and superb wines. The bar offers premium liquors and many different canapÃ©s for those not wishing the full meal. I just have two slightly negative comments about the on-board service. With the reduced business class it would be nice if an after take-off drink is offered. Frequently one has to wait for up to 45 minutes for the meal service to start before any drinks are brought round. Secondly, despite the huge variety of entertainment offered, I still find the revised entertainment programme guide a total design mess. It is impossible to find out if movies are comedies/dramas/action etc. Worse, the guide provides no timings, so you have no idea if you have enough time to watch a full movie. The only way to check length is by wasting time loading each individual movie. For the price, though, EK remains an excellent choice on this route.",Promoter

I had a sore throat and a cough while traveling so I went straight to the gate to request for a window seat and explained my condition to them but they denied my request. Over time, my health deteriorated a little more. When I went up to the gate staff to talk to them again, they called the medics to get me checked. The medics said I was okay to travel but at this point, the gate supervisor demanded for a doctor's note to ensure I was okay to fly. I don't understand why they needed a doctor's note when we the medics said okay. Anyway, I tried to convince the supervisor because it was incredibly important for me to get back to New York on Tuesday morning as I had some important meetings lined up. They refused. I was taken to the doctor which was one building away, and given some medicine. The doctor gave me a note in no time and I was sent back to the gate without any assistance. They took me to the hospital on the airport hospital shuttle but I was made to walk back in that condition. It took me 20 minutes to walk back to the gate to find the supervisor, who had told me I would be moved to the next flight instead once I have the doctor's note. There was no one at the gate and I was directed to the ticketing counter. After waiting the long line, they asked me to pay for my new flight, which I refused to do. First off, being a college student, I did not the money to pay for another ticket. Secondly, it wasn't my decision to not board the previous flight. The gate staff decided on my behalf and I shouldn't be made to pay for a decision they made. I tried to explain my situation to the person at ticketing but they were no help and asked me to wait another hour to see the manager, because there was a shift change apparently and they said I couldn't be helped. I finally got to see the manager and she directed me to the PRO office and said it wasn't in her hands. I walked to the PRO office and begged for help because at that point, I felt vulnerable. I was exhausted and hadn't sleep in over 24 hours. They kept stalling me and sending me to different authorities. I waited until 7 and then finally the PROs called me in only to tell me I had to pay 740 AED for a flight change and that's all they can do. I felt emotionally drained so I did whatever they said to just get back home. As a consequence, I missed my flight from JFK to ROC which I had to rebook at an extra cost. I always loved flying with Emirates but this trip was very disappointing. I was treated badly and wasn't helped by any of the staff.",Detractor
 A disappointing experience. Flew with Emirates on the A380 from Christchurch to Sydney. Had high expectations from my previous flight. Emirates have a fantastic hard product on the A380. Great spacious seat and fantastic entertainment systems. The food onboard the flight was great with a great selection of onboard beverages and well-presented meals. I was very disappointed by the crew and received dull and uninterested service. The staff seemed to have no interest in the guests traveling. The service was efficient but cold. Certainly room for improvement for a so-called leading airline. I would not recommend Emirates if traveling in business class. There are alternative airlines that with great products and personalized service where you will have a more well rounded experience.,Passive
" Flight 229, Dubai to Seattle. I last flew Emirates business class two years ago and it was good. Since then, quality has severely declined. The aircraft for this flight was - according to the attendant - 15 days old. They attendants didn't know how to use the seats. The seats themselves we not much wider than economy class. Though they were lie-flat seats, the seats were â€œcuppedâ€ so you sunk into the middle when you lie them flat. Uncomfortable! This could have been softened by an attentive and helpful staff member however even getting water was difficult. The flight attendants didn't offer anything between breakfast and lunch nor between lunch and dinner. For business class, this is completely unacceptable. I had to ask several times just for water. When I said thank you, they did not even say 'you're welcome'. Really awful.",Detractor
" This was our first time flying Emirates and likely our last. We have taken many other business class flights before and the service provided on every single other carrier, even American and Chinese carriers, far exceeded Emirates. The hard product is excellent with the full floor lounge in Dubai, good seat and bar on the plane. However, the biggest issue is that none of the crew seems to want to be there. It's all a production line mentality. The service falls below what one would even expect in Economy. Also the food was very inferior given past reviews we had read about Emirates. In short, given the price point we would never fly Emirates again when there are usually cheaper business class seats on other airlines with better service.",Detractor

I tried to get the assistance of their ground agent by asking some practical questions. Such as could I leave the airport and come back later? As a UK citizen what would be my immigration status be etc? The agent refused to help me on the grounds that the flight delay/cancellation was due to extraordinary circumstances. His words were ""You are on your own on this one. You can go to Singapore if you like, that is very nice.""

" Manchester to Bangkok via Dubai. We were scheduled to fly out of Manchester airport on Wednesday 20th December at 20.35. On check in we noticed that the flight time had been changed to around 21.10. We were not notified of any changes and the Emirates staff who checked us in gave us no explanation as to why this had been moved. After being in the airport a couple of hours we then noticed our flight had been further delayed. We were meant to arrive into Dubai international at 07.45 for our flight to Bangkok at 09.35, so the fact that the flight was delayed made us worry as we did not know whether we would make our connection flight. As a result we contacted our travel agent at Flight centre about our concern whilst in the departure lounge at Manchester Airport. They called Emirates to raise the alarm that if there was a delay we would struggle to make a connection flight. We eventually boarded our flight and left Manchester almost two hours late and arrived in Dubai at 09.12. On the aircraft the captain told us that we were delayed due to the Emirates plane leaving Dubai late. We missed our flight, we had no apologies and the only option to get us to Bangkok in time for the 07.30 flight was to fly at 16.00 to Mumbai with Emirates and then a flight to Bangkok with Thai airways. This would land us at around 05.00 and in the meantime we would have a hotel room and lunch. We had to take this option but were not happy as this would mean we would lose our money on the hotel in Bangkok and our dinner reservation. However, the flight to Mumbai landed late, which caused us more anxiety then the flight to Bangkok took off late so we landed with under two hours till our next flight. I am extremely disappointed with the service I received with Emirates. The unexplained delays, unhelpful and rude staff in some cases, as well as missing our night in Bangkok was just not good enough. We were travelling for over 36 hours to Bangkok when we should have been there over 12 hours earlier. Whilst we appreciate that Emirates put us onto alternative flights to get to Bangkok we should have already been on the 11:45 flight as soon as our travel agent had contacted whilst we were still in Manchester. It was not the perfect start to our honeymoon, we spent time hanging around airports or on planes.",Detractor
" Newark to Dhaka via Athens and Dubai and back to Newark via same routes. Dreamed about these long haul flights, but got very disappointed - what has happened to Emirates? No longer the comfortable journeys I had enjoyed previously. Service extremely poor and chaotic. No air hostess seemed to care in spite of pointing out several times. Disappointed to find no pre-dinner drinks or appetizers, but only a good-looking menu with a list of fancy items - not so delicious to eat, unfortunately. They missed serving me dinner while most of my fellow passengers were enjoying theirs. Had to call an exhausted air hostess twice, but all in vain. Got my dinner after 30 min when all my co-passengers finished eating. Drinks were very sparse, not offered more than once, coffees were cold and tasteless, and most foods were poor and stale - mostly carbohydrate-heavy with almost no green salads. Not the best airline for service I have flown with for some time across the oceans. On my return flights an online offer popped up during the online check-in to upgrade to business class, but I got to upgrade for the first leg of the journey only - not the entire route as the offer disappeared on my second try (it gave me only one chance to upgrade). Not impressed with the business class kit-bag or other amenities. Couldn't sleep in the modernized recliner at all. Free business class lounge uses at Dubai airport were not offered in spite of buying an upgrade. I am sorry for Emirates that used to be one of the rare 5 star airlines. From Dubai to Athens to Newark, the rest of the journey was more like you would expect from a budget airline. Really disappointed, won't recommend to any friend or family, and will try to avoid in the future, unless a genuine offer is made.",Passive
" Flew from Kuala Lumpur to Rome via Dubai. The standard has declined drastically. The previous time I had flown with Emirates before this was in 2011 and it was fantastic, especially the food and service on board. Now, it is disappointing. The food selection was horrible. Snacks and drinks very sparse. The cabin crew took a long time to serve our meals. The Emirates lounge in Kuala Lumpur was not given to Economy passengers for free, unlike in 2011. The inflight entertainment was okay. Some headsets do not work. Flights were not punctual. There was a slight delay in all the flights throughout my journey with Emirates this time.

However, the cabin crew checked us and ensured that we and baby were fine during the flight. Food was above average and I do like it. Coffee was warm but I would like to get it hot.

" Dubai to San Francisco. I do not think this airline cares about its economy class passengers. This is a very long flight. Two hours into flight, they did not even provided a cup of water.

Food menu had two choices, yet when time came they told us only one item is available, like it or not. The item were half cooked. They should have told us that no food will be available.

" Trivandrum to Seattle via Dubai. Recently I had a travel interstate in India in a volvo bus where the ticket was 600 per head and the push back seat gave full comfort of sitting and sleeping overnight during a 8 hours travel.

" Dubai to Colombo. Emirates stand as my preferred choice and the reason I pen these lines is to draw attention to a trend that seems to be slowly creeping in and lowering the standard. I travel economy as I have a back problem and feel more comfortable in the small harder seat sitting straight through a flight. My ticket was purchased in economy, I subsequently received a mail to state that I had been specially selected for an upgrade on a small payment. I did this only to offer the seat to my son, I later realized that most of the passengers had received the same message. This is actually a rip off as if I were to have bought a CCL ticket directly it would have cost me AED 3035/- here with the ug's it ended up a little more but minus the CCL benefits. Baggage, limo and lounge. Unlike several years ago when the crew looked stunning and of a better background today they seem to be quite poorly behind the uniform. Gone is that poise and flare. On my return journey the crew managed to tick me off with her carelessness and rudeness. If I had never travelled Emirates before it may have been my last. Food not to my liking, Crew - stay in your pantry. Regular seats limited pitch not suitable for the tall and well built. Inflight movies - great kept me busy. Tickets - great value for money but paid upgrade - should be avoided",Passive
" Brisbane to Birmingham via Dubai. We flew on an overnight A380 Emirates flight from Brisbane to Dubai in late September, leaving Brisbane late at night. Flying time was 14 hours 20 minutes non-stop. This was sleeping time - I thought. I paid the extra $55 to select seats in economy for my wife and myself. I boarded and sat down to our long haul flight on a seat that was already broken. The recline wouldn't lock in, and made an awful clunking noise whenever I moved the seat back or forward. After a few hours I had worked out that if I pushed back hard and held on with my feet and my back I could get the seat to recline. But as soon as I let the pressure off it immediately sprung back â€“ in fact it sprung back past normal upright. You can imagine the result - 14 hours plus of long haul discomfort, battling with this seat! Naturally I couldn't keep it up for the whole flight, and so after a few hours I sat upright â€“ or past upright. Given that the seat in front was fully reclined, while mine was leaning forward, I couldn't even put my head on the tray table. I mentioned the problem to the Emirates staff on board, but nothing could be done as it was a full flight, they said. So I left it at that. On our return home to Brisbane a month later I wrote to Emirates about the matter. They said that they would respond within 30 days, after they had gathered the facts. On day 30 I had no answer, so I prompted them for a reply. Yes, they eventually said in their response â€“ the seat you selected was in fact broken on that flight - we knew about it as we had a logged report on it. Sorry to hear that you didn't find the flight comfortable. (They obviously knew about the problem on the day that they received my email - but they deliberately held out responding for the full 30 days â€“ hoping, no doubt, that I'd forget the matter.) They went on to say:- â€œGiven that you had availed of the Advance Seat Reservation and paid AUD55.00 for the seat, we will be pleased to refund this charge to you. Kindly provide your bank details in order to process a bank transfer to your accountâ€¦.thank you for taking the time and trouble to write to us. â€ That was it. If I had not paid $55 to select the seat â€“ would Emirates have just written back (after 30 days) to say, sorry about your long uncomfortable flight in our broken seat, but too bad â€“ nothing more we will do? If you are an economy class traveller like me, find an airline where passengers like you and me have had some genuine, and timely, resolution to their genuine issues.

" Budapest to Colombo via Dubai. If I can name the most child hating airline, than Emirates must be the one. It was 4 flights but each and everyone was a nightmare. We travelled with our 1 year old son. He was offered food on 1 of the 4 flights only. We weren't asked even once if the baby is all right, if we need any help but we were harassed several times instead. The seats were uncomfortable and narrow, the on-flight entertainment hardly worked, once the screen was broken, once it was frozen and had to be restarted, once the console were broken, 3 different flights, 3 different problems. The utensils were dirty in the sealed pack and the food were terrible but hey it's economy so this would be least problem of ours. All in all the staff was probably the rudest it can be, we hardly met any kindness or smiles, although they cooled down the aircraft to something between 15 and 10 C degrees they arrogantly collected all the blankets way before landing so we almost frozen to death. At least it made us understand why some people are flying in winter jackets near the equator. There is no way we are going to use them again.",Detractor

The first confirmed the availability of the flight that would leave after an hour and sent me to the second to pay, after the payment sent me back to the first to collect the tickets, at the end after having lost more than half an hour for the queues the attendant told me to run to another gate to get the flight just paid or I would have lost it.

Firstly the website said there were no business class seats available, My live chat confirmed this. I then asked again in Johannesburg (8 hours before the flight I wanted business class flights for). Again I was told they were overbooked. When I asked I asked again in Dubai I was told, â€œyes, there are a fewâ€ just ask the cabin crew, which I did. I was told $1500 per person.

The cabin looks and feel tight, though I am neither tall nor fat. The seats? It isn't worth commenting. Landing in Dubai for the transit to London, expect the usual UAE approach. Their ground service is next to zero. The Emirates lounge is big but not fantastic, it's overcrowded if anything. Boarding my flight to London was ok, but once onboard, again, do not expect good service. Some cabin crew try to smile, that's about as good as you can get. Once the plane is cruising, they go on their ""switch-off"" mode (chit-chat, etc) more than they are willing to serve.

Later, I had a layover at Dubai airport before my final destination. Just before boarding, the person at the gate charged me more than 150$ for my hand-carry again, when I told him specifically that I was charged at the London airport to move the weight to my checked in bag. The staff was extremely rude and apparently were even charging people who bought stuff from the duty-free shop. It seemed like Emirates was in desperate need of some extra cash. Since the flight was about to depart, nobody could really do much. There was a lot of anger and frustration. I was charged twice for almost the amount of a new ticket, and it did not make any sense. I am still unable to understand why and how the hand-carry at London airport that met the weight need (especially after moving the stuff to the checked in bag and paying for it) was charged again at the Dubai airport?

Starting Sunday 10th December in Frankfurt/Germany I finally arrived Tuesday morining at 5 am in Hyderabad/India. For those who donÂ´t know - this flight usually takes not more than 14 hours. It all started with a delay due to weather-conditions in Frankfurt. Well things like this happen, but sitting for more than two hours in the plane waiting for de-icing, Emirates weren't able to serve even a glass of water to passengers. The flight itself to Dubai was ok. In order to get the connecting flight to Hyderabad/India my colleagues and me were running through the airport and finally reached the gate right on time. Everything went fine, we even managed to be at the gate more than 30 min before gate-closing - that was my thought. Here the nightmare begins: At the check-in counter the supervisor told us that our seats had been already given away without any further explanation. This is something I can't understand, I also know from another colleague sitting on the plane that the flight even had free seats (in business as well as in economy). The supervisor told us to go to the customer service counter to raise our issue and clarify how to move on. This happens around 3 am in the morning. Obviously we were not the only one, there was a long lane of passengers at the counter. We were forced to wait more than 2 hours in a line, standing on our feet without seeing any Emirates-employees offering us water, food or just some friendly words. At their home-hub in Dubai? At this point in time around 5.30 in the morning, we were already tired and exhausted. After a long explanation to the service-employee, we managed to get a hotel and an alternative flight for the next evening. In order to check-in into the hotel we need to immigrate to Dubai (another 30min of waiting at immigration) and get a hotel voucher (another 30min of waiting at another Emirates counter). Than the hotel-shuttle was overbooked as well so we pay a taxi out of our pocket to get to the hotel. Next several misses. 7 am in the morning, we got welcomed by a long lane of grounded passengers waiting at the counter to check-in. Two hours later at 9 am in the morning I finally enter my room try to get some sleep. Summary: On a long distance journey things can take a turn for the worse due to delays and this is quite normal. But: I can't understand why they acted like this. There was no apology and the inconvenience was tremendously high. This was my first experience with Emirates and at the moment I am not looking forward for the flight back to Germany.",Detractor
" Flew Hong Kong to Bangkok. Despite getting negatives review Emirates is getting these days, my flights to and from Hong Kong went so smoothly. On both flights crew were lovely, smiling and efficient. This A380 had the first class removed and replaced with economy in the front of the upper deck. A bit odd but makes good sense, as the lounge bar is at the back, cutting economy class at the back will not make sense at all. 20K is a lovely window bulkhead seat, feels really private, everything is perfect working order. Welcome drinks and hot towels, crew were cheerful and happy to engage in a little chit chat. Wifi is free and unlimited, if you are a skyward member travelling in business and first class, regardless of the tire level. Connection is fairly good throughout most of the flights. Meals were delivered with everything on one tray, nice presentation and good taste. Champagne and all kind of alcoholic drinks are plentiful and free flowing should you require. Both flights were under 3 hours, sweet but short. With such competitive price comparing to other airlines, I have no hesitation to choose EK on this route, and also to the Middle East and Europe.",Promoter
" London to Ahmedabad via Dubai. I was travelling by business class on the A380 from London to Dubai. I was impressed by the look of the bar and lounge area. I decided to take a couple of pictures and videos of the same to show the look of the lounge to my family. But an Indian flight attendant really rudely asked me to stop clicking pictures and said that if any crew member has been clicked to delete my videos as I can get involved into legal matters. This was embarrassing and humiliating for me as other crew members and passengers could hear this and started staring at us. He would not be wrong in saying this to me but there is a way of requesting for something. I went back to my seat and sat there for a while. I certainly didn't expect this treatment especially from the Emirates crew after paying so much for the service of the business class, my husband being a gold class member. Really disappointed with my trip. Food was average. I filled have filled a feedback form on the same date saying this but there is no response or apology. Disappointing!",Detractor

" Birmingham to Nairobi via Dubai. First problem was on checking in. I thought I might be one Kg over but imagine my surprise when I was told I was 6kg over! I had thought that my laptop was separate from my hand luggage allowance. In 2015 when I traveled on the same airline I got 46kg allowance. The clerk said I would have to pay excess baggage. I asked to speak to her supervisor and he said that was right, I'd have to pay. â€˜Magnanimously' he reduced the charge to half, 3kilos, which was Â£126. This is a right royal ripoff as I regularly send air parcels to Kenya for Â£4.25 per kilo. I could not afford to leave any goods behind as I was traveling by myself. I was furious and paid the Â£126. One would think Emirates would want happy customers, but after paying Â£700 for my ticket and Â£1000 for my wife to follow me next week I was far from happy. Need to look next time I fly to an alternative airline. To be honest I've never found Birmingham Emirates check in very friendly, I feel like I'm being tolerated, not valued. Well the flight was no better, took off late and food took three hours to be served from takeoff, I'm a diabetic and starting to feel quite unwell by the time I got a choice of only one main course which is the usual mushy tray of stew-like substance. Dubai airport is nice but it's a long trek to the gate followed by a long bus ride to the terminal. Food was again usual poor fare and just before landing a passengber sitting close to me vomited all over himself and he just sat there comatose. I assume he had been drinking before/during the flight and was blotto. There was no apology from cabin staff and although many passengers were retching from the smell onboard, no air fresher was brought by stewardesses! The visa and passport control in Nairobi was a fiasco and it took about an hour to get through although we still had to wait a long time for our baggage at reclaim. This was not a good trip!",Detractor
" I bought Two tickets for same route Colombo to Melbourne via Singapore and return Sydney to Colombo. At the purchased time System shows that I can earn about 43000 Tier and 48000 miles for each ticket. The first ticket I bought to travel in November and second for travel on February 2018. After I used first trip Colombo to Melbourne, before return from Sydney to Colombo I saw on Emirates Apps that the my Tier and miles cutting to half. After I make contact with Emirates, Asking I send any screenshot from miles was offered to me. I think no any one people think any airline want to cut or cheat to take any screenshot from miles. Just I keep my ticket and no miles shows in tickets. After I come back from first trip, I requested Emirates to see computers logs and later Emirates just said sorry was miles calculated in error. I asking supervisor to take look in my case and miles credited to my account for fist ticket. I requested to do same for second ticket. But until now I didn't find that emirates do for it. Many peoples compare routes and flights that can make more tier and miles for more benefits. So this is important for me to recover my Miles. I suggest to all taking full screenshots from any ticket and other documents may can show later to not cut or cheat anything by airlines.",Detractor
" Flew Emirates from Dubai to Manchester. Unfortunately I became unwell approximately 1.5hrs into the flight, reason unknown.

Return journey I upgraded to business class but was unable to use the lounge as this was a promo fare. Seat comfortable. Service good. Disappointing food once again and would not upgrade again.

" London to Melbourne via Dubai. Flight delayed in Dubai by over 3 hours because of an issue with the in-flight entertainment in First Class - nothing wrong with the aircraft and could have taken off on time. Flight delayed by over 2 hours arriving in Melbourne. When my husband tried to complain (he was the sole traveller in September), they gave him 15000 air miles. These have an expiry date. We did not want the airmiles, but Emirates would not entertain giving a full refund or partial refund. Very abrupt customer service. Apparently if he had not had Skyrewards, he wouldn't have got any compensation. Unfortunately we have booked for a family of 7 to travel with Emirates again next year to Australia. They are a shocking company. If anyone has any advice on what to do, I would be very grateful. Would never recommend them again. In addition - my 2 year old grand daughter has an egg allergy, when I told customer services this re. inflight meals, they told me it was my problem and to buy food for her at the airport. Maybe the CEO of Emirates needs to take a closer look at how this airline is being run and the attitude of the members of staff.",Detractor

 Milan to Dubai. I usually like Emirates but this time they really disappointed. The cabin crew was careless. The meal was bad and cabin crew didn't come when I called them just to get some water.

" New York to Mumbai via Dubai. Comfortable, clean and modern aircraft. In flight entertainment excellent. Food was decent and warm. Customer care is poor. The flight crew are running around doing whatever they feel. Most of the time they are sitting in the middle talking to each other. I have been flying internationally for last 15 years and this was the first time a crew member got upset when I made a request for water. In between meals no beverage provided. Even when meal service was being done, one of the stewardess rushed past everyone so that no one could order. This airline is not worth your money. Please spend a few more bucks and go to Qatar Airways where you will be respected as a human being or go cheap on Etihad as they are worth what you pay. Emirates no longer cares about its customers. I regret spending my money and keeping my expectations high with Emirates. Never will I fly them again.",Detractor
" The chauffeur service (always a Mercedes) and lounge provided in Delhi was great. The flight from Delhi to Dubai was uneventful at 4am except that the steward was helpful and smiling most of the time. That was a delight which was dampened by a remote bay arrival into busy Dubai. The lounge in Concourse A helps you board directly from the gate which is great. It is not as good though as the lounge in Concourse B. The flight to Toronto featured a new business class cabin on the upper deck with no overhead bins on the window side. The flight was full and the flight attendant, although tired at the fag end of 14 hours could not do enough. The bar was a superb place to hang out when I was tired sitting on the seat - and this leads to being overfed on even a long haul flight - you cannot stop picking at snacks at the bar. I did feel the seat/bed was a bit too tight (even though I am a relatively smaller person). The food and IFE continues to be outstanding. Also wifi is free for business class passengers and I was connected inflight almost all along. Arrival at Toronto airport was fuss free and it is a however a bit difficult to locate the chauffeur service at exit. Would definitely recommend the glamorous experience on Emirates.",Promoter

" I have been flying with Emirates for 6 years as they offered good customer service, and did not sell exit row seats. No longer it seems. I recently booked a flight from London to Denpasar via Dubai, only to find after paying for the flight that Emirates now charge for exit row seats, in this case an additional Â£150. I immediately called Emirates to discuss this to see if anything could be done. The representative said my options were to pay for the seats, pay a Â£100 cancellation fee or email customer services. I emailed customer services highlighting that it is poor customer service and even worse business process to not show the potential full price of the flight until after the customer has booked and requested a fair and reasonable solution. The representative said my options were to pay for the seats or pay a Â£100 cancellation fee. Shame Emirates. Emirates did not show the full price and are using a misleading process that sells a ticket without showing the potential full price. Even easyJet and Ryanair show users the full price of their tickets before purchase! Emirates used to be a company that put customers at the heart of the business. I guess now it is just money.",Detractor
" Emirates appear to be upgrading a lot of Economy passengers to Business. At check in the Business Class was only partially occupied on the Madrid-Dubai segment, indeed a few days before check in occupation was very sparse. On the day of travel it was almost full. So where did all the passengers suddenly appear from? I can only guess that they were upgrades, unless Emirates are bulk selling Business seats at lower prices through bucket shops. In either case, it seems extremely unfair on people like myself who have paid full price out of our own pocket, since the service for so many passengers is obviously not as good and why should I have to pay three times as much as my neighbour for the same seat? To add insult to injury, Madrid and Barcelona are Emirates' most expensive business class departures cities in Europe. Example Madrid Australia return is 5000 euros + from Madrid but less than 4000 euros from Paris or London. Having paid above the odds and then to see an invasion apparently from Economy Class is simply insulting.",Detractor
" Dubai to Zurich. Our flight to Zurich departed on time and we were warmly welcomed by the crew, who provided a very attentive and excellent service on a full flight. The spacious cabin and very comfortable seat made it also a very relaxed flight. The food and drinks were again of very high standard. The chauffeur service during my trip was excellent, always punctual, and the service made travelling very smooth!

" Melbourne to Auckland Due to a medical emergency on the incoming flight from Dubai, the flight from Melbourne to Auckland was delayed by 4 hours. Emirates did sent a text message well ahead of the originally scheduled departure so there was no need to rush to the airport.

They provided an exceptional service and made me feel very welcome. They were just the best! Auckland to Dubai Boarding again was smooth and the flight departed on time. I looked forward to one of the longest non-stop flights on the A380 and I was not disappointed. A very friendly crew provided a superb service from start till the end of this long journey. Dinner was served not too late after departure so that we could settle in for a good sleep. The meal options and wine offerings were again fantastic. For those still feeling hungry, there were additional options of warm and cold snacks available and prepared throughout the flight by the crew. Also, there were plenty of hors d'oeuvres on offer at the bar. The brilliant inflight entertainment system helped to ease any boredom on this long flight.

" Zurich to Melbourne via Dubai. I was punctually picked-up by the chauffeur drive service, and had a smooth check-in and quick transfer through customs & security to the lounge. Boarding commenced on time and I was welcomed by a very friendly and helpful cabin crew. The crew was very attentive and provided excellent service throughout a full and very busy flight. My window seat was very comfortable with lots of legroom and also a small little mini bar with soft drinks, which were replenished throughout the flight. The food offered on board was excellent and Emirates' wine list is of very high quality. Both food and wine offerings were very generous. The inflight entertainment system is the best and has a fantastic selection of movies, shows and music. The A380 is a wonderful plane to fly in, very quiet, spacious and the bar of course is one of the highlights. Overall, I had a great flight. After a 3 hour break I was due to board the connecting flight to Melbourne. Fog in Dubai though caused a delay but we were kept well informed by ground staff and once boarding started it was smooth. The A380 cabin as well as the service in this very busy flight (full business class) was again fabulous. Maybe just something trivial, but I loved that one could adjust the window blinds individually by pressing the respective buttons. The free inflight wifi in business class is brilliant and I enjoyed keeping in touch with friends along the trip. I managed to sleep for most of the flight and after a light breakfast (there are various breakfast options available, I decided to choose the lightest version) we landing in Melbourne.",Promoter
" Not close to what we expected. We now understand why Emirates is not number 1 anymore. We are frequent travellers going to various locations, always Economy. The flights with Emirates from Frankfurt to Male via Dubai and same way back were pretty ""interesting"". On all flights we were pretty confused that the blankets we used to keep us warm were taken away before landing, same counts for the earphones. (We had our own but even them they wanted to take away, crazy). The Cabin crew was not pretty helpful and especially soft drinks were not offered often enough, even on request we were simply ignored, maybe because of being Economy guests. Highlight was that the cabin crew lady poured me with Mango juice and did not even say a word. The food experience was average, other airlines offer much better food from a quality perspective and also from the options you have. Entertainment was pretty good.",Detractor

And the staff is completely dabbing, no matter what your request, it's always ""no"" ""we can not"" ""we'll see"", never seen people who had so much nothing to do, even for luggage!

" Frankfurt to Bangkok via Dubai. I understood from the crew that Emirates has a new policy to overbook the economy class and upgrade all remaining passengers to Business class. That is what happened on the both mentioned flights, more than 50% passengers got free upgrades to Business. So C class was totally full on the huge A380 results in poor service because the FAs were totally overloaded with this high amount of people. On the flight from Frankfurt to Dubai I had to wait more than 3 hours until they served the dinner. Further I think this is also very unfair for the passengers who paid the business class fare. It seems that the airline is good for economy passengers but sorry Emirates this is not what business people paying a very high fare do expect.",Detractor

I am not sure they even know what it means. The stewardesses had a very arrogant, superior attitude which I found just low and disgusting. As they went down the aisle they went with hard steps as if they wanted all attention on themselves.

" Newark to Athens on Boeing 777-300 in Business Class. Emirates is a better airline than any US carrier but it aspires, it says, to be the best airline in the world. It is far from that.My flight was delayed due to some issue of getting our aircraft to the gate. The information about this delay was non-existent at check-in. I found out about the delay only after the agent in the SAS Lounge (who doesn't work for Emirates) told me about it. Eventually, we were told the flight was boarding. We left to discover nothing of the sort. The gate area was chaos. The flight was not boarding, not even close. The employees, about 6 in number, were glued to their smart phones texting and surfing. I would fire every last one of them. They made infrequent and irregular announcements, with incorrect information. The boarding time kept getting moved. The employees sat on their phones. Finally, we started to board. Well, not the Premium passengers. First, the people traveling needing extra assistance and with children. Eventually, Business class boarded, but only after an Emirates person line jumped with a group of passengers in front of us. Once on board, I encountered a seat with a non-functional small video screen that is used to control the seat! Fortunately, the seat next to me was empty. The seat is not the standard these days. Angled lie flat is so 1980. Middle seats in Business Class? Are you kidding, Emirates? Whoever made this decision should be fired. The wine list contained one champagne (good selection) and two whites (one a dismal CA Chardonnay, the other a nice Sancerre) and two reds (one a pedestrian Oregon Pinot and one a 2007 Bordeaux that was quite nice). This selection pales in comparison to Qatar. Food quality was very good, although the crew wanted to rush me through the meal. I didn't let them. Eventually, they adjusted. Crew service was spotty. At times personal and nice, and at times missing or impersonal. The inflight entertainment is extensive but the system is CLUNKY to use and the endless ads before any movie is irritating beyond belief. It is also very hard to scroll quickly through the movie options. They are also poorly organized into categories, in my opinion. For the money, Qatar is a far better airline with a truly premium treatment for people in premium classes. Better seats, friendlier crews, better wine, and an overall better experience is available on Qatar. Emirates has a lot of work to do.",Passive

The seats are very narrow and leg room is nonexistent, especially if the person in front of you decides to recline the seat. Furthermore, there is a box of equipment under the front seat, further reducing room for your feet, so you can't even stretch your legs as the comfort video tells you to. I know Emirates have a few configurations for the 777, it seems they put the condensed seats on the Asian routes, profiling the average body size of the passengers. Very disappointing for Emirates. IFE is standard Emirates with many movies and options but on a very small and badly lit screen, old fashioned equipment. On the positive side, wifi was great and much faster than the A380.",Detractor
" Flew London Heathrow to Perth via Dubai. As someone who struggles to walk distances and has to use a walking cane I asked Emirates for ground assistance. This was agreed, confirmed and confirmed again at check in where they advised it had not been added. On boarding the aircraft when those needing time/assistance were asked to board I found myself behind at least 10 able bodied passengers jumping the queue. To add insult to injury, after getting on board, the stewardess then made me wait while one of these able bodied passengers messed around for 5 minutes. When I did get to my seat, I had spent that long standing and queuing that I was in a lot of pain. Thanks Emirates. Arriving in Dubai where I was supposed to be assisted, again there was no help and I had to struggle across the airport in pain. Its now 4 flights requesting assistance and zero flights where it has been provided. Emirates may be ok if you are able bodied, but if you need assistance, don't bother.",Detractor

The line was extremely long and it took me 1.5 hours to get checked in. I discussed my issues with one of the employees and told him I am not happy with the service. His response was very poor and he seemed to not understand the issue. On the flight to Delhi, we requested an Asian meal but they denied to gave us an Asian meal on the flight, which I found very strange. After reaching Dubai, the security man was asking so many question and checked my handbag very vigorously. I asked the security guy why he was being so aggressive with my belongings and he explained to me my boarding password code was ""SSSS"", which means they have to check your body and bag very seriously.

" Unforgettable experience flying with Emirates from Singapore to Rome via Dubai. I was booked on flight EK433, with scheduled departure on Friday at 9.35am but was notified last minute via text message at 4.23am that I had been put on EK353 departing at 10.10am instead.

Arrangement to make delivery of my delayed baggage was made immediately after clearing immigration on arrival in Rome FCO airport Friday at 6.40pm, when I was assured my luggage would arrive following day.

No, of course their gilded fingers can't possibly dial the number to follow up on a customer's delayed baggage. I finally received my bag on Sunday at 12.15am. Hooray for a change of clothes finally.

Just phoned them again and the 'customer service rep was just rude. I will never fly with this airline again. I thought Emirates were going to be superior but they are simply nothing special at in any department. Two months trying to get your money back due to their effective management of seating is dreadful. So be warned if you are thinking of booking seats and paying Â£20 each person per seat per flight.",Detractor
  Sydney to Cairo via Dubai. I love Emirates A380 which is great and the staff are lovely. The Boeing 777 really could use a facelift to be honest - you go from comfort on the A380 to feeling like your on a 4 hour bus ride in the sky. It is very cramped and could be configured better to help both passengers and the airline.,Passive
"  I was traveling with my wife from Tokyo to Dubai on the 3rd of November EK319 we prebooked extra leg room seats which was an emergency exit for 95$ per seat because it's a 12 hours flight, 80H this was my seat. First the crew were very noisy all the flight especially that we were beside the kitchen, they were bumping us, our legs, heads even our screens every time all over the flight putting the food & wine boxes in front of us like a storage area which also hit our legs and putting the wine boxes on the emergency exit door which is not complying with the safety regulations. We complained and the crew told us that they always tell the company about these seats that it has a problem and they don't believe them so please complain when you reach Dubai, nothing we can do it's a full flight no place to change. We stayed for 12 hours we couldn't even sleep for 1 hour from the noise of the crew it was the worst flight ever. When we went back to Dubai we went to the service center to complain about the flight experience they told us we don't have complain system you only can complain online by email. We sent our complain and wrote all the details and even the safety issues that was not applied during the flight & unfortunately they came back to us after two weeks with nothing. The flight was the worst flight experience and the customer service was disaster in case of handling our complains We paid extra money for noisy seats with untrained crew that no nothing about service treating our seats as if it's a storage area and know nothing about safety guidelines.",Detractor
"  Melbourne to Auckland. This was my second trip on this route with the same airline, and the biggest difference was the service from the Cabin Crew. The morning started with a visit to the Emirates Lounge, an excellent decision. Boarding once again was chaotic, no specific lines indicating Economy, Business or First. No one knew where to go and the Ground Team just did nothing to put order in place. When we were airborne, the onboard service started and I immediately felt the FA's were not as personal compared to my previous experience. The all seem too busy with getting the job done, rather than taking the time to engage with passengers. Food and beverages were average, though the portions can definitely increase in size. The seat was comfortable and, with blankets and pillows distributed to all passengers. On a good note, the IFE was fantastic as the amount of content can keep you entertain for hours. Overall, customer satisfaction really needs to be evaluated.",Passive
"  This was our first flight using Emirates from Glasgow to Sydney via Dubai and it will be our last. We were looking forward to flying Emirates as it had the reputation of being a luxury airline with adverts showing courteous attendants there to serve their customers with a smile. The reality was quite the opposite. The flight attendants were sullen and rude with very poor customer service. The staff at the boarding gate were quite cheery, laughing and smiling amongst themselves until it was time for the passengers to board. We met with dour stony faces - no smile, genuine welcome or attempt at being polite. We felt more like an inconvenience. Once on board we were in the air for 2 hours before any drinks were offered. Again no pleasantries just quite abrupt service. The meal was ok but breakfast after a 7 hour flight was a 2 finger shortbread biscuit. The return leg was no better, in fact worse. We experienced the same sullen attitude from the staff with the addition of an air of superiority as they marched up and down the aisle, and woe betide anyone in their way. If we happened to be standing in the aisle they would barge passed, no excuse me or waiting for you to get something out your bag. Meal service was again slow and very sloppy. The attendant spilled hot fat from the breakfast dish over my white trousers. She did get some cloths but the stains haven't come out. The other attendant passed a hot meal over my head to my husband - are they not taught how to serve customers? We were given blankets but these were collected long before the end of the flight. The final â€œthank you for flying Emiratesâ€ sounded matter of fact and so insincere. On the return we missed our connection from Brisbane to Dubai due to bad weather and were put on the next flight which was 8 hours later at 5am. We were given food vouchers but they turned out to be useless as all the shops were shut. Apart from a couple of cleaners the airport was empty. When we explained to the staff when the desk opened they showed no interest and no sign of concern for their customers' comfort. This is by far the worst airline I have ever flown with, even the cheap budget airlines have a more respectful attitude towards their customers. Next time we fly to Australia we will use Singapore Airlines again - far superior.",Detractor
"  London to Perth via Dubai. It is 10 years since we last used Emirates on this route, and they have really gone down the budget airline path since then. Plane to Perth looked worn and quite dirty in the cabin, staff service bordered on downright rude and those serving our seating area clearly had some issues about having to work. Dubai Airport has assumed the role of a large, characterless giant warehouse and the airport staff for Emirates seem to delight in shouting at passengers, and showing contempt to all. I admit the tickets were really cheap and now I realise that Emirates is going down the budget airline path with what they provide. Can only assume they have financial problems to have cut back so much on what they once provided.",Detractor
"  Dubai to Cairo. Emirates has become mass transit in their economy class. People are herded like cattle, the plane is crammed with little room and the staff is overworked as usually 100% of seats are occupied.

"  Barcelona to Melbourne via Dubai. We were looking forward to flying with Emirates - we hadn't flown with them before and had heard good things. But unfortunately the customer service (or lack thereof) from the Flight Attendants onboard both flights was atrocious. I have written over a month ago to the Emirates Feedback form on their website but have not had any response - perhaps they are overwhelmed with complaints? For a start, none of the staff seemed to be smiling or happy. I didn't really think anything of it at first until I realised how uncomfortable I felt with the sour faces around me. About an hour into the flight I thought I would use the restroom. I was on the left side of the plane in an aisle seat, row 56. I had seen other passengers walking up and down the aisle using the restrooms and so I walked forward too, where I could see the toilet sign. A male flight attendant asked me where I was going? I said, ""To the toilet. I'm going to the restroom."" He shouted, ""Back! Get back. Go back!"" and flung his arm towards the back of the plane. I was shocked at his attitude and aggression that I returned to my seat. He came over to me and said, ""You can use the toilet at the back of the plane."" I explained that I had seen other people moving freely around the plane and that I felt he had spoken to me incredibly rudely. He said I could use the toilet towards the front if I wanted. I have no idea how many international and domestic flights I have been on in my 48 years, but I have never been spoken to like that - with so little provocation! The other flight attendants were equally rude",Detractor
"  London to Mauritius via Dubai. Ruined the start of our honeymoon. Flight from London was delayed by around 30 minutes which meant we missed our connecting flight, no apology from anyone and we were moved to a flight that was 6hrs 15mins later than our original one which meant we had to wait in Dubai airport for 7 hours. Emirates staff were really unhelpful and did not compensate customers in any way, apart from a cheap meal voucher. Will never fly with Emirates again. Terrible experience.",Detractor

  Dubai to Perth. I initially travelled from Cairo to Dubai on EK 924 for which I gave an excellent review! But the flight to Perth was terrible. Staff were not even friendly nor were they interested in their passengers. I asked for a seatbelt extension and this flight attendant stood two seats away asking me to repeat what I'd said before she very unhappily went to fetch one. I did not have breakfast however lunch arrived with the Hostess telling us chicken on the menu would be 15 min late well that never arrived nor did an apology from Staff. They were standing behind the curtain and eating snacks no concern for their passengers or if they attended we felt like a nuisance so dare not ask. I tried to write a review online but that wasn't working either. All in all they were the most miserable flight attendants I've ever travelled with! We only heard from the Captain and that was it! The flight itself was uneventful!,Detractor
"  Newark to Athens. Emirates far exceeds the services provided by US carriers. I needed to change my travel dates due to a family emergency, and the ticket agent waved the change fees, allowing me to depart for Athens within the day. The service on board both ways included two full meals, nice reusable amenity kits with shades, earplugs, socks and toothpaste/toothbrush, the seats were comfortable, and the bar service featured top-shelf brands. The in-flight entertainment system was also top notch, with cameras built in to the front of the plane to provide you with a cockpit view. Economy passengers are also offered a certain amount of free wifi, which was more than enough to communicate with friends and family on the ground to inform them of my flights progress. If all of that is not enough, Emirates allows economy passengers to check in 2 bags for free!",Promoter

"  The positives for Emirates is to do with the aircraft, as the A380 offers comfortable seats with adequate legroom. The list of negatives is quite big: - Crew members didn't bother to assist during embarkation resulting a really slow process. Even worse, when most passengers had to look for available cabinets to store their luggage nobody from the crew members even bothered to pretend to be interested and assist. Passengers who wanted their dinner to be accompanied with wine or beverage had to wait more than 20 minutes to be served. Long, literally long, queues at lavatories. Crew didn't assist at all. I do understand that when the not to be disturbed sticker has fallen from the seat, crew will try to wake you up in order to serve breakfast. Still that should not reach the stage where they will literally poke you and scream close to your ears. They could either open the folded tray and leave it there or let you a note that they didn't serve because you were sleeping. Having two options for dinner (when you promote yourself as top carrier) is quite limited. Saying that you have two options for dinner when the number of available portions of one is small compared to the overall number of passengers (particular flight was almost fully booked) is laughable. Some people do not eat chicken (sounds strange but I do not eat it), I can understand that due to any reasons you are out of beef (actually I do not understand it but anyway) but that does not mean that you have to force me to get your chicken dish and refuse (actually they did not refuse, just didn't bother to reply and moved on) to take it back. Cabin wifi is great as an idea. If only someone could say how to activate it on economy class.",Detractor
"  Cairo to Dallas via Dubai. The flight from Dubai to DFW takes approx. 16 hours, I was at seat 37 A. After take off from Dubai at 3am a meal was served, and then for approx 13 hours passengers are left without any meals only a small piece of pizza. Three hours before landing another meal was served. After the first meal normally passengers go to sleep for 3-6 hours, a meal should be served after 7 hours from take off and then the last meal 2-3 hours before landing.",Passive
"  We are terribly concerned and quite upset with both the quality and quantity of the onboard meals on long distance Emirates flights. In our recent experience, there was only one meal served during our flight from Manchester to Dubai which lasted for 7 hours 30min. A tiny packet of pretzels was provided as a snack which was very inadequate and compares poorly to any other airline. There were also no sleeping kits provided which is highly unusual. On the Dubai to Kolkata flight (duration of 4 hours), the only meal provided came very late and we had to request for snacks (which were tiny packets of savoury mix) to fill in. Not to mention, the meals they provided in both flights were frugal and by far of a poor quality in comparison to any standard airline. Desserts were horrendous. We dread boarding our already booked return flight back to Manchester.",Detractor
"  New York JFK to Milan. As 400 passengers deplaned in Milan there were only two customs agents available for non European Union passengers. Poor planning to say the least. It took well over an hour to clear customs. By the time I tried to obtain my luggage it was missing. There was no one to check and see if the baggage removed belonged to the owner. What is the use of giving a baggage claim if it is ignored. Thus It is very easy to steal luggage from the airport in Milan. I had to rent a car for an additional day drive 100K to and from Verona, find a physician and obtain needed medications and clothes.One day of my vacation wasted. After 3 days I was informed that my baggage was found in Rome and that it would be sent to Venice where I was now staying. Emirates would not deliver it to my hotel and I had to go to the trouble and expense of traveling to the Venice airport to pick up my luggage. The second day of my vacation wasted. After obtaining my bag I was informed by Emirates that it would take at least 4 weeks to respond to my complaint. I'm sure that they just wanted me to have finished my travels to respond so that they would not have to upgrade my return travel. After 6 weeks I received a form letter that hid behind the Montreal protocol to tell me that they would pay for the clothes that I had purchased. No addressing of any issues or answer to any of my questions. My expenses and inconvenience went far beyond obtaining new clothes and Emirates which touts itself as â€œthe greatestâ€ fell short in its response. I cannot recommend any airline which will not enter into a dialog with an unhappy customer, address its shortcomings and fairly compensate a customer for its failures.",Detractor
"  Perth to Manchester via Dubai, returning from Paris. We have traveled with Emirates Business Class many times in the past and although not perfect, we have never had cause for complaint until now. We traveled to Manchester from Perth on 4th September 2017. Our flight to Manchester was uneventful. However, the walk (including train) to our connecting flight (EK19) was horrendous. It took at least 30 minutes to get from Terminal 3 to Terminal 1. Considering there is no significant layover time between flights, if the incoming flight from Perth had been delayed, we would have missed the Manchester flight. Another passenger who was also on the same flights looked quite ill from the strenuous walk. Many UK ex-pats live in Perth and would have been connecting to the Manchester flight, why was this flight from Terminal 1 and not terminal 3? The experience on our return flight flights was even worse. The service and food on the flight from Paris to Dubai from 30th September 2017 (EK76) was unacceptable. Food was cold (soup) and a steak that I ordered was uneatable. I asked for a glass of wine with my dinner and this did not materialise until 30 minutes after I had finished my meal. Seats were also very uncomfortable. Once again a walk and train for our flight to Perth (EK424). When the flight was eventually called we were subjected to being herded on a bus for a 10 minute drive to the plane and then had to climb a staircase to board. I have had a better embarkation experience with AirAsia and this is totally unacceptable for an airline of Emirates reputation. The flight arrived in Perth over an hour late, obviously due to the embarkation process. With the exception of the return flight from Dubai to Perth (EK424) food on all other sectors was mediocre at best and unacceptable at worst. The business class lounge in Dubai was as useful packed to the rafters and quite uncomfortable. The highlight of the flight was the food and service in the Emirates Paris Business Lounge. It is a shame that Emirates cannot maintain this consistency of service and cuisine across all flight services. We travel Business Class to Europe at least once every year and more often than not with Emirates. Given the above experience, it will be hard to choose Emirates as our carrier in the future.",Detractor

They offer thin mattresses which is a good thing because the seats are quite hard. Seat belts are a bit short and offer very limited extension capabilities. Entertainment system is awesome and so is the ""OnAir"" Internet. Good meals. It would be nice if coffee and tea could be offered at the same time they bring the meals. Not sure that the space reserved for the bar/entertainment area is really the best use of that space. Maybe adding washrooms instead would be better.",Promoter
"  The one area that consistently disappoints with Emirates is their service. I have consistently experienced poor service flying Business class with them. I've often found their economy class staff service to be much better surprisingly. I just cannot understand how an airlines that is so highly rated cannot get their service right especially in Business class. Approached the Business Class check-in person in Dubai with my wife and child and we were greeted by a grumpy lady gesturing to place our passports on the desk. No smiles, no conversation nothing, did her work, handed out our boarding passes and motioned us to the direction of the gate. Not a word was spoken. I was expecting to board directly from one of the gates at the business class lounge as generally is the case with A380 flights but we were motioned to go down to the gate and board from the gate with everyone. At the gate there was no separate boarding for business / first class, waited in the long line with everyone. Once we got into the flight, we settled down onto the amazing business class seats and was looking forward to a comfortable flight. Just then a flight attendant bumped into another attendant who was serving champagne to a customer and the whole contents of the tray spilled over on to me. I was soaked in champagne before the 14 hour journey to Toronto had even started. A quick word of apology was muttered and I was handed a towel to clean up and was directed to the washroom where some more towels were handed out while my seat was being cleaned. I returned back to my seat to find that champagne was still pouring out of the creases and cracks of my seat. I asked for one more towel and never got it. Later during the flight I asked for a headphone for my child and the response I got was ""One was placed on every seat"". That's it. I had to get one myself from another unoccupied seat. Every time the same lady came to clear my table / seat of any clutter or finished meal, I was motioned to place them on her tray. It was like she couldn't be bothered to reach out and pick them up. So I spent the flight collecting things around my seat to place it on her tray every time she came. The whole experience was really shocking especially after the fortune you had coughed up for the experience. Emirates boasts of taking extra effort to take care of children, my 3 year old's presence was not once acknowledged, the only gesture was a child's goodie bag being handed out. We also experienced similarly disappointing service at the Emirates check-in counter at Toronto airport on our way back to Dubai. No smile, no word. I asked if the flight was full to which I got the reply ""Wait I am trying to read something here"". Never ended up getting an answer. The service on the flight (Economy class this time) was however excellent. I commended them on their efforts. Makes me wonder though why the such a difference in service between the two classes? If at all one should experience better service for business class yea? I have encountered similar experiences in previous flights with them as well - generally rude and snobbish flight attendants in business class while the opposite is true for economy class.",Detractor
  Melbourne to Cape Town via Dubai. My wife and I were unable to select a seat on our flight from MEL-DXB-CPT until about 48 hour before the flight unless we pay $30 for each sector. We decided against and selected seats 48 hours before the flight. The real problem arose on our return journey from HDS-JNB-DXB-MEL. The HDS-JNB flight was with South African Airline and yet I was unable to checkin the Emirate flight from JNB-DXB-MEL. Emirates website directed us to check in via South African Airlines although the bookings confirmation numbers are different. I did online check in with South African Airline website but they insisted that I can only checkin the Emirate flights with Emirates website. Anyway we arrived in Johannesburg JNB and went to the Emirates check in desk. I explain to the check in person that we require an aisle and the next seat so that we do not have to disturb the next passenger for toilet break. After all explanation she gave us a window and middle seat. She disregarded our request. To top it up she directed our bags to MEL but will not and could give us the boarding pass from DXB to MEL. She stated that there is a regulation and restriction to do so. Surprisingly two other Australians who were checking in in the next counter were giving boarding passes with seat allocation all the way to Melbourne. When we landed in Dubai I went to Emirates service and requested boarding passes and the appropriate seats. To our surprise we were given two seats (under the same booking number). Mine was in row 66 and my wife in row 88. We were totally separated. We were told that the flight was over booked. No amount request and pleading was considered. We were told to go the the boarding gate and ask for different seats but there is no guarantee that we will be together. The Emirates staff were rude and acted like robots. Finally at the boarding gate we were given a window and middle seats. We had to constantly disturb the person sitting in aisle seat for toilet visits. The whole experience with Emirates ground staff was a shocking experience.,Detractor
"  Melbourne to Auckland. What an amazing experience, words cannot describe how great the service was onboard. From Check In, passport control and customs, everything was fast and efficient. Before departure, I decided to the visit the Qantas First Class Lounge instead of the Emirates Lounge. The plane was delayed up to an hour because of a late arrival of the aircraft from Dubai alongside with the most disorganised boarding process, other than those mishaps everything else was fantastic. Once on board I was greeted by a very lovely and attentive Flight attendant, who walked me to my First Class Suite 2A. Drinks, Arabic coffee and dates were offered right after. As I was the only First Class passenger, the attention I received was beyond what was needed which I deeply appreciated. Breakfast was served right after takeoff, everything tasted delicious and there was endless snacks and drinks on offer even when you don't even ask for it. The onboard service was just on another level, but my greatest appreciation goes to the FA who attended to me, they were just so genuinely nice. Lastly, the IFE is fantastic and always updated with new content. I simply cannot wait for my next flight with Emirates.",Promoter

I used to fly business in BA for work but last time was over 5 years ago and this service from Emirates was in a different league.

The service and room aboard the A380 was the highlight with the entire top floor complete with bar/lounge and I managed to sleep and arrived and returned almost without jet lag. The seat comfort, food and service was outstanding, all flights on time and very impressive all round. In addition the Lounges were all good and we were able to shower and freshen up in Dubai - the Melbourne lounge was particularly impressive.

There was a delay on the last leg back to Heathrow due to a technical issue and whilst the communication could have been better we were given a food voucher which was very much appreciated.

Very little information and infrequent updates but it happens. However I guess it's then how you deal with it that counts. Connections counter horribly busy in Dubai, staff stressed and barely friendly. No flight available for 36 hours, and that is with an extra connection and using a budget airline we always avoid for the second leg (Jetstar). Four hours after landing in Dubai we got to check in at the airport hotel - and only smoking rooms were available.

So I booked another ticket from another airline cost me 2000Dh. I went to Emirates HQ to complain but they said you should contact our office when you got cancel notification. I said I didn't got anything. So I lost my return ticket and I lost 2000DH. This is what I got from Emirates airline however I'm living in Abu Dhabi and I go to Dubai because I use to love this airline. I'm really disappointed and never expected that.",Detractor
"  17 B Aisle side Window seat, usual Emirates Business class seat. Crew on this occasion very friendly and efficient and knew what they were doing as I have had flights with very hit and miss service. Daytime inbound flight food good and entertainment very good. Full flight but very comfortable. The one disappointment was the foot well is not as long as the A,E,F and K seats and when 6'4"" you really notice the difference. On this flight I would always try for another seat but it was full when I booked. All in all very good flight and would recommend.",Promoter

"  Emirates is a pretty good airline if you can miss transiting through Dubai airport, which makes your trip a horrendous experience. It is exactly what I did. I chose Emirates for a flight from Brisbane to Singapore. On the positive side, crew were polite and friendly, on board entertainment was good, and I liked the food they served. On the negative side, my seat on the return flight my seat was broken. I think an airline is expected to check their seats function before long haul flights. Besides, the handling of luggage was poor. I checked in a new suitcase, but at my destination, I received a very dirty one filled with oil stains.",Passive
"  Dublin to Denpasar via Dubai. I was expecting something exceptional. The flight from Dublin to Dubai was very average. I was not impressed by the seat comfort but I had 4 seats to myself so this was very pleasant. The entertainment was average with lots of old films which I enjoyed but these could have been better structured and novel. I thought the cabin decor did not look modern. Staff were attentive and pleasant. The flight to Denpasar was crowded in a 777 which had seen better days. No seats free and staff taxed to look after us. No structure of meals was announced so was waiting for food which never came. Video screens were small and I was the lucky one who had the entertainment box at their feet - very uncomfortable. In conclusion, Emirates disappointed. As somebody said, Dubai has got out of control as a hub and standards have slipped. If Emirates want to stay on top, they need to work harder and realise if one takes the eye off the ball, standards slip fast. Just about to enjoy 14 more hours of Emirates.",Passive
"  Manchester to Mauritius return via Dubai. Outbound flight to Dubai was good. Shame the aircraft was on a remote stand on arrival in Dubai but transit to airport was ok. Flight to Mauritius was satisfactory though at times chaotic with cabin crew not very attentive at times, though understandable given full flight. Return flights were much better. Made use of the Business Class Lounge whilst on a 10 hour transit in Dubai which was excellent with great facilities - had to pay GBP 80 for the privilege but it was worth it. Wifi was ok, but very unpredictable at times dependent on how many passengers accessed it. Good to see more allowance available for no charge. No complaints. Emirates are my first choice. Good airline Meals were ok, and service was good.",Promoter
"  London to Bangkok via Dubai. I hadn't used Emirates for 3 years, and was surprised at seeing many cuts. Business class ticket was admittedly quite cheap versus other airlines, but even at lower price I felt value for money was poor. Seat comfort is not good and doesn't match many others I have flown in 2016/2017. Food okay, but nothing to mark this out as a premium cabin. IFE is good, although in reality it is not much different to the likes of Singapore, Qatar etc, just that they have loads of different languages and many very old films. Dubai Airport is now horrific, I guess reflecting how downmarket Dubai has become, and lounge was no better than sitting at a coffee shop in the main terminal. This was a 1-way ticket, and quite pleased I opted for a very different return route / airline.",Detractor
"  Dubai to Rome. The A380 has more leg room, more arm room and greater lean back. The onboard entertainment had a fantastic selection of movies, tv shows, and games for all ages.

They were let down by the Dubai airport terminal 3 which is exclusively Emirates and is sadly under equipped (lack of toilets and seating).",Promoter
"  Emirates customer service has certainly dropped their game since I last flew with them a few years ago. An overnight flight from Barcelona to Dubai - simple enough request for a toothbrush kit at end of flight to be advised they no longer do this. This is despite being given a kit only 2 weeks prior on a flight from Sydney to Dubai (to which they answered they do as its 'long haul'). Also, the beef option for the dinner meal had far too much salt in it, could not eat it. If you're not an Emirates frequent flyer it seems they do little to try to get you to become one. I'll stick to Qatar Airways in future when flying from Australia abroad, far superior service.",Detractor
"  San Francisco to Chenna via Dubai. I had bad experience with the air-host. I was given a meal that I don't eat. Upon requested to change the meal to the one I selected at the time of booking (veggie), the answer provided was that I did not select the meal. Fact is that I did select the meal as soon as I booked my ticket. In fact, later I called up the airline because I was unable to select Infant meal for all the flights and confirmed that my meal is selected. I spoke to the air-host and he replied with a question if I selected the meal. He said he'll check the file and get back. He did not. When questioned, he said he does not have any vegetarian meal. I asked for a fruit. That was my meal for lunch. For breakfast, the air-host asked ""What would you like to have (was given 2 choices)"". I said the one I selected. He replied that he does not have. I thought they don't have the kind of breakfast I was seeking. I walked up to another hostess without the knowledge of this person and she gave me the veggie breakfast. I was terribly upset, tired with baby on my lap the whole time and hungry. I confronted with him on the flight questioning his conscience of how indifferent he could be. I asked who I should contact for this. His reply was that Emirates does not handle the food and it is a 3rd party company.",Passive

"  Bangkok to London via Dubai for the 2nd time in the last 18 months. I feel that on several levels, the Emirates product has declined in quality. Being 2m tall, I normally never have issues with being allocated an exit row seat so that I can sit without my legs being restricted by the seat in front of me. 2 weeks prior to flying I had called the Emirates Call Center and spoke to a very helpful gentleman who informed me that exit seats are only allocated on arrival at the airport. Fair enough, I got to BKK early and was allocated an exit Row seat on the flight to Dubai. I was told that I would then need to be allocated an exit Row seat in Dubai. Upon arrival at Dubai which was 3 hours before the flight departed, I was told that all seats had been allocated. Nothing could be done. Thats it. Surely saving exit row seats for people who actually require them is a better way of operating? Other issues. Toilets were filthy, and were not cleaned during the flight. The cabin crew were rarely seen, and seemed quiet content to serve a passenger excess alcohol who was later abusive to passengers. Again, cabin crew were not concerned to sort or prevent this issue. If you want to treated like a herd of cattle, then Emirates are a good option. If you are looking for some basic comforts then there are many better options.",Detractor
"  Bangkok to Hong Kong. As a regular in business class on Emirates A380 on this route for 7 years, I was not prepared for what awaited me at the bag drop on Sunday. The supervisor approached me and very pleasantly asked if I would consider being downgraded to economy as the flight was overbooked in all classes. Ready to stand my ground, she made it clear that would be fully understandable. Then she explained that in return for downgrading, the airline would offer the usual business facilities - priority security pass and use of the lounge - plus an unrestricted free round trip business class ticket on the same route valid for a year. Or she could offer me a business class seat on a Thai Airways flight leaving around the same time. Having read horror stories of downgrading and long delays in getting refunds from other airlines, this transaction was conducted without any pressure and with my full understanding that the decision was mine. I took the downgrade and proceeded to the lounge for an excellent lunch. At the gate, the same supervisor took me out of the queue, handed me the voucher for the free return ticket and invited me to board first. This was exemplary service of the highest order. The flight itself was equally fine. I had a comfortable window seat in the first row of the lower deck. Service was efficient and with a smile. I did not take the full meal but the starter and dessert were very tasty. With only one runway functioning at BKK, the flight departed 15 minutes late but arrived on time.",Promoter

Food was good and we liked having proper cutlery and not plastic. We lost an iPad on the first leg of the journey and Emirates not only answere pd our emails promptly, they actually found the iPad and flew it on to an airport of our choice, which was Melbourne. The staff in the Emirates office at Melbourne were also extremely helpful and friendly. Our flight from Colombo was delayed through no fault of Emirates but they offered reassurance and assistance and we made our connection easily with just 10 minutes to go before the gate closed.

"  Singapore to London return via Dubai. It's my 3rd time flying with Emirates. This time I flew from Singapore to London, transited in Dubai for 1-2 hours. Their seats and entertainment are good and comfortable. But we are not impressed by the service of the staff. When I asked for hot tea, the staff would say ""you can ask my colleague later"", which you have to wait till you see a staff passing by. The next staff would say the same thing to me too. We had problem checking in the return flight. But there was an error saying that check in is not possible for this flight. We immediately called Emirates but the staff said online check in is not allowed at Heathrow airport, and said we have to check in when we reach the airport the next day. When we reached the airport, we were told that our return flight was canceled. We were not informed in advance. The staff ushered us to join a long queue which we stood queueing for almost two hours! When we asked what happen, can we get another flight back to Singapore? The staff said ""You will get to choose an earlier or later flight, or put up at a hotel. please talk to the next staff"". The staff didn't even apologise. When we reached the counter, staff asked for our passport, focused on the computer and passed us our boarding pass for tomorrow noon. We didn't even get to choose! So we asked if there is any other option as the one she gave us need to stay another night in the hotel and the transit at Dubai airport is 10 hours. Our flight in London was delayed 14 hours and to make matters worse, the transit in dubai is 10 hours. And we were separated. We asked to get an earlier flight, but again the staff said ""please talk to our staff when you reach Dubai"". She also asked us to reach the airport 4 hours before boarding tomorrow. We tried to enjoy our flight to Dubai and when we reached, we asked the staff to help us get an earlier to singapore. The price I bought for the ticket is for only 1-2 hours transit. 10 hours is too much. The staff said all the flights were full, she could put us at a hotel in Dubai. We rejected, not wanting to stay another day in the hotel. The staff was then willing to help us and she managed to put us on an earlier flight and we were very thankful. The flight back to Singapore was much better, the staff greeted us amicably. Totally different from the previous crew.",Passive
"  Flew Newcastle to Trivandrum via Dubai. Emirates is one of the few remaining airlines that offers a differential in Economy class. I love other airlines in Premium, Business or First but so few airlines now stand out with their Economy product. Emirates offers a fabulous economy product, the seat is comfortable, there is sufficient leg room for me at 6 foot 2. The food is good, I like being provided with a menu prior to service, a nice touch. Entertainment is the best in the sky in my experience. A free 20mb of internet browsing is extremely handy if you need to connect and do not want to spend lots of money as is the case with the relatively few airlines that offer any internet service at all. If you want more internet the prices are reasonable. Emirates crews are always in my experience excellent. My only (personal) regret about Emirates is they do not have a competitive price to fly between the UK and Brazil. Its a very long way of getting to Brazil from UK (I do this route frequently). They have such good deals to Africa and Asia I wish they would do the same for South America so I could fly with them more often!",Promoter
"  The basics are good and we had a good experience with Emirates from Bangkok to DÃ¼sseldorf via Dubai. Especially the newest A380's are very comfortable because the better seats and bigger IFE screens. On our outbound journy we had upper deck seats which are very nice and I do recommend to try to get a seat up there. The older A380's were a bit less comfortable and nice. The difference between the new and old(er) cabin is big, that's a shame. Food is good, sometimes we had to ask for a drink because the cabin crew wasn't walking around that frequently. The food, seat comfort and IFE was good. We experienced some things that annoyed us a little bit. The most important is the delays due to chaotic boarding processes. There was not enough dicipline to succeed the zone boarding system. Plus, the bad communication between staff and customers. Customer service told us it was no problem to link our luggage to Dubai only, and not to DÃ¼sseldorf as we planned a long layover to see Dubai. At Bangkok, the check-in agent told us if we wanted to have our luggage checked to Dubai, we had to pay an additional fee of 6800 baht each. Overall: I would recommend flying with Emirates because the comfort. If Emirates improved their communication, refurbish their older cabins, and improve the boarding processes it could be one of the best in the world.",Passive

"  Good bye Emirates. In January I booked flights with Emirates for my wife and me, Bangkok to Rome via Dubai, returning Munich to Bangkok via Dubai. Due to endless amendments by Emirates our trip turned out to be the worst ever. One month before departure I was informed that flight time from Bangkok to Dubai has been changed. Usually not a big deal, but I would appreciate to be asked instead of putting us on a different flight. On the flight Munich â€“ Dubai one of the flight attendant refused to offer soft drinks except orange juice and water, referring that drinks like Fanta or Coke have to be purchased at the bar. (what bar? as we were flying economy). Waiting for flight Dubai to Bangkok at the boarding area, about 15 minutes before boarding we were informed that it was changed to a different gate and new ETD will be 13:45. Right afterwards their ground staff left without further comment. We found the new gate deserted, leaving passengers for more than 2 hours alone with questions regarding connecting fights, meals or drinks. After having breakfast on the Munich to Dubai flight at around 4am, I expected at least a snack and a drink to bridge the waiting time of 2Â½ hours. About 20 minutes before boarding the ground staff appeared and informed that the departure will be delayed by another 10 minutes. 10 minutes later we were informed that boarding will delayed by another 10 minutes. At this stage a considerable number of passengers lost their patience and protested loudly. Finally boarding stated at 14:05 instead of 11:45, arriving at Bangkok at 23:45 instead of 21:25. Leaving us for uninformed, hungry and thirsty stranded at Dubai airport for more than 2 hours is unacceptable and contradicting with Emirates claim to be the Best Airline in the World. Under European legislation we would be eligible to a significant refund, but unfortunately we needed to book our flights in Bangkok. With the recent reduction of economy luggage allowance from 30 to 20 kgs (unless you are willing to pay extra $ for a â€œsaverâ€ ticket) and the implementation of a reservation fee of 25USD per person, Emirates is getting closer to traditional low cost carriers, while asking for premium rates.

  London to Melbourne via Dubai. I am a skywards gold member for over a decade. The quality of service is a bit hit and miss.

The boarding and flight to Munich on the A380 was seamless, with the bonus of the best chauffeur drive experience and facilities to my son's home, that I have had. The return trip from Germany to Durban was equally enjoyable and pleasant. Unfortunately, I need to mention two negative factors - the one being the ongoing poor selection of food at King Shaka International and the other being the chauffeur drive from KSIA, which I would prefer to elaborate on in a more private manner.",Passive
  Brisbane to Dubai. I am a skywards gold member and has used this airline for few years. The quality of late has been inconsistent with some sectors offering fantastic service but some offering poor service. I have noted that they don't strictly stick to skyward status while upgrading and some passengers with lower tier status get upgraded if flying in economy over more loyal passengers. I will be taking my business to another airline as they don't reward loyalty and service is not that great anymore.,Passive
"  Bahrain to Nairobi via Dubai. The Emirates policy of applying excess baggage charges for items purchased in duty free on the DXB to NBO sector is arbitary. I have flown Emirates on a number of occasions and have never seen a weight scale at a departure gate in DXB. Each economy passenger was directed ""as per airline policy"" to weigh all cabin bags, including those containing duty free items. The response from Emirates ground staff for extra items bought in duty free was either pay the excess or return the items for a refund from the outlet. I understand the weight limits for cabin baggage from a safety perspective. However, I have not seen any objections from an ground staff when a passenger has purchased a number of duty free items in departures. Returning on the NBO to DXB sector no similar policy applied, same for the DXB to BAH leg. Emirates need to treat all passengers as people. Staff at the gate ignored my request to have the extra cabin bag, (bought in DXB duty free) loaded into the hold, one option used by some airlines. Overall, if you strip away the slick advertising of the brand summed up as ""we are the best, (in our view) what you are left with is an economy service that includes food, IFE and cabin crew. My conclusion is very much ""buyer beware"".",Detractor

  I was flying from Perth to Colombo with Qantas but the flight from Singapore to Colombo is operated by Emirates. As soon as I got in the flight the crew was very friendly and even helped me with my hand luggage since I had a shoulder injury. Once the flight took of it was very hard to speak anyone in the crew. I even had to wait for more than 20 minutes for staff to answer the call bell. This was not the first time experienced this type of behaviour as my previous flight to Colombo from Perth via Dubai everyone in the crew had a huge attitude.,Detractor

We arrived at Dubai and had plenty of time to wander round the airport before our flight to Auckland. The A380 is a great aircraft, meals were good and again entertainment very good and the staff could not have been nicer. We have no complaints about Emirates and we will use them in future.

"  Right from ticketing counter to boarding the flight from Bangalore to San Francisco via Dubai on Emirates was the worst. Boarding at BLR airport by Emirates ground staff was an absolute mess. No announcements of gate changes or boarding by seat rows. At Dubai airport, we found out our pre-booked seats were changed and given really bad seats. When complained and talked to the Supervisor at the Emirates customer service was complete disregard to customers. On board the flight, we have pre-ordered special meals was not even acknowledged by the crew. When informed about the pre-ordered the meals, the crew rudely said they have to check their paperwork. Is that a customer issue or fault? Seats are extremely hard and uncomfortable. This is our first and last travel on Emirates.",Detractor

The meal service was high in terms of standards with a large selection of hot and cold courses. . I do recommend the Emirates A380 experience. However, the ground staff at Dubai airport were quite slow and despite the flight leaving in the off-peak time at DXB, there was still a minimal delay.",Promoter
"  Sometimes I think Emirates forget they have passengers. Beautiful aeroplanes but that's where it stops. Got an upgrade to business flying from Birmingham to Dubai but wow did we know we were not a premium flyer. No lounge, no fast track, menu was mediocre and after a 7 hour overnight flight no breakfast. Probably the worst thing though is that feedback can only happen via their forms which they don't answer. The customer service emails don't work. Overall there are more caring airlines at Cathay, Singapore or Qatar Airways. Think twice.",Detractor
"  Auckland to Sydney. What an amazing experience. My journey started off with an early check-in, quick and efficient as always and relaxation within the Lounge, well stocked with food and beverages. Upon entering I was greeted and made very welcomed, the cabin crew even walked to my suite, 1A. The features of the flight was explained to me from meal service to the famous shower facilities onboard the A380. The meal service was delicious. Privacy within your suite is great, the doors closes with a touch of a button, double shaded windows and the seat was very wide and comfortable at any position. First Class was on another level and I recommend everyone try it at least once. The cabin crew were very attentive. I will definitely fly Emirates long haul to see how consistent their service are, crew and hard product.",Promoter
"  Good journey from Manchester to Dubai. Had a 1hr 25min connection time for our flight to Bangkok. When we got to Dubai the plane seemed to take an age to park up, the pilot said that there was a slight delay as waiting for a slot. We stopped, and were bussed off: why does such a modern airport have to bus people off such a large modern aircraft? Eventually got on to our bus. Bus starts up and takes what seems like forever to get to terminal, people around us even joked that we're going straight into town, it just kept driving & driving. I've never been on a plane to terminal bus that long ever. As we got off, an airport official was asked about Bangkok flight and says 'you better run for it!' So we run for it, two adults and a child. Eventually get to the gate hot and sweaty, no time for water or coffee, & angry that we had to run. No explanation as to why we had to run for our connecting flight. We show our stuff and then try to find our way to the plane. Nobody there to help, point the way etc, we had to ask cleaners where the plane was. Got on the plane for another 6.30hrs flight hot, thirsty and angry. The staff on the plane were really nice and gave us some water. We don't fly very often, but when we do we'll think twice about flying with Emirates again.",Passive

Would not recommend flying with them as they damaged my bag, admitted it, but didn't want to resolve it.

The service on the last flights were poor especially the Johannesburg to Dubai leg, cabin staff nowhere to be seen, no water or juice offered inflight and the snack advertised a sandwich but this was also not offered and had to be asked for. The worst thing was that I had purchased the Flex fare which costs more than the saver but allows advance booking of seats. Emirates changed the aircraft a month before the flight but did not notify and the seat configuration was different meaning I was seated in a location I had not selected. Customer service was not interested and I received a poor response. I will be looking to use another airline in future.",Detractor
"  Chennai to Adelaide via Dubai. Emirates let me down. I had a lot of expectations as I frequently fly with Qatar and Etihad and based on what I heard, expected Emirates to be outstanding. Chennai-Dubai flight was outstanding! Refurbished aircraft (A6-ECL), the food was amazing, excellent legroom and crew were top class. But then came Dubai to Adelaide. I ended up flying on a old Boeing 777 (A6-EGW) which had old, unresponsive IFE (not touch screen), the crew were pretty much non-existent the whole flight. I had no legroom for that 12hr flight (I'm 6'2""). The crew did not wake me up to eat (even though I had the wake me up to eat sign up), they didn't give me my Australian immigration card. Sure, you might say they didn't want to wake me up, but they didn't even take the courtesy to put the immigration card in my seat pocket! Because of that, I had to go to Adelaide and get one at the airport security there to fill, when others just went past me. Alas, I was not the only one, they left out another 4-5 people without immigration cards too. The only thing good about Emirates is their infight meals. What I'm most surprised about is, how come a short haul flight is excellent and long haul flight a disaster? Emirates really need to get their heads together.",Passive

Inflight entertainment system with an awesome collection of movies, tv shows, music etc. The aircraft is pretty old by now and you can feel it thanks to narrow passageway, narrow seats as compared to other airlines & small lavatories. Legroom is at a premium in Economy class. Food was ordinary as my travel agent selected Hindu meal as meal preference.

And they dim the lights and to show ceiling stars. I would be amiss if I left out the professional staff that serve you.

In flight entertainment is outstanding, the flight attendants worked hard, plenty of drinks brought around. On outbound flight we were served a full meal at around 11pm, 2 hours after take off and then a light bun and tea prior to landing, it would have been more practical to serve a more substantial breakfast. I found the quality of food good, my only dissappointment with them is the charge they have implemented to choose seats, and if you're a family you may feel compelled to pay so you can sit together. However 48 hours prior to check in it is free, and I found plenty of seating available. Overall very pleased with the economy product, its a shame that european airlines cannot match the likes of Emirates and Qatar Airways on price and quality.",Promoter

Also nobody at hotel knew how and what time I'm going to be picked up in the next morning. Next morning the Hotel staff advised me to take a taxi to the airport and that the bill will be refunded by Emirates.

"  Amsterdam to Bangalore via Dubai. Until now I have always enjoyed flying Emirates. Real quality however proves itself when things go wrong. And then Emirates customer service is very low quality. On our flight to Bangalore we got delayed by more than 10 hours. First airplane was hit by lightning and had to be checked, replacement took long and when a new plane was ready and we had boarded it turned out that Bangalore airport was closed during the day due to construction works (Emirates knew this before), we had to offboard again in Dubai and wait for more than 8 hours. Except for some not too fresh rolls no help or service was provided. Customer service refused any help, for instance helping to find a hotel, a place to sleep or proper compensation. We were sent from one side of Dubai airport to another all the time. An online complaint only gets a marketing answer but no real solutions or compensation was provided. On the way back from Bangalore I had pre-booked a dietary request: Asian vegetarian. It turned out Asian vegetarian was a standard choice on this flight. By the time the trolly reached me all vegetarian meals were gone. As a vegetarian I only could chose chicken. The steward said they forgot about me and again I only could get a not too fresh roll. Again an online complaint, some vague excuses as an answer but no real compensation. So to conclude, in general Emirates is excellent, but when problems arise the services they provide are like a low cost airliner. Disappointing and I do not know if I would recommend them.",Detractor

I asked for little gifts for my children, they gave me four times (on each flight) a complete set of toys and miscellanous for kids. On the Perth section, we were only 127 passengers onboard the A380 and the flight was very pleasant, with a very fascinating InFlight Entertainment system.

"  Dusseldorf to Shanghai return via Dubai. J All in all not an excellent experience with Emirates being the leg from Shanghai to Dubai the worst. Boeing 777 aircraft in 2-3-2 configuration in Business class is clearly not matching the high expectations you have if flying with this airline. The seat on this leg was old style not fully lie flat which made this morning flight quite unpleasant. Also remarkable for me that Emirates provided only on the night flight from Dubai to Shanghai an amenity kit. The content even being from a high rated known cosmetic company is not special at all lacking ear plugs. Seen much better Kits eg. Turkish Airlines or even at Tap Portugal. In general the A380 cabin and seat better but inconsistent. Seats and plugs different on all 3 flights in A380. Seat lie flat but felt unconfortable to me as uneven. Also negatively surprised by the service level provided by the crew which was from hectic to chaotic. As noticed from others fellows in this Forum seems to be a hit or miss. Though always announced from the Cockpit ""as award winning cabin crew"" I was unfortunate and got too often the miss. Only exception was the crew on the B777 leg contrasting to the aircraft. Food always better in the lounges than on board. Highlight for me the Emirates Lounge in DÃ¼sseldorf. For me the best food offer and comfort level I had in a lounge.

"  Dubai to Lisbon, EK191 on 17th April. Was this the same airline as we flew out on? The check in staff were able to book our luggage through to our final destination (Faro) but not us! This created a bit of a problem for the TAP staff at Lisbon. On boarding the cabin crew were chatting among themselves in the galley areas and there was no-one to welcome us to our normal (47K) seat in the rear cabin. There was a noticeable tension and seemed to be a lack of teamship amongst the crew with false smiles rather than the genuine ones of the outbound crew. Continental breakfast was served but the coffee/tea forgotten - our call bell ignored and when my wife went to ask for coffees she was told ""okay but it will be cold"". After this they disappeared into the galley areas for 5 hours, occasionally rushing through the cabin but ignoring our call bell when we fancied a drink before lunch which was then served 1.5 hours before landing meaning that it was rushed - coffee and wine were being offered at the same time and they wanted to clear trays before we had even finished the main course (which to add to our dismay was tough, grisly beef). The whole service seemed to lack leadership which comes from the cabin supervisor - so if anyone from Emirates reads this I would hope they investigate.

This flight was superb from beginning with special assistance at Lisbon, on time, comfortable seats, informative flight crew, very good meal, through to special assistance at Dubai. The cabin crew were one of the the best we have come across, genuinely friendly on an a full flight, welcoming everyone onboard, regularly coming round to check that everything was alright and enquiring if we wanted more drinks and wishing all passengers a friendly farewell. Cost cutting was evident in that the seafood option has been removed as has the pre-landing snack/icecream, but the meal provided (braised beef) was tender and tasty and larger than previous.

"  Delhi to Amsterdam via Dubai. You know what to expect when you are flying with Emirates. The 777s are inconsistent in their economy class seats - some have USB ports and other have older seats. The food (AVML) is always superior and especially flying out of Dubai - actually the best plane food is served on Emirates. Seat comfort on 777 is sub-par in comparison to the economy seating in A380 which is the most comfortable I have been on in terms of leg space, seat width, recline and fittings. The quietest cabin on the lower deck on the A380 is the one at the back and yes, it does give a premium economy experience being exclusive with fewer seat rows. WiFi on board is inexpensive but can be spotty depending on the routes. IFE, of course, remains, fabulous. Cabin crew are mostly friendly - some are heartwarming and very helpful, while others forget their smile at home. All aircraft were very clean, have great in flight lightning including StarLight on the cabin ceiling (which I love) and well stocked, clean washrooms. The business class lounge in Dubai is sometimes very busy and the Concourse B one has the coveted Moet and Chandon bar which is a must visit if you have status.

I could have flown direct to Dubai to transfer for Cairo, but I cut the journey in half by changing planes in Bangkok (saved more than USD2000), although that's 6 sectors of flying in total, but all in first class, and I saved a great deal. 4 sectors were in the spacious A380 with luxurious shower bathroom, the other 2 in B777, all suites. I was served with excellent cuisine, drinks and the service was so attentive without being too intrusive. The bed was one of the most comfortable I've slept on in the sky, and the shower incredible. While I was off to my shower, my bed was made for me, with night snack of fruits and herbal tea all ready. Emirates ICE entertainment system is the best system. The privacy door is a huge bonus especially for sleeping. The vanity mirror, mini on the side etc. Excellent massage function of the seat. USD 1 for 500 MB of wifi data, every detail has been well thought of. Then there is the excellent menu and such extensive wine list! If you got the budget or mileage to upgrade, here's the way to do it to pamper yourself. I took one star off for the inconveniently closed Bangkok lounge due to renovations. A shared lounge (CIP) was used and it was very lack lustre..",Promoter
"  I made a return trip on Emirates where I had booked in first class from CDG to Colombo via Dubai returning from Lyon after a stopover in Dubai. On the return flights from CMB to DXB and DXB to LYS they made aircraft swaps (without warning and without any technical reason). They put a 2 cabins B777-300 instead of 3 cabins B777-300. So, I was downgraded twice (at different days and on different flights). I asked the refund of the difference of fares. Emirates denied it and made a refund of only 500â‚¬. As I had kept screenshots of my booking, I produced the screenshots to Emirates. Finally, Emirates refund the actual difference of fares (total of 1 000 â‚¬ as I asked). It seems that Emirates has aircraft swaps when they maybe have in mind that there are too few first class passengers booked on the involved flights.",Detractor
"  Cape Town to London via Dubai. Flew Emirates on family recommendations and to be honest they were okay but not worth the hype. The 777 with the 3-4-3 configuration is uncomfortable and cramped. Asking Â£20 per leg to select seats is robbery when you are only transiting from one aircraft to another. that would have added Â£160 to the price of 2 return tickets. The crew were indifferent and did not really communicate with you, they were distant, I asked for a drink with my meal which never arrived and part of my meal tray was missing but by then I had given up. They seemed disorganised at service times. On 4 flights only had one 'comfort' bag with socks, eye mask and toothbrush in. The A380 was a much nicer aircraft and reasonably comfortable and we did have a spare seat next to us. Food was again okay. Overall pay a bit more and go Qatar Airways.",Detractor

"  Dublin to Tokyo via Dubai. I secured a real bargain rate for a first class ticket. I did not see any evidence of cost cutting throughout the experience. Standards were high and the crews encountered displayed a high level of motivation. We still have the Boeing 777 as the only option from Dublin but they were all in superb condition. Plenty of complementary goodies for the ladies and as much food and drink you fancied at the click of the galley button. The Dubai stopovers were well organised and a really good room at Le Meridien was provided, along with copious food and beverage vouchers. The Timeless spa concession at the 1st class lounge I found to be a white elephant, unable to get an appointment and they did not mention this is only available at the main concourse B, after the long walk to concourse C. The only downside was not Emirates fault. A long reroute from Tokyo because of the tensions in the area and 11 hrs of heavy turbulance with the crew struggling even with the basics. All in all couldn't fault them given the culture of cut everything to the bone by some airlines at the moment.",Promoter

The local airport personnel was rude and unprofessional. Coming to Seychelles we had more then one piece of hand luggage, but leaving Seychelles they insisted on Emirates rules of single piece of hand luggage at 7.5 kilos max. The Emirates representative was absolutely helpless. When I offered to pay extra for 2 kilos of hand luggage she just said there is no such option and she cannot help. Emirates do not respect their customers. The rules that are enforced are very inconsistent and depending on your departure airport, but in Seychelles I was told that they do follow the rules while at other places probably not.",Detractor
"  Gatwick to Islamabad via Dubai. Overall it was ok experience but I was expecting more from Emirates. I booked this flight six months ago and was travelling with infant so I had already selected bulkhead seats at the front of both legs of my journey. However, Emirates decided to change my seats two weeks before from 8A to 38D on DXB-ISB route making me furious. Upon calling them I was given the usual answer that the aircraft was changed which was a blatant lie as it was the same aircraft. Emirates need to honour the commitments they make as it was a nightmare with an infant moving right back in the aircraft so all the hypes of portraying itself as a family friendly airline was proved wrong. On the other hand IFE was great but food lacked taste and variety.",Passive

However in Dubai the business class lounge was like you had arrived at the bus depot - big and impersonal. The staff was stoic and looked as if they would rather be anywhere but where they were. This is the second time while travelling business class the crew has informed me that they are running short on the main entree and I could not have the food at s later time as they were warming all the food together. The food which came looked unappealing and dry. I will try my best not to travel emirates again. It's become impersonal and now have an I don't care attitude.,Passive

I wasn't told it was Emirates policy that they assess every passenger's hand luggage including items bought at the airport before you board the plane. The 7kg allowance prior to departure in London was more due to my duty-free shopping. I was told by the ground floor supervisor/manager that I have to reduce the weight of my hand luggage or pay $200 for extra weight or return my duty-free shopping but I refused to do so.

"  Starting with the best part: one of the reasons we selected Emirates is that they fly the A380 on all legs of our journey from Amsterdam to Bangkok via Dubai. The whole upper deck of Emirates A380 is Business class. The seats are configured 1-2-1. You can make a 180 degrees bed from it, there's a huge screen, a separate tablet (no idea why) and a mini bar with some drinks on it. Lots of space for everything. In the back there's a bar with lots of delicious small things to eat and a good reason to leave your chair from time to time, even if you do not normally visit bars. The A380 is super silent. We flew Business Class on a Qatar 787 earlier and the noise level of the 787 is so much higher than that of the Airbus. The A380 is the best plane we have flown, unbelievable that they have struggled for orders. Emirates has more: free limousine service up to 65 km, in comfortable cars and all well arranged. Lounges in Dubai and Bangkok offer great food and other facilities like a shower, the Schiphol lounge in contrast has just a few things to eat. But Emirates has drawbacks too. Vegetarian meals in business class are very poor. One of our meals mainly consisted of two salads of the type ""what are the cheapest ingredients we can find"". Why not serve what they serve in their lounges? The best Business Class meals so far were from KLM. No A380's but well thought about vegetarian meals. Also we phoned if they could combine vegetarian and gluten free. That could be arranged but it wasn't. They can't. On a business class ticket with a list price of multiple 1000's euros. And it really is not so difficult. Qatar could do it. Qatar also serves the meal when you want - Emirates serves the meal shortly after you enjoyed the Dubai lounge buffet. Two more drawbacks: when we complained the reply was something like ""Sorry you didn't like it but Emirates serves the best food in the airline industry"". So they can't serve nice vegetarian meals and on top of that they don't take complaints seriously. What I also disliked is that the entertainment system (which in itself is the best we have ever seen, title wise) displays news messages on all selection screens. Why would I want that? I am on holiday and don't want to read news. But it can't be switched off.",Promoter
"  My recent flight from Taipei to London via Dubai was thoroughly enjoyable, both night and daylight flights. Taipei to Dubai sector was full yet the crew managed to address passengers by name and were attentive. I love the onboard bar and despite full capacity, was rather empty, with most snuggled up to sleep. It was a 4 hour connection to London at Dubai. Even though the Dubai lounge with its facilities for relaxing, sleeping or dining, I had to wait 45 minutes for a shower to be available. However, I was refreshed for my flight back to London, the service was impeccable. Even after a Venison main course and cheese board lunch, the crew were inviting me to the bar for more snacks. I have noticed that the A380s on the Taipei-Dubai, Hong Kong-Dubai and Singapore-Dubai flights are newer seating than the London-Dubai A380s. My one small beef about Emirates Business Class is the seat itself. It must be narrowest - just an inch wider than the Economy I think. I am small, but I find it still too narrow compared to other airline seats which are 20-22 inches wide. One passenger I spoke to said he could not get any sleep and felt claustrophobic. I guess seat width has been sacrificed to include the clutter of the Mini Bar and Tablet (I've never seen anyone use the Tablet). Overall Emirates for me is good value, and cheaper than flying direct to Asian destinations, and I enjoy the break in Dubai anyway.",Promoter

IFE probably the best in the sky and on a decent sized screen too. From Dubai to Jakarta was a much older plane with smaller screens but attendants just as nice. What let this airline down was the food. First flight they had only chicken left when they got to me so even though I was hungry I declined but imagine my surprise when later I saw the cabin crew tucking into the ""left over beef meals"" including the stewardess who had served me. On the second flight I was served what is probably the worst beef meal I have ever witnessed on a plane so again nothing to eat.

Customer Services staff passed me from one person to another, eventually discovered that my ticket was blocked so couldn't get a refund until that was listed. No response from UK office, just not interested - and indeed if I had rebooked with Emirates I would have been charged an additional Â£200 but if you are taken ill and spend days in hospital Emirates charges you Â£213.

"  Los Angeles to Delhi via Dubai. We have flown Emirates several times to visit family in India. However, in December 2016, an issue arose with our plane during take off. Unfortunately, it all went downhill from there. They kept us on the plane at the gate for 3 hours. They fed us dinner and right after we were told to exit the plane. We knew we wouldn't be taking off that night, so having us sit in the gate area would've allowed for more comfort and food options. After those 3 hours, we stood in a line for 3 hours to get a hotel voucher since the next flight we could be on was not until Friday morning (it was 1am Wed Night at this point) and did not live close to the airport. We obtained the hotel voucher and headed to our hotel, only to be returned because the hotel was full and said the airline didn't call them to approve the availability. Needless to say, we didn't get to a hotel until 5am. We were put in a hotel 12 miles away and were told we could get refunded for the Uber, but it's been 2 months since the receipt was submitted and still have not received the $58 back. Flight Friday was delayed again by about 5 hours, so we missed our connection and had to stay in Dubai a night since there were no open flights. So we missed 4 days of our trip. The cabin is nice, clean and updated. The food is usually pretty good for airplane food! There is good pitch between seats and good seat width. On our trip back though, our seat cushions were pretty poor in quality and rather uncomfortable/hard to sit on. I would fly again, but seeing how they recently changed their ""saver"" rates to where you cannot choose your seat until check-in, we are looking for another airline. For such long flights, it would be nice to have peace of mind that your family will be sitting together.",Passive
"  Singapore to Melbourne. Before boarding I was paged to see the ground staff which I did and was asked by a rude staff if I could change my exit row seat for another passenger wishing to seat as a couple. I said no. Then during the messy boarding process I was refused boarding and directed to go back to the counter to see another ground staff, I was made to wait and treated as if I had done something wrong. The staff later took my boarding pass with an annoyed look clicked on her computer and handed back to me without a word. No explanation, no apology nothing such rudeness in the way they treat passengers. On boarding the aircraft witness an angry passenger who wanted my seat apparently and made a fuss to the cabin crew and chief Steward. She was a lone passenger so it appears that the ground crew lied about a couple wanting to sit together. Why should I be inconvenienced at the expense of others - am I not a passenger worthy of some dignity and respect? The service on this flight was at best sloppy and the crew seemed unpolished. Some were though to be fair so forgivable. But after the main course served the crew disappeared until time for a small second meal prior to landing which was a cold muffin and cold roll for breakfast - really bad! No orange juice, the crew just said don't have and that was it. No water runs between meals. Before landing crew collected the blankets and started to drag them around passengers and dumped into the toilets! Overall an average mediocre flight, crew service not very professional.

"  Dubai to Manchester. Boarded the plane at the last minute owing to delayed previous flight. The cabin crew walked past me three times without offering a drink although on each occasion she had a tray full of drinks. I did eventually get a drink but only after I specifically asked for one. A380 seats for me are uncomfortable and claustrophobic. Cabin crew service was poor and disjointed with the majority of business class crew spending more time in the bar area chatting, at times outnumbering the passengers there. The main meal was very good although the wine service was poor. Again, the chocolates mentioned in the menu were absent as was ant offer of coffee after the meal. In flight entertainment was good. This was the sixth flight on business class with Emirates within four months and each time I have been very disappointed with the product. Service on the A380 seems to be very poor.",Passive

During the delay we were asked what we wanted for a meal, both first and second choices were unavailable. Eventually I ended up having the lunch instead of breakfast which meant that there was not much choice for lunch. Cabin crew service was hit and miss. Seat comfort was acceptable and far better than those on the A380. No amenity packs were offered. Arriving at Dubai late we had 20 minutes to catch the connecting flight which entailed using the rail link and with faulty lifts in the terminal we just made the connection.

"  I have been taking Emirates service between Bangkok and Hong Kong a few times a year for more than 6 years. Little has changed (although on the more recent A380s there is unfortunately no side pocket for books, iPads etc.), the meals and wines remain very good, the bar at the back is excellent, service is efficient and the lounge offerings better than most airlines. Plus I love the aircraft. But I have to bring up two issues. The IFE Guide used to be user-friendly. Now the airline has jazzed it up, it is a design mess and extremely difficult to read! Movies have no timings. What is the point of that, especially for short flights? To find out timings you have to open each channel and wade through ads each time. So if you are considering which of 4 or 5 movies to select you waste a lot of time and patience with the added possibility you'll miss the end of the movie before landing. Then there are the audio programmes. Once again the classical music section used to be hugely comprehensive. Now it is another mess. What is the point of having a composer's name as the title of a channel - like just Mendelssohn or Mozart - when the works being performed are not listed? Do we have to check the screen every time? If so, then even that often does not provide the information. Wagner wrote operas and so is understandably included in the Opera section (although with no works listed). Yet he also appears in the non-operatic section. To find out what that included, I started the channel. Nothing on the screen gave me any clue what was about to be played. Never mentioned anywhere is the fact it is the opera Das Rheingold - almost two and a half hours non-stop music and singing! No indication either of artists, conductors and orchestras, all of interest to those listening. Something really has to be done to include more pertinent accurate detail in the Guide. My other disappointment was having foregone the meal and watched a movie, when it was over I went to the bar to get some canapÃ©s. As I went to the nearby toilet to wash my hands, there were plenty available. Less than 45 seconds later, everything had been dumped into the trash bins - even though there were still 35 minutes of the flight remaining and drinks were still being served. Surely you don't get rid of bar offerings so quickly - at least until the descent has started!",Passive
"  Hong Kong to Dubai. They blocked seats so when I tried to check in online 48hr before, I was stuck in the seat they assigned me. We were a family of four travelling together. We were separated in the huge A380. I cannot move our family to sit together or even close by. I called the customer service, and also raised my concern with their social media team, the feedback I got was that all passengers had already checked in by then - which was ridiculous. And they refused to help. Their staff told me, in a quite rude way, that I should've paid a lot more for a better cabin. Second, on the flight from Dubai to Hong Kong, they ran out of food (food, not food selection) when the trolly reached me. I asked why this happened since there was fixed number of passengers/seats on board, and the flight attendant, at first, said that this should be expected by passengers, and asked if I wanted to have cup noodle instead. Until later she said that was a mistake. She then offered me one sandwich and said to me that it supposed to be staff's meal but I can take it (any staff will have no meal during the flight?) I refused. Later on when they started to collect left-overs, miraculously, the flight attendant 'found' one meal and wanted to offer to me. This is disgusting.

"  To me, Emirates hasn't changed much since my last trip with them in 2013. It still offers free train ticket (in Germany) that connects your home to the airport. Flights from Munich to Beijing via Dubai were on-time. Onboard service was great with a good selection of food and alcoholic/non-alcoholic drinks. I went for some vodka and they served me Russian Standard, a premium vodka distilled in St. Petersburg. That was a pleasant surprise. The only downside of the trip was Munich airport. Emirates uses Munich's Terminal 1, which is very outdated and small, especially so when being compared to Munich airport's new Terminal 2. On our way back, at Munich there were only 3 immigration windows and a small luggage carousel for the 500 passengers from a fully packed A380.",Promoter
"  Larnaca to Malta. This is the only way to get to Malta from Cyprus and it isn't a bad option. Bought a coach ticket and a few days before EK sent an email for an upgrade to Business for Euro 320. One-way business fare is Euro 800 so I thought what the heck - I'll do it. You get neither the car service pick-up nor access to the business class lounge - it's stated when you buy the upgrade - but I think I wouldn't do it again as it's totally ridiculous not to give you lounge access. Check-in was friendly and flight boarded on-time. They use the 7-across business Boeing 777-300ER for this route which is false advertising as the upgrade email said lie-flat seats in private all aisle-access seating. But I had the seat next to me free and enjoyed the space. ICE is always the best of any airline so can't fault entertainment system. Service - the key point - was the downfall. The FA serving my side was lacking much personality, hard to get her to smile but I did manage it once. The male FA was mostly flirting with the lady passengers behind me and not until we lifted off did he come by and introduce himself. Food was average - had the same in coach on other airlines. Cabin was clean and again seat was comfortable for the 2 1/2 hour trip. Landed on time but priority bags came out last - which was a pain as I had a car waiting for over an hour after I landed.

Their consolation round trip tickets are all well and good except I don't have any time off of work to travel again, and we really can't afford another vacation.

  Flew Emirates from Dubai to London Heathrow. Four hour delay before take-off due to a technical problem only apparent after we had taxied to the runway for take-off. Food service offered but never materialised. Child meals later provided were unhealthy and inedible.

The flight deck reminding them that we were at 10000 feet and they really ought to be sitting down.

Ran out of meal choice of Lamb and crew looked disinterested. Was not looking forward to second leg of the journey. When my wife and I checked in they could not confirm that we would be sitting together on the second leg even though we had booked six months ago. Then it all changed, when a very helpful gent at the Emirates counter sorted us out with new boarding passes. It was the game changer for us.

"  Newcastle to Bahrain via Dubai. I have made 5 trips with Emirates in the last 15 months, made up of 20 flights. There has been a steady decline in quality and the service provided. It seems that Emirates is becoming a budget hub operator. The prices have stayed the similar, however with saver fares you must pay to select your seat before check in. This wouldn't be too bad, but Emirates don't allow the purchase of exit seats which is bad compared to other carriers. The choice of drinks onboard has decreased and certain routes have had snacks removed, which existed before. It seems the cabin crew are not as courteous as I first experienced and even seem slightly unprofessional. My biggest complaint is that they cancelled one of my flights, gave me an alternative that got me to my destination 24 hours late. After calling them they changed it to the earlier flight meaning I'd make my connection. The way they came across on the phone was that I should be grateful they changed it for free. Now I had a long connection in Dubai and asked for lounge access as a form of compensation, which they refused. They said waiving the cost of changing my flight was my compensation. Changing the flight in the first place was their fault. Also, when I landed in Bahrain it took nearly an hour and half for my luggage and there was still half the passengers waiting when I left. Overall, a budget choice if you have no other option. Emirates is very much a last option for myself now.",Detractor

"  London Heathrow to Dubai. The service we received today was appalling. This is the second time we have flown with this airline and the service has been consistently poor. First of all the staff took over an hour for the trays to be cleared leaving us highly uncomfortable in our seats. The hostess snapped at me when I asked for the trays to be cleared reporting that she has 400 passengers to cater for. Another staff snapped and told us we should wait when we requested for juice to eat our meal which was served an hour after everyone had eaten, as our preferred choice had .",Detractor
"  Again, a highly enjoyable flight with Emirates from Dubai to Zurich. The ground staff in Dubai was very helpful and super efficient. Boarding was very punctual and well organised. Warm welcome from the excellent cabin crew when I boarded and throughout the flight the cabin crew was just lovely and very attentive. Seats on the A380 are so comfortable and the IFE is just brilliant. There was just not enough time to watch all the new releases. The food was absolutely delicious (I had salmon and saffron rice), the service impeccable and the flight overall just amazing. Emirates is just the best airline I have flown with and I am looking forward to my next trip with them later in the year.",Promoter

"  Dubai from Islamabad, I couldn't have tea because milk was not available. The food was tasteless. The trip back to Islamabad from Dubai was worse. After reminding the steward that I wanted eyeshades twice, I never got them! After landing in Islamabad, the next day I used Emirates online complaint system and wrote them a detailed picture of what happened. I get an email from Emirates in which I was addressed by a wrong name, indicating that the whole complaint reply process just involved cut and paste functions. Reply was ""we do appreciate you bringing this matter to our attention. Please accept my apologies for not having met your expectations",Detractor
"  Brisbane to London Gatwick via Dubai, and a much better trip back. Clean aircraft and pleasant FAs. Particularly like that the entertainment system is working as soon as you enter the plane. Plenty of hot towels throughout the flights. Downside would be the soups which were served either lukewarm or cold and the showers within the A lounge, which were dirty with mould staining. Highlight was the fish starter. However no waiting for the facility this time. Also found the quiet seating area. Chauffeur service very efficient and no delays on either flight despite late departures from both airports.",Promoter
"  Warsaw to Hanoi via Dubai. There was a significance difference in the quality of service between the 2 flights. The mainly Polish crew on the Warsaw to Dubai leg were quite abrupt and rude. The chief purser seemed very stressed and the crew did not seem professional at all. The TV screens were also quite old and not very responsive. The Dubai to Hanoi leg was much better. We had more comfortable seats towards the rear of the plane and the crew were excellent. Especially, the Brazilian flight attendant who saw we were trying to take a selfie and kindly offered to take the photo herself. Her colleague even went and pulled down all the window blinds in the last few rows to make the photo clearer. I was seriously impressed with this level of attentiveness. So overall, Emirates is a bit of a mixed bag in terms of the quality of the staff. Some are amazing, others mediocre at best - and some downright rude.",Passive
"  Dubai to Manila. I am a first time Emirates passenger. Boarding process was disorganized. Flight attendants seemed tired and never smiled. Even if I said thank you, not even a single response, just nothing. There was no amenity kit given to Economy passengers. Food was so-so. Onboard announcements before take off and landing was rushed. I am not happy with my first time with them but I have a return flight to Dubai with Emirates and I hope it will be a better experience from the first one.",Detractor
"  Rome to Dubai. Very pleasant flight with A380. Check-in counters open more than 3h before flight, DXB offers an early check-in block counters. Fast boarding . The cabin crew on both flights were friendly as professional. A complimentary play kit was provided to the child. Our seats in both flights were on row 44 (economy starts at row 41) so we were in front of engines allowing a very quite and comfortable flight. Entertaining system boasts loads of movies, music, video and other information (also 3 real cameras). Meals were served prior to children and other special requests menu. Tea, coffee, juices, etc, never lacking. 6hr flight were spent pleasantly thanks to the cabin arrangements, ICE entertainment and spacious seat legroom. Overall, a fantastic experience.",Promoter
"  Christchurch to Sydney. After our Qantas flight was cancelled we ended up at the Emirates desk being checked in for EK413 to Sydney the check in assistant was very empathetic after our traumatic experience. We have flown Emirates before and had reservations which had led us to avoid them for this trip to New Zealand. Unfortunately even though they were very good to accommodate us the same problems resurfaced. The plane was brilliant, newer than the one we flew on in 2014 with a brilliant seat and inflight entertainment. The main problem is with the service and staff. Business class was no more than two thirds full but we were told that our meal selection was unavailable. When I informed the attendant that I did not eat either of the alternatives she said she would see what she could do. Her solution was to give me an economy main course, and not having enough food to fulfil all requests is unacceptable. The staff seemed disorganised and some had a poor grasp of English. My wife and I asked two simple questions of the attendants, one did not know and the other did not understand and had to get a senior. I did not have a dedicated attendAnt for sake of continuity and was served by 4 different people. No hot drinks were served after the meal. If you are paying a business class fare you expect value for money. I know we were transferred at short notice but by taking us we were still entitled to expect certain standards.",Detractor
"  Glasgow to Bangkok return via Dubai with Emirates. Reasonable check in, in both Glasgow and Bangkok. All flights arrived pretty much on time, even if late in departing. Usual variable cabin crew with BKK routes so-so, but much more attentive crews on the Glasgow legs. Economy class food seems to be improving in recent years though I think the IFE choice of films is not as good as it was. No remote stand bussing in DXB which is an improvement. Good availability of flights and good prices which are the main reasons I choose Emirates, though they are now charging Â£20 per leg to preselect seats in advance of the 48hr online check-in window which I find ridiculous.",Passive
"  Paris to Melbourne via Dubai. Economy class is never going to be that comfortable, but the A380 from Paris to Dubai was okay and felt quite spacious. Changed onto a Boeing 777 in Dubai for the 13.5 hour flight to Melbourne - ouch! This aircraft was so cramped, width of seat excruciating and has put me off every choosing Emirates again. The fare was cheap and now I know why! Entertainment onboard was good, but couldn't distract from the pain and discomfort. To anyone thinking of Emirates on this Melbourne route, think again and choose another airline.",Detractor
"  Dubai to Beijing in business class, and what a mistake. I could have routed through Doha or Abu Dhabi, but Emirates was a little cheaper for business class and now I know why. The Boeing 777 had seats in this cabin arranged 2x3x2, and being in the middle block I couldn't believe how cramped, uncomfortable and positively horrible this is. One expects this from premium economy, but not business. The IFE was okay, but I had expected something much more and realised they bulk up the quantity by many multi national offerings and a plethora of old (not proper classic) movies that other airlines wouldn't bother with. The cabin staff performed their duties, not with any friendliness or courtesy, and I'm glad my return route flights are arranged with China Southern who at least offer proper flat bed seats and comfort in business class. Never again via Dubai with Emirates.",Detractor
"  Zurich to Muscat via Dubai. From smooth check-in in Zurich through to transit in Dubai and a short connecting flight to Muscat, where we were served a snack and coffee / tea on a 35 minute flight, everything was perfect. The meal from Zurich to Dubai was delicious. I had ordered beef and it was tender and tasty. The cabin crew on both flights were very friendly, attentive and helpful. My seat on the A380 was very comfortable and inflight entertainment kept me entertained. On the flight from Dubai to Muscat I was seated at the aisle and even though the Boeing 777-300 has a 3-4-3 seating it did not feel crammed for me. Overall, a fantastic experience.",Promoter
"  Brisbane to Auckland return with Emirates in business class. From check-in, the flight crew, food and drink selection, seat comfort and inflight entertainment selection, the experience was 10 out of 10! I was seated in the upper deck of the A380 both ways, which can be an advantage. I look forward to a longer flight (Europe), with Emirates in the future. Keep up the good work!",Promoter
"  London to Dubai, my first experience with Emirates and I went in with some high expectations. At Heathrow we checked-in 3 hours in advance and it was very easy, however the staff didn't seem that engaging with the customer or enthusiastic, so I felt a bit dissatisfied. Check-in at the gate was also speedy considering the size of the aircraft. You get your passport checked before being called in for boarding. Again similar experience with the staff - no eye contact, no smile, and very low voice. Boarding was well managed, my seat was on row 83. Very pleased with the seat size, legroom and overall cabin space. I consider myself to have long legs (183cm height) Food was excellent, metal cutlery and little details like chocolate and small snacks complement the meal well. The red wine was a highlight for me. Overall cabin experience was excellent including entertainment.",Promoter
"  Gatwick to Perth via Dubai. Emirates do not care and customer service is a joke. I received a bland apology and they flatly denied I was booked in as vegetarian, something which I double checked as I booked through an agent. Unfortunately I was served vegan food, which was appalling. They tried to serve the same dreadful dishes twice on the same trip. Not the gourmet food promised on their website. The cabin crew did their best to rustle up something edible, but when I finally was served a vegetarian meal on the last flight of the trip - a meal which had been rejected by another passenger - it was a very hot, spicy chick pea meal with a raw chilli in it. Not everyone reacts well to hot spicy food and I am one of them. Dubai Airport is a disgrace - the customer service staff were surly and unhelpful. I was not advised that there was a business lounge nearer to my boarding gate, (the gate number was on the pass, so that would not have been difficult) resulting in a long, last minute dash to the gate. On the return flight, finding the correct lounge was nigh impossible, and I and another passenger had to ask a cleaner as no customer service staff were anywhere to be seen. The signage was inadequate. As for the Fast Track passes handed out on both the flights, these were meaningless and we were herded through with the rest of the passengers. A 15 minute (at least) bus ride from the plane to the terminal was the last straw. To summarise I paid three times the economy price for a lie flat bed and a few glasses of champagne. Not the exciting, wonderful experience promised by Emirates, and they are so big they really do not care.",Detractor
"  A family trip from Jakarta to Jeddah via Dubai. Seat was okay while In-flight Entertainment was various. The screen from Jakarta to Dubai was more interactive as it was a newer type of screen, depends on which aircraft one'll fly with. Food had a middle-eastern style taste and it was unexpectedly good. Wi-Fi was available, but didn't check it out. On the other hand, staffs were curt. The use of ""please"" from staffs can be increased. On the bright side, everyone still did their job. In a nutshell, hospitality can be enhanced.",Passive
"  Due to heavy fog at Gatwick on 23rd January I was unable to arrive into Gatwick from Copenhagen to make it to my Emirates flight. Most flights were delayed 7-8 hours on arrival in Gatwick. I explained this to Emirates without luck. Gatwick only had departures and not arrivals from 6am to 2pm that day. Emirates refused to put me on the next flight despite explaining that it was not my fault. As a result I lost 500 Euros and had to go back to Copenhagen, and my hotel bookings were lost. Holidays ruined by Emirates are not humane and they do not care about you!",Detractor
"  Very pleasant trip from Yangon to Manchester via Dubai. Pleased to see that there is a business class lounge in Yangon, shared with other airlines, as this is not mentioned on Emirates website. The lounge was very comfortable though with very limited food post-midnight. The cabin crew were very helpful on both legs of the journey and provided much better service on both legs than on recent trips. In particular, they accommodated a small bamboo stool (souvenir) that was marginally over the luggage dimensions though fitted OK into the larger overhead lockers (ground staff wanted to put it in the hold). They also greeted me by name on the DXB-MAN flight and offered to show me how all the seat / screen controls worked. The seats were very comfy on both the new Boeing 777 (RGN-DXB) and the older A380 (DXB-MAN). I asked to change my breakfast from Express to Continental and the cabin crew agreed immediately. The food is never exceptional on Emirates but it was tasty. The New Zealand Pinot Noir wine was excellent. The cabin crew were very attentive in bringing and removing towels / food and drink. I didn't manage to connect to wifi, though this sometimes depends which country we are over.",Promoter
"  Emirates was simply brilliant. I flew four flights with them in a week, London Heathrow to Mumbai via Dubai, returning from Delhi to London via Dubai, and all flights were perfect. The sector DEL to DXB was delayed as Delhi airport authorities decided to shut the airport for an hour due to national day preparations so we sat there for an hour meaning that the time at Dubai for connecting my onward flight was minimal. However Emirates pulled it out of the bag and I made my connecting flight and my bags were there at Heathrow as well! Despite flying economy my seat was comfortable with plenty of legroom, the entertainment was superb with thousands of films and TV programmes to watch and the food was fine. The flight attendants were friendly and efficient, especially those from Europe and South East Asia. I have no hesitation in flying with Emirates again.",Promoter
"  Cape Town to Sydney via Dubai. Emirates has to be the worst airline I have ever travelled with. They state on your ticket that you are allowed 30kg of checked in baggage. However, when you check in this changes to two 23kg bags. Now because most passengers are over 23kg and are not in a position to buy a new bag at the airport, they let you ""get out"" of the dilemma by paying $75 (USA). Most passengers I met on board stated they had to pay this amount. When myself and the other passengers inquired about this amount to ground staff, we were all rudely told ""you need to read the fine print and that it a new Emirates policy"". I was also shouted at by the senior manager in Cape Town because I asked him to explain why this policy was in place. After we argued for almost 30 mins, he turned to the other ground staff and started laughing. They also ran out of food and I had to miss dinner despite paying for this service. Staff on board also don't seem to like their job as they don't respond to the assistance light and frequently forget what they told you. As a frequent traveller to all parts of the world, this is the worst airline I have ever flown. Emirates has become an arrogant airline which now seems to accept bad service and rude staff. I will never travel with them ever again.",Detractor
"  Gatwick to Brisbane via Dubai. Travelled on the evening flight from the UK, transitting Dubai mid morning with the Brisbane leg being a night flight. Good points - prompt chauffer service at both ends, good lounge at Gatwick with reasonable range of food, wide range of films and the entertainment system is available as soon as you board, heated towels at regular intervals, comfy seating with mattress topper for sleep, fast track security pass. Negatives - patchy on board service, untidy and tired looking plane on the Brisbane leg, lack of sleep suits. Major problem was the transfer at Dubai. Gatwick flight's arrival into Terminal A was delayed by over an hour due to fog. We then found that the Brisbane flight was leaving from Terminal B, a train ride away where the Business Lounge is much poorer than in A. Due to restricted time for transfer my wife did not use the shower facility, the gents was ok but tiny cubicle. Went to the Boarding Gate on time but plane was parked off stand on the other side of the airport. Bus transfer needed and chaos seemed to ensue. We were at least an hour in the lounge/queuing on the stairs - not acceptable for business customers. Plane was then delayed leaving Dubai and arrived at Brisbane about 2 hours late. This created issues with our ongoing transfer. We are hoping that our return to the UK in Feb will not suffer the same delays.",Passive
"  Savannah to Cochin via New York JFK and Dubai. Emirates has collaborated with Jetblue to allow seamless transitions between continents. However, the Emirates website was not updated to include the courtesy layover package (visa on arrival / hotel) for the 14 hours we were forced to stay in the airport, waiting for our connection. We tried a lot to reason with the online customer service and ground staff but they refused to work around the issue. We were travelling with a 1 year old and it was a miserable 14 hours. After the long wait in the terminal, we had to board a 13 hour flight to New York which unnecessarily made our travel very hectic. There was an earlier flight to New York but ground staff refused. They were rude and belittling, likely due to lack of sensitivity training. They spoke broken English and got aggravated when asked to repeat. We expected them to take responsibility for the website flaw and treat our family with respect.",Detractor

"  Pure nightmare. I travelled with a 4yrs old who has special needs. I was allocated a seat in the upper deck which is close to business class. My seat was changed a few minutes before boarding with this unbelievable reason â€œyour child has autism so he can't seat near the business areaâ€! We were then moved to the lower deck to the end of the plane (from 27 to 87) where we could enjoy the toilet flushing sound throughout the 7hrs flight from Dubai to Birmingham. Not only that I was relying on my son's pushchair as he gets tired walking long distance. They lost the first pushchair on the way to Dubai, texted me the next day and asked me to collect it, had to take taxi from Sharjah to Dubai, waited in the lost luggage office for hours to be told the text message was wrong and they haven't yet found the pushchair. Ok, organized another pushchair and this was again lost on the way back to Birmingham. I have been calling their call center for the last 10 days, every time talked to a new person but same reply, â€œwe will email Birmingham airport, they will get back to youâ€! So far nothing has happened and I had to buy a new pushchair for my son.",Detractor
"  Bangkok to Dubai. I was worried about some of the negative reviews about Emirates at first. Fortunately, my new year's eve flight was one of the best I've ever had in years. Very friendly, hard-working and charming team of international crew, a medium load, free wifi for 10 mb, or only USD1 for 500 mb, all made for a great journey. Catering standard was better than average, a great choice of drinks and wine etc. The bar at the back of the upper deck is a must do. A lot of passengers went to sleep, I was having fun with the crew counting down to the new year, a first for me on the air! If ever there was one minor imperfection, that would be the dining table of my seat, which was badly designed in a way, when opened and folded down, it cuts almost into my stomach (I am stocky). Dining was not exactly comfortable with this fatal design fault. I took one mark off because of that. Otherwise, it's a perfect 10 from me.",Promoter
"  Hyderabad to London via Dubai. After being advised that I could change my flight for my return journey, I managed to find a flight earlier and tried to pay for the ticket using my UK card, (for which I got charged for a failed transaction), Two credit cards from India and failed. There was money in the accounts but they couldn't take the money. I was advised to bring in cash to the airport on the day of travel. So I painstakingly managed to get 20,000 Rupees when currency was scarce in India and took it to the airport. The rude woman over the phone at the airport Emirates office just said she couldn't take my money because the call centre people didn't put the amount to pay on the ticket but it was confirmed conditionally? Didn't get that logic at all. So I had to call the call centre after putting some more credit as the average call time for a call to Emirates is a minimum of half an hour to an hour. Then the manager comes on the phone and directs me to someone else in the airport. I was due to fly at 9:20pm and hadn't paid for my ticket until 7:15 pm. I was scared to death as I had to report to work the next day. The casual and careless attitude of the Emirates airport staff didn't help relieve the tension. Somehow after going through so many people and so many phone calls I have finally managed to pay for my ticket and nearly didn't get my change if I didn't impose on it. It has been an absolute nightmare journey with Emirates.",Detractor
"  My flight from Dublin to Hong Kong via Dubai was pleasant. The flight is good value for money, cheaper than flights that I used to go on that connect through Heathrow. I felt the service was standard and comparable to other airlines I have flown long haul. The journey is split into two 8 hours flights with a layover between. Due to the timing of the dinner and breakfast service, getting a long period of rest was difficult. They were slow to turn off the cabin lights to allow passengers to rest. In the past when I went through Heathrow I felt the crew were quicker to serve the first meal and served the last meal much closer to landing, maximising the rest period. And they were quicker to turn off lights. In my second leg from Dubai to Hong Kong, a child had vomited at the back of the plane by the lavatory. The crew seemed to struggle to come up with a way to deal with it but they improvised in the end. I would have thought vomit on the floor would have been something they had a procedure for.",Passive

"  Seattle to Thiruvananthapuram via Dubai. I was travelling with my kids, which includes an infant. The staff on the flight from Seattle to Dubai were rude and non-cooperative. I requested for warm water to prepare some food for my kid and it was provided after 2 hrs even after me telling them in the first place that it is for the infant's meal. At the airport just before boarding they made a fuss about my one cabin baggage being 8 kg and wanted me to move the 1 kg to another bag even though the total weight of the baggage's were less than the allowed weight limit for 3 people. I had requested special meals due to some dietary requirements. The tray was provided well before the meal was served to rest of the passengers. With a one year old how many hours can I handle the tray? On requesting the crew member to help me out by taking the tray the response was we cannot do it as we are serving other passengers. All of them responded in a very arrogant manner. The passenger who was sitting on the aisle seat was so accommodating that he agreed to switch seats with me seeing my plight. I had to go to the kitchen area to get warm water every single time with my little one. The screen in-front of my seat was not working. I just wanted it to be switched off. The crew member said it will be done in 5 minutes and that he will be back in 5 minutes. Apparently he came after 5 hrs. The airlines says that they take care of people who are travelling with kids which is not true. The other passengers (elder people) were so kind that they offered to hold the baby for a few minutes so that I can use the restroom. On our return flight, I had requested for gluten-free meal which was provided in the flight from TRV to Dubai but was denied on the flight from Dubai to Seattle stating that I had not made the choice, even though i had opted for it in all the flights to and fro. I do want to thank the crew on the flight from Dubai to Thiruvananthapuram who were helpful and accommodating. They helped me out without even requesting. They took care of the baby so that I could use the restroom and also made sure that the passengers travelling with kids had a comfortable pleasant flight.",Detractor
"  It would seem to me that Emirates have spent all their money on advertising and celeb associations while overlooking the upkeeping of their planes or training their staff. My return flight London to Melbourne was one of the worst flight related experiences I've been through and a huge disappointment. One half of the entertainment screen on the first leg of the journey (LHR to DXB) was unresponsive so I gave up on trying to watch anything. The provided headphones are awful, and you can't use you own because of the archaic two ports stereo jack they work with. The food was simply awful on 4 of the 5 flight legs on my journey. Apart from the crackers and cheese, I ate next to nothing. Airport staff are incredibly slow at doing anything. Just one example: boarding our connecting flight in Singapore, they chose to guide all the 800 or so passengers onto the plane by having a junior member of staff hold boards with the boarding zones up. If you haven't been in the Singapore airport before, you'll probably not know that a huge part of the seating area at the boarding gate is behind the counter, so if you were sitting there, you couldn't see the boards at all, while another member of staff was trying to shout what zones were being boarded when. This confused a lot of people, that simply couldn't hear or see what was being announced. The worst is yet to come, as our return flight MEL to DXB was delayed by two hours due to fog on an earlier flight, this made us miss our connecting flights in Dubai. You'd think that, with such a big airline as Emirates everything would be fine as they surely have other flights to go onto. You would be wrong though, we were rebooked onto a flight the next morning, so 45 people on the London flight alone were stuck in Dubai for a full day. Again, staff were slow taking more than an hour to process the 10 of us in the queue.",Detractor

Flight was delayed for more than an hour due to bad weather which one can ignore. However, flight from Islamabad to Dubai was ok even though the airplane was not very clean. Staff was cooperative. But as soon as we landed in Dubai, we were like stranded. There was no counter or any staff to help us or guide us. The fellow passengers were helpful enough to guide us. We had 18 hrs connecting flight to Bologna. It took us more than a hour to find the Emirates counter regarding hotel room. My mother cannot walk a lot. Finally when we found the counter and asked for hotel room, Emirates staff was rude and denied us room. Finally, seeing condition of my mother I offered to pay for the room.

"  Bangkok to Hong Kong. Purchased the ticket last minute due to sudden change of plan, approached check in desk 60 minutes before a supposedly 13:45 departure and was told off about being late. Once airside, boarding was not announced until 13:45 and flight departed at 15:00. There were many Emirates staff hanging around at the gate but no one bothered to make an announcement. Clearly Bangkok's gate holding lounges are not designed to accommodate a full load of A380 passengers and it was jam packed. No effort was made by the Emirates ground staff to separate passengers. Boarding at the beginning was a free flow until several very sultry ground staff restored order. Once on board, cabin crew was cold. The lady responsible for the area I sat in was very rude with people that do not speak fluent English when distributing the 'meal' (tasteless and cold curry chicken rice) and if you dare to ask her for something she does not have in the trolley (Diet Coke for example), the request would fall on deaf ear. Despite such rudeness, service was slow and inefficient. They only served the meal one hour after take off and barely managed to collect the trays at top of descent.

  Bucharest to Perth via Athens and Dubai. Booked online thinking they are a 'premium airline' that offers great all-round service and the flights they had would get us home a bit quicker than our usual airline so we took a chance. Booking went smoothly until we tried to select seats! Couldn't select first leg at all (understandable as with another airline and of course directed to that airline that didn't even recognise the booking!). Second leg booked seats together OK. But site wouldn't give access to third leg - Dubai to Perth. Kept trying and after day of trying got access. 5 seats left and none together! You have to be joking. Booking made as two people. So they get your money but then you can't even sit together. Absolute joke Emirates. Needless to say we won't ever use Emirates again. We will stick to our usual airline in future. Unfortunately I see many have the same issue with seat allocations. Should have done my research better.,Detractor
"  Paris to Kuala Lumpur via Dubai.I am disappointed with Emirates. The entertainment is excellent, the food is good, the seat is comfortable, the aircraft is clean, the staff are okay. My flight from Paris to Dubai was delayed 3 hours because of bad weather. The ground staff at Paris reassured us that we will be taken care of if we missed our connecting flight. We landed at Dubai at about 10.20 pm instead of the scheduled 9.40 pm. We need about 5-10 minutes to get off the plane and proceed to the transit area. There were 2 staff holding boards, for the Bangkok flight passengers and other destination. We checked the departure screen and read that our connecting flight was boarding. All of the Kuala Lumpur flight passengers ran to the gate, just to know that the flight had departed at 10.30 pm. We were very shocked. If it had waited 10 more minutes, all of the passangers would not be stranded at the Dubai airport, on new years eve. We were forced to queue at the ground office for hours to find our flight home. My family got lucky. We got our flight home after standing for 2 and a half hours. We were rerouted, flying from Dubai to Kuala Lumpur via Dhaka, using Bangladesh Airlines. We paid for Emirates, got Biman and extra trouble of tracing our baggage. Amazing way to start the year. I would be much grateful if the ground staff and the cabin staff had communicated better and at least some direction or guidance from the Emirates for the lost passengers.

"  Birmingham to Male return via Dubai. Unfortunately Emirates has declined over the last few years, and now I try my best to avoid using them. I had problems both legs of the return journey. Firstly our flight got cancelled from Maldives which caused a lot of stress and losses (time and money). They gave some skywards miles as goodwill gesture which were worthless.

"  Newcastle to Bangkok via Dubai. We always fly with Emirates when going to Thailand as usually the service is excellent. We boarded the flight at Newcastle and found our seats were not the ones I had booked back in March! I told a member of the cabin crew and she said she would get her supervisor that didn't happen! So when we arrived in Krabi minus our luggage because that was left in Bangkok due to the late arrival our our Dubai flight I emailed Emirates only to be told it could have been operational reasons we were bumped, but I feel really strongly that we are being fobbed off by them. Why bother giving you the option to book seats then move you anyway. What makes another passenger better than me and why should they get the seat I'd booked all those months in advance. I have since replied to them and asked the question again. I think the cabin crew are not as attentive as they used to be either. I know to some people the seat saga is petty but it's a big thing to me. All I hope is we get the seats we booked on our return flights. I will not say I won't fly with them again but it has made me think there maybe better airlines out there to try.",Detractor

I was pretty happy with everything overall. The seats were comfy, I ended up with a window seat with two empty seats next to me, which was great. The entertainment system was brilliant. Lots to choose from. The wifi didn't work too well, but that wasn't an issue. The staff were very polite and helpful, blankets, wet towels, warm towels, pillows and headphones all supplied. The food wasn't amazing but wasn't an issue either. The only thing I wasn't impressed with were the ground staff at Dubai. No one was particularly helpful when I asked about my luggage being transferred. Apart from that I was very happy with Emirates and I will definitely use them on my next trip to Thailand.",Passive
"  Bangkok to London via Dubai. Emirates is one of our favourite airlines. We have flown economy with them several times to Asia as well as to South Africa. We like their service, find the seats comfortable and have never experienced problems with the excellent ICE system. I hardly ever sleep on planes and find it comforting to have so much good entertainment during the long flights. We like the food. We have always had good experience with check-in, boarding and disembarkment. So when I had an accident during our last trip to Thailand and broke my ankle, I was fitted with an Aircast so that I could fly home. My insurance was taking care of everything but the one thing they refused, no matter how many times I asked or even with a written statement from my doctor, was to upgrade my husband so that he could be by my side during the long and uncomfortable journey home. I was unable to walk unaided and therefore needed personal assistance. I was upgraded to Business Class, which would have been a great experience under any other circumstances. As it was I daren't eat or drink much of what was on offer (all looked delicious) out of fear of being caught short bathroom wise. The Bangkok to Dubai leg in Business Class was full admittedly, but the Dubai to Gatwick leg was only half occupied. Rather petty to insist my husband sits downstairs leaving his injured wife on her own upstairs. Come on Emirates, you could have done better.",Promoter
"  My mother was flying from Rome to Melbourne via Dubai. Being an elderly person she can't walk for too long and she can't speak English, therefore we requested assistance with wheelchair access, which was all confirmed. However when she arrived in Dubai, my mother was left unattended, no one picked her up, no one gave her instructions, she had to make her own way to the next terminal fearing she wasn't able to make it, and we all know how big Dubai Airport is. She arrived in Melbourne exhausted and very stressed because of what happened to her in Dubai. She's an elderly women and very anxious to go back home in February, because she is fearing she could be left alone in Dubai again. I'm very disappointed about this event.",Detractor
"  Flew with Emirates from Athens to Cebu via Dubai for our Christmas holidays. All four flights were on Boeing 777-300ER. Three out of four were on dated aircraft, the touchscreen small and the 3x4x3 seat configuration made the flights unpleasant. On the other side, the ICE system was excellent, with a great selection of movies, documentaries and games.The food was above average. The FA's were efficient, very helpful and with a smile. On the outbound flight, we had a 9 hour layover in Dubai, so the airline provided us a free hotel at the in Copthorne airport hotel, just 5 mins drive from the airport, with breakfast included. I coose Emirates because it was the airline with a straight flight to Cebu from the Gulf without a layover in Manila. I would recommend Emirates, but i think Qatar Airways is a better choice.",Passive
"  Manchester to Dubai. Having flown before with Emirates and on the A380 business class this was our choice for our family holiday. On being shown our seats (very last ones in front of the bar) we noticed the ICE system wasn't working. We pointed this out and the crew said they needed to reboot it - this was done on take off but failed and wiped out more screens! As it was the night flight we decided just to sleep but to our horror the bed didn't work. This was sorted out but we were left with no ICE system. Staff said they'd report it and contact customer service when back home. The response was simple, no refund and we were offered some air miles! Not good service.",Passive
"  I took a first class ticket Dubai to Kuwait, but overall I was disappointed with the experience. First, my chauffeur driver never informed the hotel that he was waiting for me outside as I instructed EK to do so via my telephone conversation in Dubai. I had no idea he was waiting for me outside. The first class check-in experience was not as tremendous as I anticipated. Basically there was attention given to me, but I never felt like a first class passenger. They let me check-in in the express check-in counter as opposed to the first class counter. The food and service provided in the first class lounge in concourse A is unacceptable. Not only was the food tasteless, but it takes a very long time to prepare something for me from a la carte menu. For example, it took approximately 10 - 15 minutes to provide me my club sandwich, and 15 - 20 minutes to provide me the ""um ali"" sweet. All this while the lounge was empty. While I was waiting for my food the waiter asked me what I wanted to drink and I told him water, he kept goofing around and I chased him until he gave me my water. This is unacceptable for first class service. During boarding business class passengers entered door 1A with us as opposed to door 2A, thus ruining the exclusive experience of first class. Upon disembark, business class passengers were trying to skip queue and leave the aircraft before first class passengers do. I will not be flying Emirates first class again and will look for alternatives such as Qatar Airways.",Detractor
  Mumbai to London via Dubai. Wasn't the greatest experience with Emirates - check in was a headache. We were 8 kilos overweight between two of us and they charged us for the excess. Boarding was fine and seats comfortable but they feel a little claustrophobic. The staff were good. My wife was charmed by her attendant but I got the feeling my attendant thought she was doing me a favour by serving me. It doesn't cost any thing and takes minimal effort to smile when talking to a customer. Meals were only served within a timeslot so you couldn't eat when you wanted to and weren't really up to expectations. The champagne wasn't served cold enough. I had to return 3 glasses and in the end I went to the bar myself to make sure. The bar itself was a bit of a disappointment but maybe we were too tired to appreciate it. The seat has an area with a selection of soft drinks which you can access yourself. Unfortunately its protective frame needed two arms to prise up and then the drinks weren't cold so I had to call for ice. The entertainment system was a bit tricky to operate and took a little while to work the IFE. The upper deck of business class probably had 100 passengers in total and felt a little overwhelming. I felt that there were not enough attendants for the number they were taking care of. There were 4 loos between us but the loos were just a bit larger than the economy toilets and disappointing. I couldn't use one because it was too messed up. When we landed no attendant offered to help my wife with her luggage from the overhead locker but it was nice to have our own upper deck exit way. On reading through this I do sound a bit like a spoiled brat and complaining over small things. But if some airlines can get these right so why not Emirates? The entire business and first class were sold out on every leg we travelled so they have plenty of customers who are happy with Emirates product.,Passive
"  This was the 2nd leg of our journey from Gatwick to Ho Chi Minh City with Emirates, the first having been on a A380. We arrived in the morning local time and left in the morning local time. The food on the first leg was ok - not brilliant, but not awful just average. When we got on the next flight we were served a seafood lunch, at 9 am (ish) local time or 6 am as per our body clocks. Needless to say it remained untouched. Can't fathom why a lunch was served so early in the day. The bus from terminal to plane was extraordinarily long and seemed to take for ever but was most definitely at least 20-25 mins. The aircraft itself was definitely very dated and the seats far from the best. All in all it was a distinctly average experience and isn't likely to encourage us to use Emirates in the future. Having said all of that it was relatively cheap for Business class so I guess in this instance you sort of get what you pay for. (Best food to date was on ANA, best seats on Qantas A380)",Passive
"  San Francisco to Kolkata via Dubai. Dubai happens to be a great midpoint between San Francisco and India and is also a nice city. I have flown many times with Emirates business class from SFO to India, via Dubai. however my last flight with them in September was the worst and that is what this review is about. Really bad food on the flights - so much so that for much of the flight I stayed hungry. I am not particularly finicky about food. This is not an issue with Dubai to India (shorter flight) but a real issue for SFO to DXB. On this occasion I swapped my Business class seat with my wife's economy class. Extremely rude staff, started an argument whether I can visit my wife in business class. This was lodged as a complaint with Emirates but I did not hear anything in the last 3 months. So rude staff, and ineffective management that does nothing even on feedback. Wife was pregnant and unwell, threw up on the flight in the Business class seat and requested that I be called from the economy section for a few minutes. The confused staff bumbled around for a few minutes and did nothing.",Detractor
"  New York to Chennai via Dubai. Went in with great expectations, but it was an average experience. Flight from JFK to Dubai was okay but the flight from Dubai to Chennai was worse.

But crew told vegetarian meal was not available when coming to me and then I have to argue with them to get my vegetarian meal. Overall average experience for a world class airline - I had been in Qatar Airways before and it was way better.",Detractor

Very spacious and comfortable. The food was excellent, and the presentation was traditional but effective. I would recommend Emirates.",Promoter
"  I flew from London Gatwick to Brisbane via Dubai, returning via Singapore and Dubai. My flight from Gatwick to DXB was extremely pleasant, entertainment was great, the A380 was excellent. Food was great as well, I cleared all the meals. The disappointing part of the journey were the cabin crew, they just didn't seem available and welcoming. They just seemed to be very tired and were too much involved and busy in chatting among themselves. Overall this leg was great, apart from the cabin crew. DXB to BNE was even worse in that field, the flight was already very long, which was stressful enough. I had a massive headache, and when I consulted one member of the cabin crew (she was a supervisor), she just told me to go back to my seat and watch movies, as they offered lots of choice. And that annoyed me, I thought cabin crew were supposed to be of support during a flight. The return flights from BNE to SIN, SIN to DXB were excellent, and even the crew were excellent and seemed professional and friendly. No comment on the DXB to LGW flight as it was well packed, so the cabin crew were busy - other than that I slept the whole flight so can't say much.",Passive

"  I booked the flights from Manchester to Melbourne via Dubai through Carlton leisure and was surprised that Qantas Airways were working in partnership with Emirates. The flight I am reviewing is flight Manchester to Dubai on 6th November. The seats were comfortable and there was plenty of room to move around during the flight. However it was very obvious that the crew were struggling to provide a service. The flight lasted for 8 hours and within that time we only recived 2 cups of water, which had to be asked for. Once the meals were brought round, I was told that there were no more of what I wanted and had to settle for a the second choice. A few minutes later I saw one of the cabin crew serving my original choice and asked if I could change my meal. The reply from the cabin crew was that it was the last one. On opening the meal it looked as if it had been put through a blender and only ate half of the meal due to the fact that I was so hungry with only two cup of water previously. My partner and I will not be flying with Emirates again.",Passive
"  Good business class experience flying from Dubai to Cairo. Now Emirates operates only 777s and A380s the product is very consistent and particularly welcomed on these shorter flights. Warm and friendly crew, aircraft in good condition and a choice of Rose or Brut champagne plus juices before take off. A pleasant hot breakfast was served and the crew remained visible and active throughout the flight. Washrooms were kept spotless and well stocked with amenities including Bulgari cologne. The only negative was that we were delayed waiting for late passengers which meant we lost our slot and consequentially were 30 minutes late arriving at Cairo. I regularly fly all 3 Gulf airlines and Emirates offers a superior product in both economy and business class.",Promoter

Cabin crew busy inviting guys from economy to the bar and taking photos with them.

Rest of the sectors were ok. Cabin crew on board were a hit and missed and lacked consistency in quality. Food on board was very bad. Cabin Crew and Food has been on a downward spiral out of control over the years and there does not seem to be any appetite from management to improve service. This being said, flights were reasonably close to time and IFE was not bad. Emirates is slipping and it has become obvious.",Passive
"  Gatwick to Maldives via Dubai. Emirates was highly recommended to us but all I can say is it was a big disappointment and we are dreading our return flight with them. Positives - polite staff, seats comfortable. Negatives - service and amenities. Husband not able to use IFE controls as it had jammed. We ordered two courses as suggested on the menu booklet for a light eater. Waited one and half hours after first course for cheese (we ordered with our starter as we did not want the main course) - told that it had all gone as they had served everyone else in the cabin, even those behind us. After showing our displeasure, they did make up for this by getting us some cheese and offering good wine from first class. Why not offer this in first place rather than telling us the cheese had gone? On a long flight that arrives at night (2am), we wanted to sleep - not an amenity bag in sight. I asked for one and was told they only supply on night flights. Well I'm sorry but when I board and arrive somewhere early in the morning then I expect an amenity bag. That is night time and that is when you require those bits and pieces that add a little (paid for) luxury to the start of a hard earned holiday. Having paid thousands for business I do not expect an airline to be so stingy - they should supply amenity bags regardless of time of flying. People do need to wash and clean teeth and freshen up during any long haul flight. This is appalling cost cutting meanness and sorry I thought my thousands in air fare bought me a small bag of comfort. I have flown business with other airlines and received much better service. I was so excited to fly with Emirates as I heard good reports, but they will not be my first choice again really not good value for money. Felt there was no balance between profit and service what they needed to do was so little but the impact would have been so positive. Very sad.",Detractor

"  Gatwick to Mauritius return via Dubai. We have flown round the world with various airlines, but this was the first time with Emirates. It was so comfortable, the in-seat entertainment the best we have seen and the staff, both in the air and on the ground, were helpful. We spent twenty eight hours on four flights and the staff did everything they could to make us comfortable. The check in staff were friendly and the process swift and easy. Their uniforms are smart and professional. Boarding was simple and, because there were three gangways, one to upstairs, it was quick. The A380 is quiet. The food was very good. The lighting onboard was perfect. During night hours it's a dark gently blue ceiling with twinkling stars. At dawn, it is exactly that. The entertainment system. Three external camera views and one little oddity that I found a complete Godsend. On the music section, I found a sleep hypnosis track by Anna Rowe. My mistake was putting it on ""repeat"" because some way into it, I had gone. But then when it started again, it woke me up! The seats were comfortable and a good non-intrusive recline. The usual cushion, blanket, headphones etc. If you bring your own headphones/noise cancellers etc, make sure enough bring the double-plug airline adaptor with you because their headphone sockets are dual-plug. You can use your mobile, get data and charge devices. The plane has its own mobile service for you to connect to, watch out though, it's not cheap, so best to go on airline mode in case your phone auto-cones and someone rings you from home. We always choose either side of an aisle, not far from the loos. Economy class, at the front, there are four loos, which is very good. and they were very clean.",Promoter
"  Delhi to Sao Paulo via Dubai. From the chauffeur pick-up and drop to boarding, the experience was very smooth. The cabin was lit with mood lighting and both long haul aircraft had the StarLight, unique to Emirates, a feature I find amazing - to lie down and look at stars while you fly! Cabin crew service differed on the long hauls, inconsistency is the name of the game for cabin service in Emirates. The crew from Rio to Dubai could not do enough for you while the attendant on the Dubai to Sao Paulo leg was asking passengers to lift out the tables for dining! The seat itself is comfortable in a lie-flat position but has terribly limited storage. The IFE is fantastic. What Emirates misses is the dine-on-demand on ultra long hauls and pyjamas. The amenity kits by Bvglari and clean, well stocked washrooms were very welcome. WiFi on board was available on both long hauls. What I love on Emirates is their food but it was disappointing on the flight from Rio due to probably a lack of catering's understanding of an Asian Vegetarian Meal. The transit in Dubai gives you access to the trimmings in the Business Class Lounge along with a Moet and Chandon Bar, shower facilities, healthy cuisine etc. All in all, a very glamorous, luxurious experience and will recommend.",Promoter

Washrooms were kept clean, and stocked with cologne, toothbrushes, shaving kits etc. We landed on time, immigration and baggage delivery were fast and I was in the limo within 30 minutes of landing.

The headphone jack was not working, the recline button on my seat was not working. The seat itself was not completely fixed. It kept slipping. When the food arrived, my main course looked like it had been opened and it wasn't even hot. Some passengers could not have their first choice meal. When we landed in Dubai, we had to be bussed to the terminal. The return flight was worse. Seating in the middle of the middle row (seats E/F) is definitely a mistake. The cabin staff seemed oblivious to us. They kept missing us when the drinks were being offered. (we only wanted a cup of tea!). They even forgot to ask us for their headphones and blankets at the end of the flight. There was hardly anytime between the main meal and snacks. We found one or two of the cabin staff who served us rather unprofessional. All in all, a pretty disappointing experience. The A380 is an excellent aeroplane and hats off to the pilot and his crew but I feel that the cabin staff could not handle the number of passengers it can carry. Will only use this airline if I really have too. We had a wonderful holiday in Dubai but the return flight left a bad taste in the mouth.",Detractor

"  Flew Emirates from Melbourne to Auckland. Seat 23K on upper deck of the A380 rear cabin. This leg was upgraded to Business by invitation, thus I was not eligible to access the lounge, which was fine. Upon boarding, ground crew saw my Boarding Pass and allowed me to enter the waiting area, which led to early boarding, that was quite nice. The cabin was almost empty to the point I was the only seating passenger at the rear. Crew members were all overly friendly and took their turns to greet me individually by remembering my surname - I never felt so spoiled. One flight attendant even handed me an amenity kit, which was not complementary for such a short hop across the Tasman. Bar service was exceptional as well, I was invited to have a drink and talk to the crew members, who are not shy at smiling towards the passengers and being professional at the same time. Breakfast was tasty, signature sweets were particularly delicious. I consumed two bottles of drink from the mini bar, and it was replenished in-flight. WiFi was slow and hard to use. The cabin flown was not fitted with the airlines' brand new products, edges and corners have started showing some tiny wear and tear - this was the only drawback that I am able to think of. The crew members deserve the highest praise, I felt that they walked the extra mile to maintain a conversation with me, just like being with friends.

All flights pretty much on time but arrival in DXB and having to bus from a remote stand to the terminal is nonsense. As usual variable standards from the cabin crew - infrequent drinks runs and disorganised meal service resulting in myself and another passenger, not even being offered a meal - it's not exactly very complicated, and the flight was only half full.

The plane is basically a flying cattle market and it is obvious that Emirates are moving towards to a pile 'em high, sell 'em cheap service, except that it's not so cheap. The service from cabin crew was virtually non-existent apart from serving the meal and collecting headsets/blankets at the end of the flights. Call bells were left unanswered throughout both flights with passengers resorting to self service to get a drink. No drinks runs other than with the meal. Seat pitch and width has also been reduced downstairs compared to the 3 class A380 (no doubt to cram more seats in). Emirates service has noticeably deteriorated over the last 12 months.

The aircraft's are in impeccable shape and the usual, low, levels of noise with the A380. Comfortable flight in both cases. It has been noted that the FA quality can be variable. On these two flights the FA's were pretty good and attentive. One with Emirates is that they have their FA's clean up the cabins. That means collecting rubbish, blankets, headphones, whatever is not tied down. It bugs me as I just do not think it is a good look for the airline to have their staff act as cleaners and rubbish collectors. That is the job of the ground crew and its messy to look at with bags of blankets walking up and down the aisles. The IFE is less good than you think. Movie selection is great when you have many hundreds but not when they are mostly foreign language. The English selection is poorly made up and could not find many or any I really wanted to see.

"  London Gatwick to Dubai return. The Emirates A380 is huge, quiet and with a brilliant in-flight entertainment system, only let down by the headphones. So my advice is but a two pin adaptor and wear your owns to get the full benefit. But that's where it ends. On both the outbound and return legs, the inflight service was terrible. Slow to the point of lazy, a choice of menu that's undeliverable by the time they've reached the middle of the flight, staff who offer little by the way of a solution when asked what's possible and disinterested in passenger comfort. I had to wait 40 minutes for a meal to be offered to me after I asked for a different main course to what was available in the trolley, and then it was the same meal I had declined. I asked to speak to the cabin manager twice, who finally arrived 10 mins later to apologize. On the return flight, the experience was much the same. No choice of menu for over half the passengers, two hours into flight before offered a drink and my meal arrived 50 minutes (!) after my wife's vegetarian ""choice"" was offered to her. This was labelled Vegan which isn't what was ordered and then another 10 minutes debate occurred with the cabin crew who said that there was nothing else available unless she wanted to wait until the end of service to see what was ""left"". When I was finally presented with the remaining meal choice (chicken with olive sauce) I had to ask for a drink, and the steward said the drinks trolley was on its way - it was half the length of the plane away! Somehow other passengers were given drinks with their meals, but we at the ""back"" were treated as an after thought. The passengers behind us had exactly the same experience. A note of advice for Emirates. Olives are a divisive ingredient, people either like or dislike olives so if you include a meal with olives, more people will avoid it than choose it! Leaving you short of choice! The overhead luggage cabin had crew luggage which they proceeded to access a number of times during the flight - constantly bumping my head as they reached up. On one occasion, the stewardess walked off and left it open for 10 minutes before coming back to close it. So my overriding impression of the airline is that it needs to improve quality of service on a human level. It's all very well having the latest aeroplane but if passenger experience is based on what's on tv, and food and drink service is a secondary concern, I for one won't fly with them again.",Detractor

I have previously done this with multiple airlines without any issues.

"  Kuala Lumpur to Frankfurt via Dubai with Emirates. This perhaps is my worst flight experience ever. My flight and seat was booked and confirmed 3 months in advance. When arriving back at Dubai airport for my Dubai - Frankfurt flight EK045, they informed me that the flight was over booked and refused me check-in despite arriving more than 2 hours before departure because I did not do online check-in. Apparently my seat has been allocated to another passenger. They offered me the next available flight and free ticket but I refused as I was traveling with my colleagues and had to be in Frankfurt for a meeting. The customer service said that I have to wait until check in is closed to see whether is there any available seat. After waiting until almost boarding time, they finally allocated me a seat and ask me to rush to the gate. Onboard, I checked in my coat and went to the allocated the seat 65C which is right next to the lavatory. Throughout the entire 6.5 hour journey, it was just horrible. I'm entirely fine with me with people going in and out of the toilet. But every half and hour or so, someone and somehow loss their sense direction and came knocking into me. Just before landing, I press the assistance button to retrieve my coat. Nobody answered. Upon landing, I immediately walked up to a stewardess asking for my coat and she said I had to wait until all the passengers leave so that they can bring it up from the back of the plane. I mean, this returning of the coats or whatever should be done naturally before the plane lands and need not to be instructed. Obviously I was the last to board the plane and the last to leave the plane in this flight. To me, this is unacceptable for a world class airline they claimed to be. Even a budget airlines has better service than the Emirates.",Detractor
"Mauritius to Frankfurt via Dubai with Emirates. The night flight from Mauritius to Dubai departed 11 pm. Business as usual, very positive reception on the aircraft, hand luggage was stored away, crosscheck and takeoff. Then Emirates showed their way of customer care once again. First beverage service 90 minutes after take-off together with dinner - actually not a meal but disgusting. After lights were turned off part of the crew was gathering in the service-station directly behind row 51 to loudly exchange their experiences on Mauritius while slamming some compartment doors. Passenger complaints did not bother them at all. Any cabin sevice was discontinued. Even on request. I never ever was confronted with such a rude cabin crew behaviour - Fly Emirates does not mean Enjoy Emirates.",Passive
"  In short: Unprofessional and rude cabin service, awful meals, dirty cabin, and most annoying is that the cabin crew just don't seem to care about anything. I'm a frequent traveler (usually every other week on CX or MY) I only choose Emirates since the kids wanted to travel on an A380 from Bangkok to Hong Kong. We had seats 52H/J/K next to the galley, to say passengers may find the noise from the galley troublesome is a huge understatement. Firstly, the galley is brightly lit and lights shine directly on you, they don't use a curtain. Even if you block the light with a mask you have the noise, lots of noise, if it's not the constant banging of the galley cupboard doors it's the cabin crew talking. Meals were low grade and poor quality. Meal service took forever and was completely unorganized, my special meal arrived and then was promptly removed never to return. 50 minutes later I was offered a regular meal. Condensation from the galley freezers made the floor soaking wet in front of and below our seats - the crew explained this always happens and covered the area in blankets. ICE system is good, but the headphones are a perfect example of form over function - who has square ears? EK385, was met at BKK airport with stairs on the tarmac about 20 minutes after landing, and free bus ride to the terminal. Even LCCs like AirAsia afford their passengers an air bridge to walk into the terminal.",Detractor
"  I flew from Paris CDG to Dubai DXB on Saturday 1 October 2016, 15.35 â€“ 00.20 with Emirates, EK 074. The flight was good, but the service is far from expected. I asked for a hot chocolate during the meal time, it took ages and I had to ask another flight attendant. When it arrived it was cold and had been filled with cold milk. I made a complaint to the purser, she apologised and they served another one. During the dessert, they served ice cream, but for myself and my wife there was no spoon. We ended up with the tea stirrer. Furthermore, I saw a flight attendant queuing for the toilets in front of me, and refusing to assist passengers. Usually, they use the toilet at the far end, in the back. I really regret picking Emirates.",Detractor
"A nightmare journey from Dubai to Cape Town with Emirates. Poor seating, very cramped, air crew unfriendly. Captain spent 5 mins telling us that the crew were award winning.

"Houston to Trivandrum via Dubai with Emirates. I had a 2 hour lay over in Dubai, and had plans to shop for a couple of things from the duty free. However due to the delayed take off, I was sprinting through Dubai airport in order to not miss my flight to Houston, reaching it just 3 mins before the gate closed. Such a delay is not my first experience with Emirates. Staff onboard were just okay except one - the rest of them all seemed stressed out. The economy class seats are extremely uncomfortable for a 16+ hours long flight. Non-spacious and no leg space. Inflight entetainment is nice, but that is the least of my concerns, I do not wish to fly with Emirates again.",Detractor
"  Dallas to Bangalore return via Dubai. When i booked my ticket on the Emirates website it was clearly mentioned that the Dallas flights would be on their A380 aircraft. I was excited to fly on Emirates and try out their new amenities in the Business cabin including the bar and space to move around. However on the day of the journey I find out that instead of the A380 the aircraft was now a Boeing 777-300ER. A much smaller plane. Instead of the spacious and luxurious Business cabin they had changed our seats - it was now 2-3-2 with some of the business seats having no direct aisle access. I was in the window seat so was stuck trying to get to the aisle on both legs of my journey. The seats seemed a bit worn out, the IFE control a bit heavy and clunky and it was not a lie-flat seat, which on such a long journey is a huge problem. I hated the trip and felt completely let down. If they had not indicated that this was going to be a A380 I would never have flown with them and given them my money. Emirates then did an about face when I contacted them via email saying its well within their rights to change equipment and not inform passengers! Really for all their big hue and cry of looking out for passengers its pretty obvious that they could not care less. Not even a decent apology for pulling the old bait and switch and then feigning ignorance.",Detractor
"  The flight from Bangkok to Dubai was very smooth and easy. First time enter the aircraft it was too warm in cabin, no AC I guess, when you sit on your seat you must turn on your own cooler. It happened also when I continue from Dubai to Paris. The cabin crew was friendly and they are busy so take time if you request something. The food is not special, the toilet is clean. And when 30 minutes before landing the cabin crew will take your blanket and headset, and that make me uncomfortable, I think they shouldn't do that. And for seat in economy it was very good and comfortable.",Promoter
"  Cape Town to Dubai. The timing of the meals on this 9-hour overnight flight was senseless. Firstly, it took them 3 hours to serve supper, by which time I'd lost interest and gone to sleep. Then, they woke me up 3.5 hours before landing for breakfast, which I also declined because of poor timing. So, there was only a two-hour window when the cabin didn't smell like a restaurant.",Detractor
"Flew Emirates from Manchester to Kuala Lumpur via Dubai. 2 hours delay at Manchester, but once in the air a very pleasant flight food was of a good quality and the entertainment system is superb. 2 hour delay at Dubai, sat on plane for an hour, to be taken off because flight crew had passed their hours, a further 2 hour delay, but to be honest they handled it well, we were fed and watered and I can think of worst airports to be stuck in. B777 not as comfortable as A380 because of 3x4x3 configuration. Return flights were on time and food excellent.",Promoter
"  Nice to Adelaide via Dubai. From Nice to Dubai we were in Economy class and had the best service from the Steward looking after us. Comparing to other airlines we had bit more leg room and the seats were comfy. From Dubai to Adelaide we were upgraded to business class. What a treat. It was amazing, and staff wonderful, extremely professional. My husband and I will give a 10 out of 10 from service to facilities.",Promoter
"  London to Johannesburg via Dubai. It was our first flight with Emirates and we had high expectations . Although our seats had been booked prior to arrival at the airport we were advised to change them by the check in clerk who said we would have four seats between two of us in one particular row. This was not so. Although we passed one man who was stretched out across several seats to himself, the two other seats in our new row were occupied by the largest lady on the aircraft plus her hand luggage. It happened to be my birthday on the day that we flew and I must say it spoiled my birthday somewhat. When we flew two days later from Dubai to Johannesburg, boarding staff asked how my birthday had gone, I replied that since she had brought it up it had been spoiled by the events during the previous flight. I was then told to request a particular row on this flight where we could have better seats as some way of recompense. When we boarded the plane once again, we were let down and the seats were not available. I tweeted and complained formally to Emirates about this. It actually took them 32 days to reply and that was after prompting and more tweeting. Many tweets and private messages on Twitter were actually ignored. When we eventually received a response it was disappointing and did not even refer to the fact that one passenger had four seats to himself. I have never come across such poor customer service to be frank. We certainly would never fly with Emirates again.",Detractor
"  Lisbon to Bangkok return via Dubai. First Leg of the flight happy that was on time out of Lisbon, early on Dubai short connection so it was good, the flight crew was fantastic on that leg. Second leg from Dubai to Bangkok I must say that I am starting to hate the A380-800 - many people not sufficient capacity from the crew, imagine get a meal and only 45 minutes later something to drink. Second part of the journey Bangkok to Dubai with a flight coming from Hong Kong seats assigned could you imagine all dirty, made me sit on them until other place was free, it was really dirty, in the end after some complaint got me a place on the rear of the plane - at least the plane was half full so could stretch a little and sleep all the way. Final leg to Lisbon on my favorite Boeing 777 because it has a fantastic last three rows with 2 places and lots of space. I have travelled a lot by Emirates but somehow the difference to others is not that much right now, going to try Qatar Airways the next trip. Not happy, the service has gone down.",Passive
"  I have been flying with Emirates for business and leisure for over 10 years and have only flown Economy class where I have found the service to be of excellent standards. Recently I was offered the option to upgrade to business class and I decided to pay the additional premium. The service I received during my flight was disappointing, and quite substandard. Dubai to Manchester the journey began really well. After 15 minutes into the flight my TV and all electrical equipment failed to work which meant I couldn't not watch TV, close the blinds or switch off the overhead light. I made the cabin staff aware of this and was advised that she would reset the TV and this would resolve the issue. One hour had passed and none of the faults had been fixed. On my way to the toilets, I raised the concern once again and was advised that the reset would be done again and that it should resolve the issue. I sat patiently waiting throughout the meal service without any form of entertainment. I then decided to lay back my seat and get some rest and was constantly annoyed by the overhead light which I could not turn off. 2 hours had passed and a second cabin staff came by asking me to leave my seat so she could reset the electrical switches which were located under my seat. This was done twice without any positive result. The service I received in business class became anything but relaxing. Almost 3.5 hours into the flight and half way through my journey I was offered the chance to move to another seat which I found unacceptable and a little too late in the day. I emailed the customer affairs department and they offered me 25,000 air miles which amount to nothing. I cannot even get an upgrade! Really disappointed with Emirates and the way they have dealt with this. I do not recommend flying Emirates Business class, really not worth the extra money you pay. If you have an issue on the flight don't count on dealing with their complaints team after as they wont offer you anything, try and get what you want while your on the flight.",Detractor
"  I had a disappointing flight in business class from Washington to Dubai, flight service was 1 out of 10. From beginning of flight, the attendants ignored me, they even haven't gave me complimentary welcome package before take off and just passed me like they don't see me - I complained to them and they said they have no more left! At Dubai airport after waiting 30 min for my luggage, i became to know that they left my luggage in Washington Dulles airport. So i send them email asking for refunds and after a month on 22/09/2016 they sent me an email says they will not refund but they will top-up my mile account with 20000 miles as a gesture of goodwill.

  Dubai to London Heathrow. Check in was quick and nowadays there seems to be a lot of issues regarding carrying Samsung 7 phones and staff are extremely strict and vigilant about this matter. The plane was parked in a different area and you had to climb the stairs to access the upper deck. The seats were the usual A380 ones which I really like. We took off promptly and landed ahead of time. A light meal was served after take off although almost everyone went to sleep. Breakfast was given before landing. staff were efficient and extremely pleasant. I asked for some tablets for headache and they quickly got some green tea along with chocolate bars along with it! Overall a very good flight.,Promoter
  This is a convenient flight which leaves around 11 am and gets into Dubai at 8 am the next day. Check in was swift and boarding took place efficiently and on time. The flight departed around 45 minutes later than schedule. Seats of A380 on EK are always one of my favorite ones although this aircraft showed a lot of wear and tear. Service was very good and the crew attended all the passengers on this full flight very efficiently. Two main meals were served and there were smaller snacks that could be taken anytime. IFE remains as one of the best and inflight wifi is dirt cheap at 1$ for 500mb. We landed on time and bags were out in a jiffy.,Promoter
  Washington to Dubai. I arrived early at Dulles airport and the counters opened only 3 hours before departure so I had to wait. Check in was swift and we could use premier lanes for security which can be of great help when its busy. The plane was very full in all 3 classes. Crew were extremely nice and the flight was a comfortable 12 hour journey. The seats are one of the best with lots of space and storage available. Emirates is the best airline for IFE and also for the fact that you can purchase on board wifi at only 1 USD for 500 mb!!,Promoter
"  I flew Bangalore to San Francisco in Buiness class. The Bangalore - Dubai segment was on a B777, and the business class was all right, the configuration is 2-3-2 and not all seats have direct aisle access, but this was only a short flight (4 hours). The flight from DXB to SFO on an A380 was fantastic with staggered seating in cabin, excellent cabin service and food. The bar on the A380 is a huge plus as it's a nice way to unwind and socialize with fellow travelers on a long flight. The chauffeur service provided by Emirates for business and first class customers is amazing. Also the best IFE that I have seen. There is free wifi on board upto 10MB however it is very patchy and I didn't have connectivity for the most part.",Promoter
"  Guangzhou to London via Dubai. The best thing about Emirates is their cabin crew who are excellent. The worst thing is their business class seats which are appalling on their older A380's. To get into the seat is very tight unless you are a fashion model, if you are anything but a model then the tray that pulls out for eating is just crazy - I would need to lose at least 3 stone to be able to use it. It will not go past my tummy and what pregnant women would do is just beyond me. On the later A380's they have changed this tray realising that their first effort was hopeless and very badly designed. However their is very little space in this business class seat and I was very disappointed. Travelling often on business to the Far East this has to be the worst seat I have ever sat in. The food is OK but not being able to put it in front of you is frustrating. The crew know all about this problem as they told me they often get complaints. Add all this to the extra long flight by travelling via Dubai and I will be going back to good old Far East airlines who fly direct.",Passive

Emirates A380s compared to European airlines A380 aircrafts are a totally different experience: cabin nice and bright, seating comfortable with nice seat pitch and amazing inflight entertainment. My Asian vegetarian meal was excellent. A staff member from another part of the cabin served my meal. She spoke Slovenian and this was such a nice gesture. The whole cabin crew nice and professional.

My first time on Emirates, the A380 is a great plane to travel being spacious and quiet - I felt less fatigued than normal I think its spaciousness may be a factor - plenty of toilets and comfortable seats.

"  I flew with Emirates from Brisbane to London return via Dubai. The staff were sour, acting like my asking for a glass of water were a hassle, and the food was disgusting. But the flight over was nothing compared to the return journey. After not being notified that my flight was delayed due to a plane crash at Dubai airport (ever heard of email, Emirates?), I arrived at the airport to start my journey home and finally found someone to guide me to a customer service desk, where I was told of the delay and given a hotel and bus voucher. The customer service agent also told me that the next leg of my flight would be organised when I was in the air - someone would meet me at the gate (I scoffed at that one). Trying to get on the bus was like surviving a round of the hunger games, after an hour I gave up and caught a cab. After spending 14 hours in the hotel I thought I would be winging my way home. After finally arriving in Dubai, there was no one there to meet me at the gate so I proceeded to the transfer desk, where I was told by someone who had just been served that the queue wait time was 7 hours. So after waiting for 3 hours I found staff who told me that if my online booking had been updated with my next flight, then I shouldn't bother waiting in the queue as they weren't giving out hotel or meal vouchers. I checked online and found that I had indeed been put on a flight - scheduled to leave in 24 hours time. I settled in to spend 28 hours total in Dubai airport with the other people laying on pieces of cardboard and crates. On my return to Australia, Emirates refused any compensation for breaching their contract by not providing any accommodation or meal vouchers and now ""considered the matter closed"", refusing to respond to any further emails. So if you're looking to fly Emirates - beware! They may show you great service (which is a bit hit and miss anyway), but when things go wrong, they are unorganised and have no care for the people they serve or the inconvenience they cause.",Detractor

As a manager of a national football team travelling with a group of 29 and excess team luggage, it is important to check everyone through and verify the number of items and be able to cater to the oversize luggage such as physio tables and medical supplies.

They were very efficient, helpful and able to provide exit row seating for our three passengers who were 6 foot and over.

The seat/bed is spacious, stylish and comfortable. The selection of beverages and food average and the service on this flight, appalling. The staff made flying business feel like the new economy. They do not make eye contact, answer the call bell, return with requests (even if you ask four times at twenty minute intervals) or serve you breakfast if you ask not to be woken for it (regardless of your slumber status). They do: congregate in the guest onboard bar/lounge talking loudly in a manner that could lead you to believe they were having their own cocktail party.",Passive

I noticed that you have a bit more space for your legs than with some airlines, which made the flight a lot more comfortable. I was amazed by their IFE - so many movies, games, etc. I didn't use the WiFi. The flight attendants were really friendly and I enjoyed the fact that they have a crew on board that can speak so many languages. The food was also very good. One thing I thought was a bit annoying that you only have that big assortment of movies on the longest flights, so I could watch many more movies from Durban to Dubai than from Dubai to Brussels.

"  Dubai to New York JFK. This is our first time traveling in business class on an A380-800, when we first booked our tickets we specifically requested special assistance for my husband who is in the wheelchair and unable to stand. When we arrived at the check-in counter, we asked for confirmation that special assistant would be provided at the gate to help my husband board the aircraft using an isle chair. An hour before boarding we asked the agent on duty if they had all the necessary preparation that we had asked for. In all 3 instances we were assured that everything was under control. So we relax, believing that everything was under control. However when it came time to board we were forced to wait at the aircraft door until all passenger had been boarded because no preparation had been made to assist my husband into the aircraft. At this point the flight crew apologized to us for the confusion and inconvenience. After another 20 mins waiting we accessed the business class section on the upper deck using hilift truck (typically use for catering) from which we boarded the aircraft and were moved to our seat location. Unfortunately there were no moveable armrest on any of the business class seats that would enable a wheelchair bound passenger to transfer from the isle chair to the seat without risking injury. Fortunately my husband is strong enough to transfer over the arm rest without falling down or injuring himself (perhaps they are no fully accessible first or business class seats on Emirates), everything else from that point on until we disembarked was excellent! The aircrew were truly professional and made every effort to accommodate us. Hopefully our next trip with Emirates would be better experience. The weak link as always is the ground staff.

This as a concept works for a couple or single passenger but if your a elderly or a family this is a disaster.

"  Dubai to Perth. A new plane, nicely decorated and kitted out. The seats had a decent width and pitch and the IFE and onboard connectivity are always good. Unfortunately, the cushion and blanket are small, tatty and hardly comforting or warm. There was no drinks service until after the main meal was served. The selection of beverages was lacking and the quality of drinks seemed cheap. It was, however, the meal service that really stood out as a real disappointment. On this route we were to 'enjoy' two hot meals. I have included photos as I don't think I could adequately describe how bad these meals were in words alone. The best part of the whole meal service was looking around the cabin and seeing the faces of fellow passengers do the big unveil on their hot meals. Priceless! Luckily Emirates do provide cheese and crackers and chocolate to partly make up for the rest of the meal. The crew service was professional and generally friendly, but I feel like the crew are trying so hard to get the service right that they fail to engage with passengers. They appear unnatural and don't let their personalities shine through. The flight boarded quickly, took off on time and landed into Perth only a few minutes behind schedule.

I won't rate its service as good as its reputation. It is pretty poor actually. Secondly, during my whole itinerary, I had to take shuttle for at least 4 times. It was either from flight to terminal, or from terminal to flight. It's definitely not a pleasant experience because my wife and I had to wait in a jammed, hot bus, and the transit time was long.

No one even bothered to ask whether we need anything for the baby - when I asked a crew member I need to make formula for the baby she asked me to wait till the service over, that is for another half an hour. Can a baby wait like an adult. I wanted to wash her milk bottle and she asked me to go to the washroom. No helping hand at all. Luckily I had my parents with me to help.

Some of the cabins had the StarLight belongs only to Emirates - bringing a great mood in flight. Emirates, while being a great airline, has inconsistent cabin service onboard which is surprising. The ICE entertainment system was spectacular - the best in the skies. What I give it to Emirates for is their food and it's quality - marvelous! There are 3 meals on the 14 hour leg - in addition to main meals, there is a light bite service. Due to the lack of on demand dining, they have snacks in the galley in between for the hungry.

Service from Manila to Barcelona and Barcelona to Dubai was bad. No attendants doing the rounds to offer water or juice when meal service was long over. This was only done for the flight from Dubai to Manila. Meal was served very late - going 2 hours into the flight. Fancy packaging for some biscuits with cheese and salsa and tiny toasted bread but actually everything in that nice packaging does not taste good unless you are too hungry. Cod fish served over noodles was not fresh. The salads served were awful, and i'm not picky with food. This is the first time that I ever asked for noodles during any flight just because I ate so little on my tray. Very disappointed indeed.",Detractor
"  Kuala Lumpur to Dubai. Have flown Emirates numerous time over the last few months and been very happy with service, comfort and quality of food. This last trip was exceptional and I had to give a shout out to the cabin crew. We had one of the best travel experiences and we fly extensively throughout North America and UAE. I highly recommend Emirates.",Promoter
"Return Taipei - Amsterdam in business. Cabin crew and food very good. All flights on time, except for a slight delay in AMS due to a sick passenger. For Taipei, they use the China Airlines lounge in Terminal 1. It is interesting that in AMS they give you a choice of lounge use or a restaurant voucher. My biggest gripes were that the meal service seems to be really drawn out. Also, business class bags took a long time to come out in Taipei. Wifi was barely usable-not really worth USD 1.",Promoter
"  Doha to Bangkok via Dubai. We chose Emirates as the cost was reasonably good. Flight from Doha to Dubai was good, the time flown was just 45 minutes. We reached the Dubai Airport and purchased some Duty free and was little late to the boarding gate, but somehow managed to be there before 10 minutes. To our surprise at boarding both our tickets have been upgraded to Business Class. My first ever Business Class Experience. Loved the whole journey to Bangkok. The crew were very friendly and courteous. First time I had Champagne and a five star meal, received a grooming set as a compliment.",Promoter
"  Johannesburg to New York JFK via Dubai. There was a total of 7 of us travelling on 2 separate bookings (6 people on 1 booking, 1 on another). Our flights home beginning on August 3, 2016 had us travelling with British Airways, Emirates and JetBlue Airways. We had no issues with our flights on British Airways and Jet Blue. Our luck ran out upon dealing with Emirates for our return flight home. I called Emirates August 2, 2016 (24 hours prior to our flight) to request kids meals and a vegan meal for 3 of our passengers. While on the phone with the representative, I inquired on our current seating arrangements to ensure the children would be sitting with the adults in our party. When I provided the booking number for my husband, I was advised his ticket was cancelled. You can imagine my shock upon hearing this. I asked the representative why it was cancelled, who cancelled it and when. I was advised it was cancelled July 24 â€“ 1 day after we started travelling â€“ and 6 months after booking the flight. The representative advised Emirates cancelled the ticket as they saw 2 tickets for a Brett Hale. My son's name is BH Jr and my husband is BH. There is no space to enter a suffix within the Travelocity website. However, it is noted that one ticket was a child's ticket and one was for an adult. In addition, I had to input the date of birth for each traveler.I never once received a phone call or email from Emirates to confirm I did in fact book a duplicate ticket. And I did not receive a refund for the cost of a ticket that they cancelled. After the representative informed me that Emirates made the error in cancelling my husband's booking, I requested his ticket to be reinstated as it was, so we would all be travelling together. I was told that the second leg was full and that wasn't an option. While informing the representative that that was not acceptable and that Emirates needed to find a way to ensure my husband was travelling with us, I was told he would send an email on an â€œUrgent Basisâ€ and someone would be in touch with me. At this point, it is 7pm and the first leg of our flight home (via British Airways) is at 8am. I had been on the phone with him for over an hour. We were in a game reserve in the middle of South Africa and my cell phone did not have service. He advised I could try calling back in an hour. Long story short, it took over 4 hours and multiple phone calls to multiple people to get his ticket reinstated. Even then, I was not confident he would be flying home with us. I was extremely dissatisfied with the level of customer service and how they handle their own errors.",Detractor
"  Mauritius to Dubai. Our problems began with the meal service. We waited nearly half an hour from first to main course, but it was when the main course arrived that things really went downhill. The menu promised ""Braised beef brisket served in a rich jus with mashed potatoes and turned root vegetables"". What was served up with a barely warm meal with a dried up chunk of meat minus any jus. Judge for yourself from the photo. When I drew the attention of one of the cabin crew to this, she apologised and said she would find out what had gone wrong and come back to me. 20 minutes went by with no one coming back, so I pressed the call button, which was completely ignored (this in itself is worrying as it may have been an urgent matter that needed crew attention). I finally collared the purser as he was passing, got another apology and an explanation that all the beef meals were minus the sauce and offer of the same again but heated up. When I declined, explained that my partner and I were allergic to fish ruling that alternative out and didn't like curry, the other alternative, he said he would go away and see what else he could come up with. Five minutes later and the offer was beneath contempt - the purser brought the fish and curry meals I'd already rejected and two other dried up meals from economy. He then, very reluctantly said he'd see if there was anything else available from first class and claimed that they had the same meals so there was nothing he could do. I decided to pass and go the the sweet course (15 minutes waiting for that) while my partner decided not to eat at all. For the remainder of the flight, the cabin crew did their best to ignore us, or when they had to interact, their manner was off hand to say the least. Customer focus was lacking completely. The purser came past later and apologised but sincerity was lacking completely. About 30 minutes from landing, my partner pressed the call button to request the return of his jacket which had been hung up. Again, the call button was ignored completely. This was the worst flight I have had. By contrast, the connecting flight from Dubai to Manchester had an outstanding cabin crew and provided a superb flight experience. However, this is not the first time I've found a lack of consistency with Emirates, but it will be the last time. I will never fly with them again and I would recommend others to choose another airline.",Detractor
"  Emirates has lost it's edge with series of unnecessary changes over the last few years. If traveling to first world destinations, Emirates provide their latest aircraft, with state of the art features and polished services. However, take a flight to a not so developed destination and you are better off flying one of the budget airlines in the sector as there isn't much difference between the services and a whole lot to gain in the price. Flying to London heathrow on their A380 you would expect the best and unfortunately it failed to impress. Had previously enjoyed Emirates design and layout of the A380 but having flown recently, it seems they've tried to save up on costs with reduced spacing between seats with thinner cushions. Emirates staffs feel more likes nannies than polished butlers. Although they speak more than a dozen languages and look fashionably tailored, that's where it ends. An economy return ticket from Dubai to London was priced at a whopping 1200 GBP when other airlines were much cheaper. The only advantage I saw in paying so much was that it was a direct flight and I didn't have any lengthy layovers. One would expect that after having checked in online a baggage drop would be quite a simple task and hardly time consuming. However, it seemed like the baggage drop lines were bigger than regular Check in queues and I don't really find much of a differences in what the staff were doing in the check in counters and baggage drop counters. Overall, I am quite disappointed with Emirates and next time I fly this sector, I might seriously consider other airlines.",Detractor

Good leg room on this plane and the video on demand is excellent although screen significantly more responsive on the newer and larger product on both the DXB to/from BKK legs.

"  Milan to New York and Rome to Bangkok via Dubai. I've been flying with Emirates for the last 3 years during holidays. I have flown several times both in Economy and Business Class. I have flown in Business Class both on the Airbus A380-800 and the Boeing 777-300ER. Business Class is way better on the A380-800, where you get a lot of privacy (specially in windows seats), great food and a great service. Business Class is good enough in the 777-300ER, but you don't get a lot of privacy and the seats are angled lie-flat, so not as comfortable. Emirates Economy Class, specially on board of the A380-800, is one of the best in the world. I have flown for years with Lufthansa in Economy Class, and Emirates beats it hands down. The PTV screens are huge, there is a good amount of space, the plane is really quiet, and the service is better than on Lufthansa. What I mostly liked about Economy Class, apart from the IFE is the fact that they don't bring your food in hot aluminium trays, but in hard plastic, that is much better looking. In Economy Class, you also have the possibility to see the menu and they pass with drinks many many times.",Promoter
"For my first flight on Emirates, it was fabulous. Even though the flight left at 2.40am (which meant we had to sit around in Melbourne Airport for 7 hours, as we arrived from Wellington), the crew made it bearable. They were attentive, friendly and helpful. The flight was operated by a newish 777-300ER (A6-ENG) which was great. The ICE system was faultless, which on top of the generous size of the screens made the flight fly by. The seat size is a problem however, the 3-4-3 configuration is just mean. But the foot room was better than any other economy class. The food on-board was very average for Economy, as a small snack was provided after take-off and then before landing a large Breakfast was served. I also really liked the fact that the crew handed out hot towels and face wipes before takeoff and before landing. An added bonus was the great (but understandably slow) Wi-Fi, a first for me on a plane. All in all, I would definitely fly again, which I will be in April, but this time on an A380, which should be excellent.",Promoter

"  Upgraded to First private suites on Brussels to Dubai using 777-300ER. A very agreable flight of course, but with a long series of problems that should not occur. After take-off, the seat could only operated through the large TV touch screen, not through the remotes, which is a bit painful as the creen is about 1m from the seat. This was fixed after 15 min. Then the TV screen started going black for 30sec every 10min while the soundtrack of the movie still played. The system was reset and then worked fine. Although only 3 people travelling in the First class cabin, crew brought a wrong entree, and insisted it was the right one even it was obviously not the case. After 10 min they apologized, and offered to cook the right one but this took another 30 min. Halfway through the flight the seat completely jammed, but I could easily pick another one as the cabin was less than half full. I must say Emirates' first class seat is in fact worse than their lie flat business class seats on the A380s. Upon arrival in Dubai, I used Emirates chauffeur service, was assigned one of their cars but the driver told me he didn't know the (Meydan) hotel and asked whether I could guide him. Which I could not, so I asked for another car and driver, and left the car. But the organizers of the service on the pavement insisted I wait until they explained the route to follow to the driver. I did not want to wait at midnight with 36C temperature outside, and only after insisting really hard did they call another driver.",Passive
"  Manchester to Tokyo Narita via Dubai. First leg from Manchester to Dubai was very good in A380 with good legroom and excellent inflight cabin service. However, WiFi did not work. Boeing 777-300 from Dubai to Narita was very cramped. Emirates have taken off 1 inch from each seat to squeeze additional one seat in a 3-4-3 configuration. This makes the seating very uncomfortable. ICE system did not work very well. Return journey from Osaka to Dubai was also bad. Boeing 777-300 cabin had a dated look. Seating very uncomfortable. My seat did not recline. Passenger sitting next to me had to move as that seat would not recline either. Toilets were dirty and had no water in the basin to wash hands. Cabin crew very slow in serving any foods/drinks. It took over three hours before any drinks or food was served after departure. Headphones did not work properly. Had to try 3 different headphones before I found one that worked. Airbus A380 from Dubai to Manchester was fine. I will avoid flying on Emirates Boeing 777-300 to Japan in future.",Passive

I waited over 15 minutes to use a toilet in business and then one of the hostesses came out with her makeup bag (there was a line for both toilets). Service so slow and they act like they are doing you a favour. I asked for a red wine and got a cup of tea! When I mentioned this I still did not get the red. Two Sauvignon blancs is not smart for a choice of white wines. On board ICE entertainment system clumsy.

"  Melbourne to Kuala Lumpur. I was disappointed the staff were not friendlier during check-in. One of the best business class lounges, food, alcohol and facilities are great. Staff are the same as every other lounge. Service In Flight: The first time in my experience of flying business class that I was not greeted with a welcome drink, while other people in the cabin received it. I had a feeling of unwelcomeness from the staff - an overall indifference. The only thing premium is the menu and not necessarily the service. I think the diversity of their crew is the biggest problem. There is no cohesive identity and embedded culture of service and welcoming. Even having to press the call button twice on a few occasions to receive service. Food quality varied - some were delicious, the others not. Seating was very uncomfortable. I was reconsidering my decision to upgrade. I couldn't sleep properly as I am a side sleeper.

Also past few trips on Emirates they always have shortfall of water bottles even after 3 hours of take off and their food choices have gone so commercial and reminds me of cheap United Airlines food - specially the light bite and they should stop serving this uncooked doughy pizza. The flight manager never showed up in the cabin, usually they always come and greet their Gold and Platinum members.",Passive
"  Birmingham to Colombo via Dubai with Emirates. Poor throughout, specially onboard food and service which is what I thought Emirates was renowned for and worth paying extra for. Birmingham to Dubai we had the A380 which was very comfortable with seats that I could sit cross-legged on. The entertaintment system was also amazing. This is where the positives end as the boarding of this flight took so long that there was an hour delay to take off. The organisation for transfers was poor to non-existent with a massive queue for security at Dubai with minimal time for the connection. For the rest of our flights, Dubai to Sri Lanka, Sri Lanka to Dubai with a stop at Male and Dubai to Birmingham, we had the smaller and older aircraft B777-300. This was noticably older, dated and uncomfortably cramped. The entertainment screens poor quality in comparison. The worst of all was the inflight service. Pressed my buzzer for help with a non-functioning screen and an hour later, nobody had come to ask what I needed. In the end, I had to keep pressing the buzzer continuously about 15 times before someone came to us. I had no entertainment for the duration of 2.5 hours. It only took 5 minutes to fix when they actually got round to it. The food and beverage service also poor. They had a choice of fish or chicken but by the time they got to aisle 23, they had completely run out of chicken. I offered to wait till the end of service to see if any was left. I was told categorically there was none left and then later I saw them handing chicken to some passengers. On the 8-hour flight from Dubai to Birmingham, after an hour on the plane before take off and an hour on the bus waiting to board the plane, apart from the little tub of water with the snack and breakfast, no drinks runs to even offer people water. On walking around, I saw all the service staff at the back of the plane with tea and biscuits having a good old jolly. Overall, a very disappointing experience, completely unexpected from an airline with the reputation of Emirates.",Detractor
"Milan Malpensa to New York JFK with Emirates. The A380 is a beautiful plane, and the version that Emirates has outfitted is a little to flashy for my taste, fake wood and gold trim. The seats are great, lie flat with direct aisle access, the ICE inflight entertainment has a mind boggling array of movies and shows from every corner of the planet. Comfort of the bed was OK, a little more padding would be nice. They provide you with a mattress and blanket, which helps. Seat 14K has direct window access with storage against the wall which was great. Boarding directly from the lounge at Malpensa was really nice, I love the inflight bar in the back. The food was good, not great, I've had just as good food on domestic USA first class, although not as plentiful as I received on Emirates. A couple of glitches. The FA's completely forgot to serve me my main course, I had to ask after everyone was served. Very apologetic and kind apology from the FA. Next I wasn't served my dessert, I was dozing, that was OK. However I was offered a choice of desserts and the wrong one was brought to me. I expected a little more polish. The free limo service home is awesome. Also the agent at the lounge at Malpensa was really great, made sure we were checked in, confirmed the limo in New York.",Passive

"  Flew Rio de Janeiro to Buenos Aires with Emirates. At Rio International Airport Emirates use the Gol Lounge. This is a simple lounge with no frills. The food and drinks were poor and the seating not very good. The Emirates ground staff kept Business and First class passengers queuing at the boarding gate for some time while some ""priority"" economy passengers boarded - I have never seen this before. Even when allowed to board the problem was that economy passengers had to come through the Business Class cabin, so stowing hand luggage etc. became a problem as to do so meant blocking the aisles while these passengers were trying to get past. The aircraft had a very tired feel and look. The seat layout in the Business Class cabin was 2-3-2 which made leaving your seat if you were not on the aisle a problem. The cabin staff were good and efficient. The food was possibly the worst I have ever had on any Business Class flight. Although there was supposedly Wi-Fi available I was never able to connect to it. I didn't really use the in-flight entertainment much but it was a little awkward and fiddly with a strange ""tablet"" type control which didn't seem to control anything.",Passive

Rudeness from Emirate ground staff, all we were given were muffins juice and water for sustenance. Not a single Emirates employee made an announcement to make sense of the chaos nor where there any notices or communications.

"London Heathrow to Dhaka via Dubai flying with Emirates in economy class. There was a long line at check in at LHR Terminal 3. Security was smooth, though. There are a range of big brand duty-free shops at T3 so that was a bonus. Then boarding came. In my personal opinion, Emirates should have extra boarding time for bigger planes like the A380s as the long line resulted in a delay of 1 hour. After boarding, I checked out our seats. The seats are comfortable with adequate leg-room. The IFE System was clearly bigger and better than the last time we flew with Emirates. The flight was smooth as usual with EK and the meal was very delicious with now more bigger portions. We safely landed at Dubai International Airport at Terminal 3. It was very hard, though to find out where flight connections were as two signs led to different places. The shops at Dubai were even better with more choices of retail. Soon after the short wait we boarded the Boeing 777-300ER from Dubai to Dhaka, in Bangladesh. The seating was mostly the same but had smaller IFE Systems like old Emirates and the touchscreen response was poorly. They managed to maintain the plane cleanliness quite well. The food was more than shocking on this one. Nevertheless we had another smooth flight to Dhaka. On both flights the cabin crew were outstanding and were kind and polite. At Dhaka our baggage took at least two hours to come even though in the domestic terminal we had another flight with a different airline 2 and a half hours after landing.

"  The car arrived at our Singapore lodgings in fine time, and we were soon on our way to Changi, where we arrived in time for a very fine breakfast in the First/Business Lounge. We were welcomed aboard our 777, with the usual courtesy, but my infotainment screen wouldn't work. Attempts to re-boot failed. Fortunately there were empty seats with working screens so I moved. All went well until the pilot announced we were about to commence our descent into Dubai. I switched to the 'flight details' on the screen of my 'new' seat. Without warning the 'destination' changed from 'Dubai' to 'Sharjah'. Ten minutes later the pilot announced that we would indeed be going to 'Sharjah', and another ten minutes later we indeed landed at Sharjah. Our 777 'parked' alongside several others, in a secluded corner of the airport. Hours passed. We weren't allowed to leave the plane. Information was hard to come by from the crew, but someone with contacts in Dubai learned on his mobile phone that there had been a serious incident at Dubai which closed the airport. Without warning buses arrived, and we were asked to board them. It looked like the bus depot rejects had been mobilised. We found ourselves in a minibus which had definitely seen better days. It did have air con but I made the mistake of sitting in the front over the engine, which gave out more heat than the air con gave cool. We set out, we knew not for where, in a convoy with police escort. After many stops and starts, we eventually arrived at what appeared to be the 'employees' entrance of Dubai airport. A man in white robes and a baseball cap then appeared to assume responsibility for our 'convoy'. With much gesticulating he seemed to instruct the drivers of the buses in our convoy to follow him. He drove an ordinary saloon car, with a yellow flashing light on top through a security gate, and our convoy of barely street legal buses followed him 'airside'. Eventually, driving by parked planes, and other 'airside' traffic, we came to an 'arrival gate', we were only too pleased to leave the oven-hot interior of the mini bus for the air conditioned splendour of the main terminal building at Dubai. Imagine our delight when we saw that the 15.00 hrs departure for Glasgow had not yet left. It was now about 19.30hrs. The 'departures screen' announced 'Gate Open', so we made our way there and checked in. The Emirates staff in attendance couldn't tell us when the delayed flight might actually depart, but they did advise that we should stand by. Eventually the flight was boarded, and took off at about 21.30hrs. Six and a half hours late. The flight was incident free, although again I couldn't make the 'infotainment' system work, and we landed at Glasgow at 01.45hrs on Thursday 4th August 2016, just under six hours behind schedule. Our bags of course were still in the Middle East, so carrying practically nothing we went to get our chauffeur car home. The final indignity. They had given 'our' car to someone in greater need, we would have to make do with a complimentary local taxi. So ever so jet lagged, a taxi, nearly as grotty as the Sharjah mini bus, but not so hot, delivered us home in the wee small hours of the morning. Actually less than six hours behind schedule was so much better than I feared when we first diverted to Sharjah. We were reunited with our luggage during the evening of Friday 5th August, when a driver brought them to our home. A journey memorable for all the wrong reasons.",Detractor
"  We chose Emirates to fly Manila to Boston and then back to Manila from JFK International. Our flight to Boston was pretty good, except that my seat and my cousin's seat cannot be reclined, so we weren't able to sleep well, it was very uncomfortable. I think they should do something about it knowing that long haul flights are very tiring. Now, our flight back from JFK int'l airport to Manila, is very much a hassle . We were only told that the flight was delayed for 5 hours exactly during check in time (instead of 11:20am, it became 4:30 in the afternoon) which obviously made us upset plus the fact that nobody is explaining why it was delayed. It's a good thing though that they already allowed us to check in our luggage. However we needed to line up at the Check-in counter for an hour and 30 minutes. It was also disappointing that when waiting on the line, almost all the counters prioritized the Business class passengers. The flight however had a late boarding, it was supposed to board at 3:30 but they started boarding at 4:30. Our co-passengers have become impatient. We all crowded the boarding gate. Why? No one announced what's happening. I asked the ground personnel, what time are they boarding but her answer is just ""in a few minutes"". What the heck, you let us wait for 5 hours and more and you cannot tell us specific answers. And now we have to wait for 12 hours for our flight to Manila. We're supposed to be back to work by tomorrow. Please give fair treatment to all your passengers. The reason for delays must be explained.",Passive
"  Dubai to Auckland via Melbourne with Emirates. Sat in window seat 19J (aisle), my husband in sat in window seat behind that was more private. Very pleasant and efficient crew who served meals fast. Emirates did not have any women's amenity kits onboard, so I received a men's one. Some of the passengers in middle rows had seats that were malfunctioning and would not recline, I felt very sorry for them, at the start of a 14.5 hour flight when you've paid a lot of extra dollars for a lie flat seat, that isn't very good. Our previous flight which was shorter had the same issues with seats. Business class was full on this flight, so no way to move seats. Seats are comfy enough with the mattress topper but a little on the short side for me. Much room is devoted to the minibar at the side of your seat, I would rather have a wider seat, the drinks are not chilled either, so I just got chilled drinks / water from the bar. Good selection of movies and TV shows etc. The bar was fabulous, I woke up early (3am) and had a coffee. Could not fault the attentive and very helpful staff, any problems were due to lack of maintenance of seats and ground crew not loading amenity kits.",Passive
"  Flew Amsterdam - Dubai - Dar es Salaam with Emirates. In Amsterdam our flight was already delayed 3.5 hrs which left us 30 minutes to make our transfer in Dubai. Upon arrival in Dubai, we could not disembark for another 15-20 minutes. After running through Dubai airport we arrived at our gate to be the last passengers boarding to Dar Es Salaam. Hungry and thirsty we entered the plane. The personnel aboard seemed very reluctant and after calling the stewardess to ask for some water they just did not come. Having travelled for 22 hours, all Emirates served us were 2 meals and a couple of drinks, but the worst was yet to come. Upon arrival to Dar Es Salaam, the luggage was lost. It's 4 days later and still we have not heard anything from them.",Detractor
"  This was my third trip with Emirates from London to Bangkok via Dubai, and first in Business, having been fortunate to fly in first on the previous two trips. Emirates is still one of the few airlines to offer a courtesy chauffeur service at selected airports, this is a huge cost saving and always appreciated. The moment you board the plane, you get the feeling that your custom is valued, that every effort will be made to make your journey as comfortable and enjoyable as possible. The seats are spacious and luxurious. The choice of beverages superb, the bar at the back of the cabin an excellent escape, and great opportunity to socialise with other passengers and cabin crew. The dining option was a decent choice, and as good as you'd expect if you were dining out. Travelling on an airline like Emirates is always the perfect way to bookend a trip, and I look forward to future travels with them.",Promoter
"  Manchester to Dubai with Emirates. Having just got off the flight from hell, I feel a few words are in order. There were real problems and long lines boarding the A380 in Manchester and this was not well handled. The food when we got it was cold and a 7 hour flight only provided one meal? The paying passengers seemed to be a inconvenience to the cabin staff - very slow and poor service and they never smiled or interacted. You press the call bell and wait and wait and wait. Then get out of your seat and go and find them. This is not the sort of service I expected and if this had of been my first flight with them I would never have used them again. I have been flying with them and other airlines for 20 years. I shall be using them in the future as I have never had a problem like this before but would not again fly in a A380 from Manchester.",Detractor
"  Gatwick to Brisbane via Dubai. Appalling service from Emirates. I had my business class flight cancelled and resold whilst I was on my connecting flight. I was only informed of this seconds before boarding despite being checked in. I was told I would have to fly the following day as I sat with a leg injury in a wheelchair! I asked if any first class seats were available as I cannot bend my knee. I was told both business and first class were full. This was not the case, after arguing my case with a member of airport staff, I was given a business class seat and it's occupant was bumped up to first class! I cannot believe I was lied to and that given that Emirates had sold my ticket to someone else they did not just offer me the first class seat. Instead leaving me upset and distressed in the airport. Since then they have lost my luggage. $6,900 was paid for my flights. Emirates, what are you playing at?",Detractor

On both flights, service not too good. Although we reserved a bassinet in advance, we still had to request it inflight. Irritating policy on serving food. Travelling alone so I requested that they serve my food later as my baby was asleep on my lap but they declined due to policy. Suggested to put my food tray on the floor which is ridiculous. Other airlines like SQ are more flexible on such requests. No food served for babies even if you ask. Lastly, difficult to get help when asking assistance with my baby's milk. I had to carry my baby and go all the way to the pantry to get someone to assist me.",Passive

"  Perth to Dubai. I booked my ticket through Qantas for a route serviced by Emirates. At the check in, Emirates staff was not able to locate me in their system. Instead of clearing the issue with Qantas themselves, I had to go and talk to Qantas and forward Qantas message to Emirates, because according to Emirates (expressed in pretty arrogant way) I booked the ticket with Qantas and thus it is up to me to clear it. For me as a customer it does not make sense, as I would expect the airline to clear the issues they have with their internal systems themselves and not make the customer to try and resolve it at the airport, a couple of hours before the departure. Once the issue was resolved, the seat I originally booked, was also changed (from aisle to the window). Of course it is a small thing, but in the circumstances, it was annoying, as I particularly booked a seat at the aisle feeling unwell before the trip.",Detractor

"  Gatwick to Kolkata via Dubai, with a stopover of around 1 hr 30 mins in Dubai. Mobile boarding pass for both legs issued at the time of on line check in. Only reaching Gatwick at the time of depositing my check-in luggage I was told due to bad weather at Dubai, the incoming flight was delayed, consequently the flight from Gatwick will be delayed by 1 hour, meaning I will not be able to travel on my scheduled flight from Dubai to Kolkata - but have been rebooked on the next flight departing Dubai more than 12 hours later. There were at least 1 flight from Gatwick, and 2 flights from Heathrow that departed earlier than the 13:35 flight I was travelling, and if I was put on any of these flight I could have comfortably connected to my original DXB-Kolkata flight. Despite 1 hour delay in LGW-DXB flight, there was still 30 mins before my original DXB-CCU flight was due to depart, and I offered to travel on my original flight with my hand luggage only â€“ the checked in luggage can arrive in a later flight, and I can return to the Kolkata airport to collect my checked in luggage. I was only told everything is being done as per Airlines policies. (One of the ground staff started choreographing what fog looks like and why it is difficult for a pilot to fly through fog). Flight EK016 arrived in DXB around 1:25am, but I had to ask 4 different airline staff before gaining an understanding that I need to contact the transfer desk. It took me 17 mins in the queue at the transfer desk before I could reach the front, by which time the connecting Kolkata flight (departinf 02:00 hrs) was gone. I even proposed that I be allowed to travel to any other city e.g. Mumbai or Delhi, and be given a ticket on any domestic airlines from Mumbai/Delhi to Kolkata (or cash instead), but was told this was not possible. My only option is to travel by the later flight departing around 12 hrs later. So I had to hang around for the next 12 hours at the Dubai airport. My London to Gatwick flight was protected by EU Regulations, but the connecting flight from Dubai to Kolkata was not, despite travelling on the same ticket so I could not claim compensation under EU Regulations. I understand the airlines has not anything legally wrong, but otherwise did not find any redeeming feature in Airlines handling of the issue, let alone appreciation of the inconvenience caused.",Detractor
"  Dubai to Tokyo Narita. During the flight, I wanted to buy some duty free products. I asked three times, and each time the cabin attendant told me that the person dealing with duty free goods would come along shortly, but never did. After the third attempt, I gave up. What annoyed me more was that the breakfast service was cancelled due to turbulence, after the special meals were already handed out during the same turbulence! I had recently experienced more severe turbulence over the Atlantic, and the in flight service was not cancelled on that occasion (different airline). So I had to look on enviously at some of my fellow passengers while my own stomach was grumbling. In the end, I arrived in Tokyo after a 9 hour flight extremely hungry and with a back ache (seats seemed to be made of cardboard). The only positive thing about the flight was the in flight entertainment, which included wifi and live tv. That, however, is not enough to convince me to fly on Emirates with my own money again, particularly as I paid a 25% premium to fly on Emirates this time. Very disappointed.",Detractor
"Dublin to Manila via Dubai. As a frequent flyer on this route but typically with Etihad, I was booked with Emirates by a colleague who heard good things about the airline. Unfortunately this proved to not be my experience. When you fly long haul as often as I do the one thing that really matters is the seat - that's what I'm paying for. I don't believe I have experienced a more uncomfortable seat ever. Not flatbed but angled - no comfort in any position left me arriving with back pain and exhausted by lack of sleep. Unfortunately I get to enjoy it all again on the return trip in 10 days. The food was pretty awful also. Firmly back to Etihad for me and my team in future.",Detractor

Straight to the LHR EK Lounge which was very well serviced and enjoyed very good pre-boarding dinner for what was the last evening departure to DXB. Boarding direct from lounge a real bonus with EK. A380 full as ever, but enjoyed a couple of hours at the bar before grabbing some good rest. Arrival at DXB gate delayed due to a ground issue, but crew kept us informed. DXB can prove a little tiresome as its so big. An hour in the lounge allowed a chance to grab some breakfast and a shower before boarding for CPT.

"  Buenos Aires to Dubai via Rio de Janeiro. Perfect flight in Emirates First Class. This was a long flight, with a 3 hour leg to Rio, a transit stop and then a 14 hour haul from Rio to Dubai. I was the only passenger in First on the initial sector, and there were 2 of us on the second. Service was exemplary - warm, attentive and professional. The suite on the 777 is just as spacious as on the A380 and immaculately clean and shiny. As ever I enjoyed the mini bar, treat basket, beautiful amenity kit, writing set, and wonderfully soft pyjamas and slippers. I was able to get a great sleep. Food and beverage quality and quantity, as ever on Emirates, was First Class. Dom Perignon champagne, vintage fine wines, 40 year old port, ultra premium cognac. Wifi worked well and was available throughout the flight for just $1, not the rip-off charges on some competitors (Etihad and Qatar for example) We arrived early, luggage delivery was super fast and I was soon in my Mercedes limo and being whisked home. An outstanding flight experience and actually good value for money, considering the reasonable price paid. Highly recommended.",Promoter
"  Manchester to Dubai in Business Class. An excellent experience from start to finish. Chauffeur drive pick up worked perfectly and check in was very quick. I was seated in my pre-booked aisle seat in the 777-300ER which serves the morning flight from Manchester (the other 2 flights are operated by an A380). Fast track security worked like a dream. Within 10 minutes of arriving at the airport I was seated in Emirates' excellent lounge enjoying an outstanding breakfast, as good as you will experience in the best 5 star hotels: cut fresh fruits, eggs benedict, stuffed field mushrooms, grilled tomatoes, warm bread and croissants. There were a selection of freshly squeezed juices and smoothies, but I opted for a glass of Veuve Cliquot champagne. Boarding was on time and we were soon seated with a friendly welcome and another glass of champagne. The business seat on the 777 is a little narrower than on the A380, but still very comfortable and it reclines to a lie flat bed, with nice new design duvet. Service throughout the flight was perfect with very good crew visibility and a purser who really was outstanding and lead by example. We enjoyed drinks and nuts (Emirates makes a very good Mojito), then a 5 course lunch, with light bites or afternoon tea served before landing. The inflight entertainment is of course very good, although unfortunately there was no WIFI or live TV on this 777. We arrived on time and were soon disembarked. I had collected my luggage, done some duty free shopping and was in my limo within 40 minutes of touch down. Outstanding business class experience in all aspects.",Promoter

Seats were a little narrow and widthways was restricted, nowhere to rest your elbows unless you used the bulkheads on either side, The floor ahead of the seat had a ridge in it which made it uncomfortable to stretch your legs out. Plane was 30 minutes late leaving due to one runway being out of use. Cabin service was very poor and disjointed. Starters were served and the mains did not arrive for twenty minutes. We were not offered tea or coffee after the meal and had to ask twice for it to be served, I gave up in the end. Times must be hard on Emirates",Passive

One major annoyance was the removable tablet on the seat frame which got in the way of my left arm and which restricted movement.

The seat configuration in this aircraft is 2-3-2 which I personally think was quite strange since many airlines around the world have installed 1-2-1 arrangement in business class for large airplane types. The seats recline to almost 180 degree flat which are quite comfortable. The stewardesses were more hospitable compared to their male compatriot. When I asked for some more water to be filled up in my empty glass, he kept showing me the already provided bottle of water. Before landing all business class passengers were given express cards for being used at the immigration counters. All in all we were quite happy flying with Emirates.",Promoter

Food for such an airline miserable, with totally tasteless shrimps, and no fantasy in the menu at all. Seat not very comfortable: because of the removable screen controller, less space for elbow. Interesting also to note that all Emirates pictures show business class cabins in 2-2-2 configuration, never in 2-3-2.",Promoter

Onboard the service feels entirely scripted lacking any sense of personality or personalisation. The business class lounge in Dubai is akin to warehousing premium passengers - a cavernous space with no redeeming features. There was nothing good about this experience. And a queue of 10 for the rest room in a supposed premium lounge area? Really? This is not a premium experience, period. Thankfully I only to have to endure EK on a bi-annual basis.

Now our little one has had to go shopping while very tired to get the basics. Come on Emirates, get into gear.",Detractor
"  Manchester to Kuala Lumpur via Dubai. These were our first Emirates flights. Excellent cabin crew, friendly, attentive and happy to engage with the passengers. Both aircraft were very comfortable, but we prefer the extra smoothness and comfort of the A380. For a couple we recommend the central pair of seats which are positioned together with the mini bar section between the seats and the aisle. The wine selection was excellent and food very tasty and of a high standard. Regular supplies of hot towel throughout the two seven hour flights. The only negative was that I struggled to get the wifi set up, but that is probably down to my ineptitude. I could have requested help there but I didn't as I was into a film at that point. The Emirates lounge at Manchester was very good and is soon to be updated we were told. We were very impressed with the food in all the lounges we used, the KUL lounge was excellent too. There very good quality wines, coffee etc on offer in each lounge. Prior to these Emirates flights our most recent business class flights were from LHR terminal 5 and BA, Emirates offering is many levels higher than our experience there.",Promoter
"  Emirates just won my worst airline experience. I was supposed to fly the simple Manila-Dubai-Washington route. But instead, I got Manila-Clark airport transfer via bus to get us on a plane there. We then were asked to wait without a clear departure time. Eventually, we left at 2AM after a 8 hour delay. Then they put me on a Dubai-London flight. When asked why this is the case, they tell me that I will fly to London and then wait for another transfer to get on Washington DC flight. Already exhausted finding our bags then moving the bags with us to a different airport and then waiting 8 hours, I told them I just want to wait for the next direct flight to Washington. They tell me I need to talk to the guys in Dubai for they can't do anything. But then upon checking, I find that I have an hour or so to move to the transit gate. At this time, I have no idea when I will arrive in London or Washington. I am now sitting at the Dubai airport to find out that I will have to wait another 4 hours in London. And they are announcing the flight to London need to be boarded. Since my luggage is already tagged through these stops, I am waiting at the gate. But I have to say this is horrible. More so since no Emirates representative is offering an explanation why these arrangements were made.

I left DUB on the late evening flight, supposed to leave at 22.25 but was delayed by 30mins or so because of an off load. Getting to the airport and similarly, on return, the chauffeur pick up worked extremely efficiently. Emirates is still, unfortunately, using the the DAA lounge in DUB. I had hoped, 2 years ago, that when they went to 2 flights per day, they would have their own lounge, like Etihad, but we can still hope. The DAA lounge is extremely basic, with no added frills. I flew in First with Emirates, DUB/DXB/BNE. Then transferring to Qantas Business for the Domestic connection to TSV.

"Difficult to fault, although I felt the cabin crew on the Delhi - Dubai (777-300ER) flight had an edge to them, attentive as soon as you board, called you by your name, introduce themselves and have a chat. Very welcoming. The upper deck of the A380 has so many cabin crew, they say hello as your go to your seat but then stand around for a long time before fully engaging, they seem to engage with each other more than the passengers. This is only an observation, but I have noticed it on a previous flight as well. Catering was very good from Delhi - Dubai, very good Indian meal, and Arab Mezze, lots of drinks offered and a beautiful Mango Mousse for desert. Cannot fault ICE the Emirates in flight entertainment system, its got an absolutely monster choice of movies / albums, more than enough, it took me ages to choose my movie as the selection was so good. Catering from Dubai to London, was OK, some sandwiches after take off which was early morning, were not particularly fresh, where as if you go back to the bar area the food there looked a lot more enticing (and fresh). I asked to borrow a pen, 5 times from the cabin crew to fill out my breakfast form, eventually had to go back to the bar to borrow one from the bar tender. Breakfast was good, and served just before landing at Gatwick. The A380 is a beautiful aircraft and just seems to float, little turbulence was felt, and the cabin / seats were superb. Strangely given the choice I would take the Boeing 777-300ER purely because the crew seem to be more on the ball, but overall the Emirates experience was very very good. Landing at Gatwick means quite a walk over the large bridge to get to the main terminal, assume due to the assigned parking areas for the A380. Bag was lost on arrival, no fault of Emirates, someone walked off with it by mistake, but Emirates were very helpful contacting the passenger who was on the M25 and had to bring my bag back - unbelievable.",Promoter

Old generation ICE, no working power supply (at the time). 2hrs in Tunis - you are not allowed to disembark the aircraft and for the first hour are vigorously encouraged to remain in your seat while headcounts, security formalities are completed. Having just endured a 6-hr flight and probably a couple of hours in Dubai before the flight - and in need of a stretch, drink and to freshen up - it was frustrating not to receive better on-ground 'transit' care.

  My first time flying Emirates Business on A380 from Dubai to Manchester. I was impressed from the start. Went up to the business lounge - lots of comfortable seating and delicious food and drink available. Went straight to airplane from lounge. My seat was at the back of the section. There was a male passenger in the seat over the aisle and I must admit I felt very exposed and too close to him. Luckily there were several empty seats so I moved to a window seat - this time seat over aisle was unoccupied. Seat was very easy to move and very comfortable. Later I was offered a mattress but didn't need it. Staff very pleasant and helpful although during the flight I did ask for a drink of hot water which I never received. Meal served on white cloth. China by Royal Doulton. It felt lovely to drink out of a porcelain mug. Food was ok - better than Economy of course. I was able to have my choice but I think I chose wrongly. Later I had afternoon tea - bread had dried out but fillings very pleasant - much better than economy's which are sometimes inedible. Nice big screen to watch. I visited the bar area which was fun.

"  Perth to Prague via Dubai with Emirates on Qantas tickets to get the QF points and status credits. We always work this way. Typical Emirates business class, that is to say pretty much as good as you can get. The A380 from Perth to Dubai was a very early model and starting to show its age, but still everything was up to standard and sleep was easy. New Perth lounge does get a bit crowded when the A380 is leaving and lack of pyjamas on overnight flight a minor issue, but still would not fly with anyone else to Europe.",Promoter
"  Have flown Amsterdam to Dubai roundtrips with Emirates A380s since they started the route. Seat, IFE and overall cabin comfort remain top in class. Catering has recently improved, quality of the FAs is still erratic, but Emirates find it increasingly difficult to depart on time, both in AMS and DXB. When departure is delayed by more than 45min it is not possible to catch-up during the flight as the sector is not long enough. Turnaround time in Amsterdam is very short, and thus departure time suffers quickly when the inbound flight is delayed. Not sure why leaving Dubai on time is so difficult, but according to announcements made by cabin staff it is often due to passengers arriving late at the gate.",Promoter
"Flew London Heathrow to Dubai. Outstanding. Comments apply both ways. First time on an A380 and also first in Emirates business class. Normally fly with BA but for various reasons decided to give Emirates a go and very glad I did. Speedy check-in and straight into a very quiet and large lounge at LHR T3 with excellent food and beverage. Boarding straight from lounge onto top deck of A380. Had 3 aisle seats for the family, noticeable that Emirates have narrowed the aisle to allow for the wider seating arrangements. Very nice to have a near private seat and no neighbour, nice touch having the soft drink mini bar at each seat, and lots of good accessible storage. Seat took a little getting used to, I prefer being able to put my feet on the floor rather than on a foot rest and when lying flat out the shape of the seat in front encroaches where your legs go so means for taller people you have to adjust your position in the seat to be comfortable. The food was excellent, best I have had on board in 20 plus years and the crew were friendly and worked hard (I had slight concerns before flying as reputation is Emirates can be a bit hit and miss). Nice touch was the barman taking souvenir photos on request for passengers at the bar in an old style 60s technology Polaroid type camera - quite exciting for my daughter seeing a picture appear. And yes, being able to walk down to the bar makes for a good experience. Entertainment system and screen excellent. Phone can be used, wifi slow but ok for basic browsing. Large accessible toilets that were kept spotless for the entire flight. Fast tracked though immigration and priority luggage turned up first and escorted straight to the waiting limo. Overall this trip was on a different level to any I have had for many years, I will certainly now use Emirates as carrier of choice where possible if this is the normal standard.",Promoter
"Barcelona to Sydney via Dubai with Emirates. The A380 in economy is roomy enough but service was again found wanting after meal service. Dubai won't allow liquids of more than 100ml past the boarding gate area so you rely on being provided enough water inflight. This I found near impossible and with my annoying dry cough I needed the liquid. I tried repeatedly to hail a passing staff member only to be ignored. Never before have I pressed the assistance button but when a staff member finally responded it was with an impatient look but she eventually brought a mouthful of water in a plastic cup. Hardly enough to keep well hydrated. When disembarking I spotted a water fountain with cups down the front end of economy I could have used, had I been able to get past the two large men sound asleep beside me - the perils of the window seat. I will try another airline for my next trip.",Detractor
"Manchester to Dubai with Emirates. It was disappointing - paid to upgrade to business class and maybe expected too much. After queuing for check in we were immediately welcomed by the staff saying ""You are on a saver business ticket so you can't use the lounge"". Yes we knew that, but thankyou for making us feel so welcome. Onboard we settled into row 18 in the lovely A380 seats. The cabin supervisor was coming through welcoming people onboard - she clearly missed us out and carried on. No smile or hello. We hadn't paid enough, obviously. Next my husbands seat did not recline or indeed move. The centre partition was jammed half way down. The cabin supervisor came over and shrugged. We will reset the seat and see what happens - it got stuck half way to lie flat. We changed seats off our own back but the only seats available together were in row 26 infront of the rowdy men's pub area (inflight bar). If you want a peaceful flight don't sit in the rear section. It's like lying down at a party. The food service started - they took our orders early on but oh dear, our choices weren't available. No apology even though they would have known that already at time of taking the order. The food we got was lovely but really - back row problem in any class obviously. After being at the party a while, listening to some loud stories and eating something we didn't really want we found yet 2 more individual seats further down the cabin to try and sleep. It was shoddy the whole trip. Downstairs it was half full and people no doubt had 3 seats each anyway. We upgraded not for the food but to lie down and be more comfortable. I guess we got that bit eventually but at a price we personally wouldn't pay for in the future.",Passive
"  Flew Emirates from Melbourne to Singapore. Check-in and boarding was a breeze as boarding was done according to zones (seat numbers) which prevented crowding at the boarding gate.

Increased checked baggage allowance, now 2 x 23 kg, was great. Check in online very easy with free seat selection. NB: if you require a visa for the country you are traveling too, you can still check in on line but will not be able to print your boarding pass as the check in counter must first verify your visa.",Promoter

"  Flew Emirates from Perth to Munich via Dubai. Soon after boarding we had to fill out a menu card to select our meal. Despite being told we could choose when we eat the meal, service was at a fixed time. A few hours later when it was time to serve the meal I was told they had run out. They could have worked that out hours before as I was unable to eat the other selections. They said they would write it up to ensure it didn't happen again on the next flight but the next flight knew nothing about it. So the eat anytime wasn't true, nor was their resolution. The travel instructions for the business class driver showed the wrong address on his chit in Dubai. It was not the address we provided. Obviously we got lost. The lounges were very ordinary.

There is also free 10MB wifi which was good enough for me to send a text. Generally, I enjoyed my first time flying with Emirates. Not to forget, the cost of the tickets was reasonable. Kuala Lumpur - Dubai - Casablanca and return for approximately 500 Euros, which is not bad at all.",Passive
  Bangkok - Hong Kong. Greeted with indignance at Bangkok Lounge which was my very first impression of Emirates having flown Singapore and Qatar many times. Comfortable lounge. On board brand new A380-800 was comfortable with all the latest gadgets. Food ok and wine list a credit to the selectors except for Champagne. Why would you choose such a large House as Moet which seems totally out of balance with the rest of the wine selections? Friendly service although not as professional as Singapore and Qatar. HKG-BKK on an older A380 was a real experience. Seats feel more cramped than the new version although I have read they are the same width. Nowhere to put your arms when reclining and it feels like a very cramped space. Food was downright awful and service was staff who in their attempt to be over friendly and hip just got it wrong. I would much pefer to pay the extra money for Singapore and Qatar where I am almost guaranteed of a better experience. Upon disembarkation the staff were very rude. They forgot to give me my arrival papers on board.,Detractor
"Expecting a great deal based on other reviews we decided to pay more to fly with Emirates from Dubai to London Heathrow. Unhelpful Emirates Staff at Heathrow - could barely muster a smile. Completely oversold their family friendly service. It was a guessing game as to what we had to do with the stroller for our 7 month old. Although the kids meals were given as they had been pre-ordered I don't think they were particularly great quality. In terms of the cabin crew - rude, unfriendly and I could go on. We were issued the wrong menu - no apology. I asked for a glass of water for my little girl and it was as if I'd asked for gold. The serving of the food and drinks was very disjointed - no system, no organisation. I wasn't offered food twice as they bypassed me. My partner was missed out on a few occasions too. No apology. They didn't bother with the kids, I went to change the baby and when I was returning to my seat I had to wait in the aisle for 5 mins for them to move out of the way. They are clearly more important than you. The toilets were not maintained. I have always flown with Virgin in the past and will continue to do so in the future.",Detractor
"EK208 from New York JFK to Dubai on May 18. Check-in lines were slow and the agent that checked us in acted like he wanted to be anywhere but there. Boarding was late and done by Zone numbers on boarding passes. The agents were strict about it and I like that - board when it's your zone and not just push and shove. Friendly flight attendants throughout the flight except one attendant who was stoic and robotic. All the others were smiles and happy to get water or snacks. Smooth take off and delicious meal (and plenty of it) was served within 90 minutes of take off. Tons of movie/TV options on ICE - but wifi wasn't working. No big deal but Emirates touts it so much it was a bit of a bummer. Screaming kids throughout the flight - not EK fault but they put the families with children in the first 2 sections of economy so if you want quiet sit in the last 2 sections. Pizza snack provided mid-flight, and in the galley fresh fruit, drinks and snacks available throughout flight. Landing in Dubai around 1pm they provided a breakfast which was good but better if it had been a lunch due to the time. One thing - the seat is ok at first but after 10 hours your bottom will be sore. Bring your own pillow or cushion and save yourself some pain. Smooth landing and short taxi to Terminal 3, but sat on the plane an extra 20 minutes as gate agents had some issue with electrical connection to the plane for the APU. Off the plane and quickly through immigration, but bags took a bit of time coming. Overall a good flight and for the price ($800 round-trip) worth the value.",Promoter
"Barcelona to Dubai with Emirates. Barcelona is one of the most passenger friendly airports we have ever flown through. From arrival to departure everthing to negotiate is very easy and it is for sure one of most favourite airports. However, the business class lounge is really in the dark ages. The food offering is really just appalling. Yesterday, there were 3 bowls of crisps, tortillas chips and bread bits. Sandwiches which had no butter, and just a piece of meat shoved in between. On another tray with a sign that says no pork, there is another tray of small rolls with cheese and stuff etc. It was lunch time when we went in and I was hungry having had a 4 hour journey to get to the airport. A tray of danish pasties appeared from the kitchen, at lunch time. On another counter there were plastic bowls of pasta salad. Just pasta with a dollop of cesar dressing. Getting on wifi is a huge mission. This is not in anyway shape or form Emirates standard of lounge and really needs to be addressed. Business and First class fares are not cheap and we have come to expect better than what is offered in Barcelona Airport.",Promoter
"Good trip with Emirates from Bangkok to Hong Kong on A380 which is a great plane. Great entertainment system. The meal service appeared disjointed but this is because they have 2 sections of service on the upper deck which is not consistent and gets confused - often you hear ""my colleague will be back with this or that"" but it never appears. The staff are individually very good though and the bar service onboard is great.",Passive
"The trip from Gatwick to Bangkok via Dubai with Emirates was uneventful which is good. The A380 is a great plane but somehow this is proving to be an issue with the service. I think the Premium cabins are too big for the staff to handle. They have devised some scheme of serving meals but are very confused about it. It ends up with the second line of means not being served consistently like the first. That is wine not served till food is done, etc. This actually needs managing and maybe a different approach. Otherwise, entertainment system is good, fascinating and will provide hours of pleasure. I noted that meal service has been cut on the sectors. The service staff are individually good but really the team work needs managing.",Passive
"  Flew from Dubai to Shanghai. I have been traveling with Emirates since 2002 and a Skywards gold card holder since 2006. Over the last 3-4 years their inflight service can be best described as indifferent, this is especially true of the younger set of flight stewards. At Dubai airport the Emirates ground staff service is abysmal, it has been that way for a long time, even the food in the business lounge can be best described as average. The inflight service has been going downhill. Service it seems mainly depends mainly on individual personalities rather than as mantra. I used to complain before but no longer.

Service was good, though some of the cabin crew appeared tired and not happy when requests were made. The A380 is a great aircraft and the journeys made did other make me tired. Food was OK, though concerned that the quality has somewhat changed as opposed to previous flights with the airline. Some meals were nice, though could have been better in some aspects. The WiFi service is ad-hoc and did not always work properly. This could be explained by virtue of the fact that there are Internet restrictions when flying over certain countries. No complaints otherwise.",Promoter
"  Dubai to Lisbon with Emirates. The B777-300 looked a bit tired compared to the B777-300ER, seat pitch seemed tighter, the entertainment screen was cracked and did not fully respond, the headsets were awful - seeming to increase engine noise and necessitating deafening volume to hear anything on screen. The seat cushion was a bit lacking in padding. Wine arrived early but from about climb out and for nearly 3 hours we experienced severe turbulence and in spite of regular calls for seat belts to be fastened and even the crew having to return to their seats for lengthy periods the service was somehow maintained. Dinner this time was king prawns with rice and greens in sweet chile sauce and better than we have often had in business class. The approach to Lisbon was equally bumpy but finishing with an excellent smooth landing about 20 minutes late. When I complimented the purser on the staff performance she invited me to their area at the rear to repeat my comments ""because I want them all to hear your compliments"" and gave me a couple of Drambuies to take home as a souvenir. There can be no better way to fly economy than this although try to get the B777-300ER and possibly bring your own noise cancelling headset.",Promoter
"  Flew Emirates from Lisbon to Dubai. Full flight on fairly new aircraft with adequate pitch although a bit narrow. Take off and landing on time although parked away from the terminal at Dubai. The cabin crew were excellent - smart and friendly as always - to the extent that, knowing the habit of serving drinks after the food, I asked for a wine when getting seated and it was brought even before we were at cruising height. The seafood meal of chargrilled salmon was delicious and accompanied by yet another wine. After dinner coffee was accompanied by a wide range of liqueurs. Cabin staff were regularly coming through the cabin to offer drinks and to check after passenger comfort and finished with ice-cream about an hour before landing. The other thing to mention is the 'assisted passenger service' which was superb at both ends with a helper staying with you from check-in to the aircraft door and again from aircraft door to pick-up transport and then actually refusing a tip.",Promoter
"  I was flying Emirates from Muscat to New York via Dubai, with a friend who has an Arabic last name. During boarding we were called aside at the boarding counter as his name had to undergo an additional security clearance. We were the first ones to commence the boarding procedure, but after 2 hours of waiting they still had not resolved the issue. They told us the visa was OK, and that it was some kind of issue in the Emirates systems. We were not told exactly what the issue was, all we could see was that the boarding desk in Dubai was arguing with the Emirates office in JFK for the boarding release. The debate affected three travelling parties. Despite the flight already being 45 minutes delayed the JFK office refused to support the Dubai ground staff in clearing the passengers, but instead opted to open a roughly half-hour general debate with the Dubai desk on how to use the system and on the trainings they needed. This debate was held on loud-speaker. Long story, short: In the end I was told to board the plane alone or lose my flight while my friend was offloaded to take a following flight. (Curiously enough 5 minutes after Emirates closed the flight my friend was cleared, but by then it was too late to get aboard). I ended up waiting for him half a day at JFK. I found the whole incident to be quite unprofessional, and I believe the airline ground staff (especially in JFK) should collaborate more in the interest of the customer rather than power playing games with each other. This is the third incident I had with Emirates (I was once told to choose another carrier if I didn't like flying with Emirates after they kept delaying my flights for 2 working days).",Detractor

  Birmingham to Adelaide via Dubai with Emirates. The Birmingham to Dubai leg was in an A380 and OK but seat was narrow for business class. We switched to a Boeing 777-300 in Dubai. Can't help thinking anyone in economy who was able to lie across 3 seats would have had a better trip. The Boeing 777 seats are at a 15 degree angle so your legs can not be flat. This flight seemed understaffed. Too few bathrooms which were tiny and not always clean. The focus seemed to be on serving those who wanted alcohol throughout the flight rather than basic quality care to everyone. Definitely not value for money - at best I would describe it as poor premium class.,Detractor
"What happened to Emirates? This airline misconnected our baggage on the way back from Bangkok and as a result our one night and day in Istanbul were totally ruined. To make matters worse they have the most disgraceful staff representing them at IST airport. A third party agency whose staff ask ""what our problem is?"" After waiting 2 hours and only being given 50 dollars to cloth ourselves, no explanation where our baggage is or when it will arrive. On top of this complete disaster the inflight service was terrible, with inexperienced crew having absolutely no idea how to do their job. Will never fly Emirates again.",Detractor
"  Easy internet booking, seat selection, and food choice if required. Check in on-line up to 48 hrs before departure, allows for a quicker baggage check in. Chauffeur driven Mercedes to Emirates entrance at Gatwick. Fast track through security is not that fast. Boarding gate is a walk away from the lounge. Priority boarding to top deck of the A380. Greetings at the door. I like seat 16K, mini bar is aisle side giving you well defined privacy, plenty of storage in the stowage below the two windows. The dÃ©cor, some say bling, suits me. 15 inch screen, with separate tablet, so watch a movie and monitor the flight at the same time. Business class seats have aisle access. Served pre departure drink, with a drinks menu if required. Amenity kits are handed out on night flights, Bvlgary fragrances. On this leg, I elected to forego onboard meal and sleep, and the crew woke me for a meal. 4 hrs sleep and headed to the rear bar area which was buzzing. Food is plentiful in finger picking style. Hennessey XO brandy and other branded spirits. The crew make flying fun. After arriving into Dubai, the lounge is the same, good food and drinks, lift to the boarding gate.

"Manchester to Bangkok via Dubai with Emirates. The first leg of our journey was great, we had the friendliest stewardess I have encountered she was just lovely and we travel regularly with a number of different long haul airlines. She took time to chat to the passengers - even though the flight was full, kept us topped up with drinks, snacks and meals and even took our photograph, it made the flight fun and go quickly. The plane was clean and although not one of the newest, comfortable and everything worked. On the second leg we were on a new A380, again the staff were friendly and responsive but we slept most of the way. The seats were comfortable and the plane was clean and the food tasty and plentiful. We did the same journey but obviously the other way around on our return to the UK, all fine although a bumpy flight but the staff were not as friendly and it did jade the experience. It just shows that the mood and service you get from the staff on board does make a big difference to the clients overall experience.",Promoter
"  Never ever fly Emirates if it is outside the Gulf region (they are good only for short distance local sectors in the gulf), especially to Asian cities like Hong Kong, Bangkok or Singapore. My trip to Bangkok and Hong Kong last week was a trauma, or a nightmare I can't get over, with them misplacing my luggage - on both flights - back to back and then in Bangkok it wasn't delivered until I had to leave the country, when I got it from their departure counter just in time to leave the country. In Hong Kong, they misplaced it (""erroneously"" according to the response of the customer service staff) only to have it delivered the next day to my hotel. Also, their customer service staff is irrational and do not respond in time to queries unless few email reminders are sent to them. I'd never recommend Hong Kong at all, since Emirates does not have a counter there to attend to baggage misplaced by them, it is outsourced to an agency (Jardine services) who don't speak English properly.

"  Brisbane to Stockholm via Dubai. I have been flying with Emirates for the last 15 years. I did stop for a couple of years when they went really bad in almost every aspect, but lately they have picked up on service and everything. On my recent flight though there were many things not right again. The service with Emirates is hit and miss. You can get lucky with extremely polite and efficient staff or very unlucky with poor staff. On this trip I experienced both. When a flight attendant replies to guest complaint about the ice cold, ie. not heated food with the answer she could not know I wanted it hot, then there is something severely wrong. Within Asia you will have good staff, within Europe you won't. The new A380 is a pleasure to fly, it is more spacious and new. The second leg of my journey was on an older model, a Boeing 777-300 and that was awful. It is impossible to move, eat, sit or do anything. My worst concern was the disgusting food. Also my folding table was dirty, so they might want to look into cleanliness. The entertaining system is marvelous, but in the older planes many gadgets do not work properly.",Passive

The seats for economy are very comfortable and for me plenty of room (I'm about 5'8). The flight attendants are friendly throughout the flight. The thing I look forward the most are the meals which are delicious. I'd recommend joining their rewards program if you use Emirates regularly as you start getting enough points to reach Silver/Gold membership. For me the benefits were, checking in can be done in a separate line or the business class counter, then when boarding members are called to board before everyone else and in Dubai you have access to the business class lounge, makes the economy flight much nicer.",Promoter
"  Horrible airline that leaves customers stranded and out of pocket. My original flight was to depart 4th April from Tokyo Haneda to Brussels via Dubai. I had a connecting Eurostar booked from Brussels to London, which is my final destination. Due to the unfortunate events at Brussels, my flight from Dubai to Brussels was cancelled. However, I was informed (with a lousy text) less than 24hrs before the first leg to Dubai. I then had to contact customer service and spent hours trying to get my flight rerouted. 1st, they wouldn't take me to my final destination which was London, nor did they offer me a reroute to bring me back to Brussels to catch my Eurostar to London. They said my ticket could not be refunded due to ticket class (when they cancelled the flight) so I could not book another flight to get myself home to London. They said the only way I could go to London with Emirates was to top up EUR700, which is ridiculous. They told me to ring back every 2-3 hours to check if I got on a rerouted flight as all forwarding flights from Dubai were overbooked (I was in a completely different timezone, had to wake up every few hours, and less than 20 hours before my first leg was to depart) and they also emphasised that if I arrived in Dubai and was not confirmed on a connecting flight (I'll be in the air, so I wouldn't know till I landed), I will have to cover my own accomodation in Dubai till a connecting flight could be confirmed. Extremely frustrated with the situation, I told them to book me on the first confirmed flight that I could get all the way from Tokyo to Paris, which resulted in me being stranded in Tokyo for 2 additional days. I also had to pay for a new Eurostar ticket back to London as Emirates would not cover it. Adding a cherry to the cake, my luggage did not arrive with me in Paris (which I did attempt to check at Dubai that the luggage did make it to the connecting plane, and I was assured it did). After much arguing, Emirates baggage staff assured me that they will send the luggage to my forwarding address directly in London. Fast forward to 13th April, rang Emirates in the past few days only to find that they didn't know where my luggage was other than it was put on a flight to Heathrow on 8th April. Yesterday, the French office told me to call Heathrow myself to look for it. After arguing with them, they then contacted their UK team and located my bag at the airport. Emirates French office customer service then told me to go to Heathrow T5 Belt XX to collect my delayed luggage. I was infuriated and instead of offering to arrange delivery to me as they had promised on the 6th April, she offered me an email address to contact to try and 'convince them to send it to me'. I don't believe they have adhered to their conditions of carriage in both instances with my cancelled flight and delayed baggage but the airline has not offered me any compensation nor apology and I am still waiting on getting my delayed luggage back from the most incompetent airline.",Detractor

I was told I needed to check in my carry on along with my 2 checked bags. My 2 check-in bags were only 10kg each. He scared me saying, I will be charged $150 fee for my carry on bag since I have a laptop bag also. He reiterated only 1 piece of baggage can be carried on board on a A380. Very poor form and service. I didn't expect this from Emirates. I declined his offer and proceeded with my carry on and laptop bag. Nobody stopped me at the gate. Hundreds of other passengers had bigger and heavier bags. Perhaps he took me for a first time traveler but I know the rules and facts. Awful customer service.",Detractor
"  After traveling on long distances routes with various carriers over the last 5 years I decided to go back and revisit Emirates in the A380 transiting in Dubai. I'm happy I did. Flew Hong Kong to Madrid via Dubai. Emirates seem much improved to me. The upper deck in the A380 is peerless, but there are a number of things that set Emirates apart now, in my opinion. The ground staff and transit interactions in Dubai, at least in Business, are just head and shoulders above anything else. The Business Departures is actually separate and you enter the plane directly from the lounge: stress-free, anyone? No lines, no hassle, no hysteria. The synergy is seamless. I love Cathay and Hong Kong, but they don't have that. JFK or Heathrow? Dream on. I recently had an appalling transit experience with Turkish in Istanbul and I would say this flight on Emirates showed how much more professional and logistically advanced Emirates are than that overrated carrier. Not to mention that the Dubai lounges are huge with great food and smiling staff. On board: again, top service, attentive and unfailingly good-humored. The walnut panelling is really nice, the cabins are soothing and elegant. The inflight screens are huge and crystal clear, wide selection of multi-lingual movies, including new releases from Korea and Japan. Food was superb, and I mean superb. For the first time in years I actually enjoyed the entire experience of a 14 hour flight. Moreover, they offer free limo service in every city you arrive in: they don't botch the reservations and the guys are waiting for you at the gate. What! Given that their prices are average, I would say Emirates now outclass almost every other long distance carrier if we except the Japanese, Korean Air, Singapore and Cathay, and maybe Quantas. But do any of these offer the add ons and extras that Emirates offer? I'll have to try a few of them in the near future. However, for the time being I am switching my allegiance to Emirates because they have cracked the nut on this one. Certainly, going East-West via Dubai there's no competitor.",Promoter
"  Munich to Cape Town return via Dubai with family of four. Positive: Check in at all airports (online and at counter) was smooth and fast, as enough counters were open. Ground staff was friendly and helpful (we had to print out online boarding passes in DXB as customs could not read from tablet screen). Boarding was fast too. All flights left in time and arrived in time. Food was good quality. Frequent beverage services during all the flights. Great entertainment system. Seats with good legroom. Negative: Seats on the airplane did not match those selected in the seating chart during booking. Seats should pitch a bit more. Meal services quick but not timed very good in our opinion",Promoter
"A real tale of two halves flying with Emirates. Boarding at Birmingham was fine. Seat pitch was ok for someone who is 6'6"". Food and entertainment both acceptable. However, the service on both this leg and the Dubai to Bangkok leg was sadly lacking. Pressing the call button usually resulted in a 10-15 minute wait. The same couldn't be said for the return legs 2 weeks late where the crew couldn't have been more attentive. Couple of points of note: The A380 is a wonderful aircraft. Spacious, bright, quiet and comfortable. If you are sat towards the front downstairs there is a slight lack of overhead locker space due to the way the aircraft tapers in. It is much quieter sitting at the front compared to elsewhere in the aircraft so do try and sit in the forward cabin. Boarding was hit and miss at both DXB and BKK. Some announcements were done via the tannoy and some by the ground crew shouting out instructions. From DXB to BKK, there was a drunken passenger who kept singing and waking passengers up. The crew kept coming to speak to him but then also kept bringing him drinks. The situation could have been handled better. Now that the A380 is flying into/out of BHX, will certainly look to book with Emirates again in the future",Promoter
"  I stepped onboard my Emirates flight from London Gatwick to Phuket via Dubai to that lovely aroma of business class. It's not a normal thing for me to travel in business class, but it isn't a distant dream anymore. The seats appealed to me, and I loved the layout. Once I had settled in, I spotted one flaw, which was the lack of storage everywhere, but the storage available just about accommodated all my items. Once we had taken off, I sat down to what I would have described as a 'bumpy flight' coming from a nervous flyer though. However, the wide selection of movies, space available for sleep and excellent dining occupied my thoughts to more important things. There are only a couple of words to describe this cabin - beautiful, elegant and stylish. The second flight had a more tranquil atmosphere in a smaller cabin with a different design, due to an older, smaller plane. The entertainment was a little disappointing, as the response for all the channels (which were very limited) was far from instant. The dining started and ended on a slightly different tone, it couldn't disappoint. Overall I strongly recommend Emirates.",Promoter
"  I chose Emirates for 3 reasons, ability to fly out of Boston, pricing, and desire to experience the A380 for the first time. I had flown EK once previously, a HKG-BKK one way several years ago. I was aware of their 4 star ranking and recalled from my previous trip that I felt that accurate. I am not sure that I would give them a solid 4 ranking based on these two flights. First, the good. Despite a miserable snowstorm in Boston we only had a brief delay in departure and made up time enroute. The flight only had 130 passengers so boarding was quick and easy. I would have thought that the high ratio of FAs to pax would have resulted in exemplary service. Not so. There was no drink service offered and an hour after takeoff, needing to take some medicine, I was finally able to flag down the Purser who promptly took care of me and checked back several times throughout the flight. Pity the rest of the crew were not so attentive. One appeared annoyed when I asked for another drink and pressing the call button was ignored. Though the bell sounded and the light went on, the FA told me it wasn't working when I walked back to the galley. The food at lunch suffered from the long delay in serving it. The chicken pesto sounded great but was too difficult to cut let alone chew. The bread (in cellophane) was cold. The flight itself was very smooth. Changing to the A380 in Dubai was trying due to the extreme heat and the mass of people. Once aboard I found that the seat I had selected from a seating chart was not where I expected it to be. Aisle seat next to the middle galley. I was banged into by FAs the entire flight, rarely with an apology. The service trolleys were continually blocking every aisle in every direction making a trip to the pitifully scare restrooms an ordeal. The food was better than the trip out. So good, in fact, that the FAs were continually eating. I have never seen so many FAs consuming food in plain view of pax. Again, smooth flights but service wise I would be hard pressed to give this a sold 4 star rating. No comparison to the level of service on Qatar, which thankfully had just begun service out of Boston. Am hoping the flight back home in two weeks are better.",Passive
"  Adelaide to Delhi via Dubai with Emirates. I had selected my seats for travel on 26th December 2015 but the seats were released and I could not check in on my mobile. I tried many times to check in and choose my seat but the system locked me out. When I made a phone call to Emirates they told me of their inability to do a thing about it. This resulted in being allocated a horrible seat in the middle, for the 13 hours long flight with the aisle person making it almost impossible for me to even go to the toilet. Topping it up the Emirates staff was unresponsive on the plane. When the staff was called they did not come even after pressing the tab 5 times. The entertainment system had so many glitches that I could hardly watch it. The worse thing was the bus from the plane to the terminal herding us like cattle. The experience was not to end there since when I got my luggage back from the conveyor belt the lock was broken. When I sent the complaint to Emirates they said sorry for the things but passing on the blame to the respective authorities.",Detractor
"  We expected to arrive in Dubai by 0015 and board our onward flight to Kuwait by 0145. Our flight was expected to leave at 1415 from London Heathrow on 31st march, but departed at 1520. We expressed concerns to the staff in London and were assured that we would not miss our connecting flight. Onboard the flight the crew said they could not be certain if we will make the flight as it depends which Gate etc the flight would be on. This left us confused and apprehensive for the rest of our flight. As we arrived in Dubai at 0100, we were met by a Emirate representative who said we had already been offloaded the flight and had us booked on the next flight at 0745 the next morning. They gave us a meal voucher and said that is the best they could do. The staff said because of immigration rules they cannot offer anything to passengers if it is less than 8 hours. There was no empathy and I do not blame the staff from connections to the lounges we spoke to, as they kept referring there are no managers on duty who are empowered to authorize a place to rest and this is standard policy for missed flights arising due to delays. We chose this flight due to the short connection. If we wanted a longer layover, we would have booked it, but timing was important to us. We truly experienced a journey in a class of its own.",Detractor
"Emirates from Melbourne to Colombo via Singapore. First flight operated by A380-800 second on a Boeing 777-300ER. Both flights full in J class. Check in at MEL fast. The new lounge at MEL impressive and elegant. Food and service of high quality. Flight from MEL departed on time. Crew good. IFE top notch, however sad to see how far south food on board Emirates have gone. Unimaginative and bland. Far worse than what other airlines serve in Economy class. Arrival into Singapore was on time. Singapore to Colombo the crew were good and IFE excellent. Food most passengers left untouched. Arrived on time into Colombo, priority bags took more than 30 minutes to come out and this is not acceptable. All in all Emirates has a good product but cracks from over expansion have started to appear.",Passive
"Manchester to Johannesburg via Dubai. I am a big fan of the Emirates A380, quiet, comfortable and plenty of personal storage space. On the last flight out of Manchester that day I had dinner in the lounge prior to boarding and watched a movie on the 21"" screen during standing, taxi and take off before getting my bed made as soon as the seatbelt sign went out. I got about 5 hours of sleep before landing. The second leg in the 777-300 is very different. I sat in the aisle seat and my partner had the window. Unlike the A380 window and middle seats of the 2-3-2 layout need to clamber over the aisle seat to get in and out. Seats are comfortable but not full flat bed when reclined. There is a slight angle although not enough to prevent my getting to sleep. Dinner choices were nicely presented and the curry had flavour and heat, as promised by the menu. Both legs on time and bags were on the carousel soon after arrival in Johannesburg.",Promoter
"  The large upstairs business class on the A380 is often relatively empty on the Bangkok to Hong Kong route route but on this short 2-day round trip both sectors were virtually full. Only the excellent bar at the back seemed to attract just a few passengers. The privacy in the window seats is superb, the large IFE screens make those of some airlines seem small in comparison, and a very extensive IFE programming. FAs go about their business calmly and flat bed seats are popular with some passengers who prefer to nap than partake of the meal service. With Emirates ticket prices for business class vastly cheaper than any other airline, this flight is quite literally a steal!",Promoter
"  Brisbane to London via Dubai, and Emirates is quite a good airline with generally helpful staff and acceptable food. On this particular flight we suffered delays.

I would still fly them again next year though.",Passive
"  London to Perth via Dubai was our first time flying with Emirates (we usually fly with BA) but sincerely hope this will not be our last. From our visit to the Emirates Lounge at Heathrow until our chauffeur dropped us off in Perth we enjoyed every minute. The cabin crew were hard working, attentive and cheerful. Food and wine was excellent and the A380 is a very comfortable plane to travel on. I have seen reports that the crew can be inattentive but I can honestly state that wasn't the case in our experience. It pains me to say, having been so loyal to BA for many years, in future our airline of choice will now be Emirates",Promoter
"  Sydney to Auckland, and Emirates offers excellent customer service on the ground and in the air. The inbound flight was late arriving resulting in a delayed departure. Emirates handled this exceptionally well, regular updates both in the lounge and at the gate. The service on board was professional at all times and made the trip very comfortable. The free inflight wifi is a great benefit and allowed me to keep in contact with my business colleagues to advise of my impending late.

"  London Heathrow to Dhaka via Dubai, returning to Newcastle via Dubai. London Heathrow to Dubai started off well as I only had hand luggage so getting to gate was a breeze thanks to Emirates easy and intuitive mobile check-in. It all went downhill from here though. On boarding was clear my ICE seat back screen was not working or responding. Worse it wouldn't switch off and kept flickering. I informed a member of the cabin crew about the issue but there wasn't a lot of enthusiasm or effort made to help. I asked if could be switched off if it could not be made to work, and never heard anything for the rest of the flight leaving me with flickering screen to contend with for 8 hours which was distracting and didn't really help me sleep on a night flight. I understand things go wrong and am reasonable but its how you handle things that matters. Once over Dubai, landing was delayed and we were put in holding pattern for 1.5 hours due to fog. We were informed that ground staff would be on hand to help those with missed connections and those that had tight ones to make and I was relieved at first to see a lot of staff about. However it seemed they were only helping certain people and when I asked, I got yelled at very disrespecftfully to go look at the departure board. I was left to fend for myself when I only had 20 minutes to get my gate for the flight to Dhaka which was showing as ""Final Call"". Infuriated and out of breath I arrived at the gate just in time to be met with a surly and unapologetic gate staff. I was then shoved on bus in the Dubai heat and we were left there for half an hour without any updates past take-off time. We were then bussed to the cargo terminal where our plane was parked and boarded and then left for a further 45 minutes without much information. The saving grace of the DXB-DAC sector was the crew were quite friendly and warm, and unusually the catering was rather nice. Returning DAC-DXB, even getting into the aiport was a nightmare due the corruption and difficulties that have returned with using Dhaka airport and the use of the local airlines Biman handling team is slow and innefficient. The hassling for money of my elderly mother from her requested assistance was also unwelcome. The flight itself DAC-DXB was uneventful, but the food was atrocious even by Emirates standards - almost inedible. Thas was repeated on the DXB-NCL sector as well. All in all very much going downhill, even the hard product is showing some weariness and there's complacency in improvements on these - the 10 abreast seating on Boeing 777's is horrific. Staff attitude has always been their weak point but it has got particularly bad to the point of contempt, especially when things go wrong. All in all there doesn't seem to be any benefit of flyng Emirates anymore - other carriers do this better now.",Detractor
"  Tried Emirates for the first time from London to Melbourne via Dubai, UK having previously travelled Singapore Airlines. The difference could not be more stark. My experience on the outbound flights was not good and unless something pretty good happens on the way back, I wouldn't recommend them or use them again. The positive was the entertainment system which was good quality and a good selection and check in was efficient and pleasant. Seats were uncomfortable (hard) and the seat on the second leg was broken so it wouldn't lock in recline mode (flight full, so no spares). The quality of the food was not good and out of the three meals over the journey, two of them had ran out of one of the two choices supposedly available, so locked into a dish I did not want. Whilst the crew were pleasant enough the service was really bare bones and seem to focus around the main meal times rather than between times. The second leg of the flight was extremely cold in the cabin and despite people raising it, it didn't improve. Blankets all round. Broadband was woeful despite paying for it and I gave up in the end. I may have been spoilt by Singapore Airlines and it may have been a one off bad experience, but serious improvement necessary.",Detractor
  Casablanca to Colombo via Dubai and Male with Emirates. From Casablanca was a fantastic crew who were responsive and attentive. The flight to Colombo via Male a very different set of crew who were totally opposite.The guy serving my side of the isle never spoke to pax in a full sentence - Coffee-sugar- milk- tray up/down etc. Hardly any smiles from many crew in the economy cabin. The meal service starts very late and it takes ages for them to clear the trays. The announcements were bad and confused. Its amazing how a crew can make the difference on a flight. The stopover hotel transfer worked well and food on all flights nicely presented. ICE entertainment was fabulous. Ground staff in Casablanca was friendly and efficient.,Passive

"  I was lucky enough to fly Emirates from Istanbul to Dubai in December 2015. The cabin crew was very nice and friendly, the seat back screens were the biggest I have seen in economy class, and the economy toilets were quite large. I had plenty of room to move around the toilets, and they had air freshener in there. The seats were comfy with lots of leg room, and the blanket they provided was quite long. When it was dark outside, they had little ""starry"" lights on the roof of the cabin to mimick the night sky.",Promoter
"Sydney to Christchurch. Arrived about 07:45 for 10:15 scheduled departure. Upon arrival at the airport it was obvious something was up, check-in row was E, queue snaked all the way to C. It took about 40 minutes for someone from Emirates to show up, in flight attendant gear, that knew what was going on (destination immigration system down, requiring manual checking of passports, etc). Some supervisors walked around looking harried, and useless. Anyway, having done online check-in again saved some time. Overall check-in would have taken more than an hour. At check-in desk I was made to take my cameras out of carry on and put camera bag in hold (12 kgs, my partner had less so we would have been within the allowance of twice 7 kgs but got ""it is for your safety"" lines, full flight etc), never had to do that. Anyway my lenses survived the trip. What was worse is that rules seemed totally inconsistent in terms of application. Hold luggage we had no more than 2/3 of our 32 kgs each allowance. Onboard service in line with Emirates reputation, in terms of quality of seating (Boeing 777-300 with ten across) food, friendly attendants, 13 languages across them). Upon arrival in NZ very surprised with both passport control and customs/ quarantine being so friendly compared to Sydney Airport.",Passive
"My Emirates route was Hamburg to Bangkok via Dubai, connecting to Yangon with Bangkok Airways. Hamburg to Dubai was delayed so I needed to rush to the other Gate which was unfortunately in another Terminal. From the stopover time of about 1.5 hrs I had left before boarding 20 mins. The rest of the time was the Bus from a parking position to the Gate, which took 25 mins. The flight from DBX to BKK was delayed as well, so again from around 1.5 hrs stop over was only 40 mins left until departure. There again I needed to run from the arrival gate to the departure gate, passing security once again, I made to be at the depature gate about 5 min before depature, luckily Bangkok Airways was waiting so I could take the flight. Arriving in Yangon, my luggage was lost in Bangkok due to the short stopover time. To get the paperwork done at the airport was a kind of journey, but it arrived in my hotel in the evening. The service on board is okay, nothing special. Mostly the staff was friendly and if you ask for drinks they will bring it to you. However it takes forever until they clean up the trays from the seat, which was not acceptable. Normally the stopover times were more then sufficient, however all of them ended up to be in a rush or to run through the airport to catch the next flight. Dubai Airport looks nice, but is very badly organized, and this for a new Airport! I know Emirates can be cheap, but I prefer to have a smooth journey and not to be in hurry all the time.",Detractor

My only complaint, like on several of my recent flights with Emirates, is that the onboard wifi works terribly. It was painstakingly slow and a complete waste of even my $1!",Promoter
"We flew Emirates on Feb 14 on A380 from Dulles, Washington, DC to Dubai then on a B777 to Delhi. A380 is very quiet and a much smoother ride since it flies at a higher altitude. All flights were on time but the quality of service is not the same, they used to have a drink service before dinner or lunch which does not happen anymore. Now they bring the lunch and dinner followed by drinks. Washington to Dubai leg, service was much better than Dubai to Delhi leg. Still a pretty good airline and good service. We left Delhi on Feb 27 to spend 4 days in Dubai, back to USA on 2 March, 2016, we experienced a similar service.",Passive

No contact made by Emirates on this change early enough to seek better seating. When loading with economy passengers my wife was continually bashed with their large walk-on luggage, she had to move to one side to avoid in being hit. When inflight a very cold draft was continually experienced even with our personal valves shut off. Entertainment very good, but video quality on older aircraft poor.

"I have been a long time fan of Emirates from the 90's, when they provided enough competition to make flying more humane from the antipodes. More recently though I have been less than satisfied with their service levels and customer service, this has accelerated since the ""merger"" of routes with Qantas. This flight was not so pleasant - the flight was delayed from Gatwick due to an oil spill and impacted the whole journey. The inflight service was generally good, food okay, the A380 seats are in the top quartile at the price point for comfort and pitch, I was comfortable on the A380 for the whole journey despite being a tall Aussie. I even snagged some good seats near the bulkhead which made legroom no problem. The 777 segment from Dubai to Melbourne (via Malaysia) was not pleasant. The planes are older, tired, have narrower seats and I was uncomfortable the whole journey. Try and avoid any Emirates segments that use this older equipment, it generally sours your experience of Emirates. The main problems I had with this journey was the late departure. The 4 hour delay caused me to miss my booked connection, and I was put onto the dog-leg segment via Malaysia. Emirates have refused any form of compensation in breach of European rules and refused to supply any assistance at the journey end for this delay. The obnoxious behaviour of customer service staff makes me rethink my loyalty to this brand.",Passive

Total lack of customer care. I appreciate problems were caused by the storm in UAE, but this does not excuse Emirates of customer care. No information was supplied in Bangkok as to rescheduled flight and connections and therefore had 12 hour wait. Once on board flight the crew were indifferent and unhelpful. Arrived in Dubai and no help with connection flight. Went to business lounge and was told we had been downgraded to economy and we had 27 minutes to make the flight or would have to wait for 2 days for another flight. Was told luggage would be transferred on flight so we decided to run to catch the flight. Seated next to toilet and disturbed by smell and passengers all flight.

"I flew Business Class with Emirates from Brisbane to London with my daughter, her husband and three children - a three year old and twelve month old twins. I knew this was not going to be easy, but in my worst imaginings I hadn't dreamt it would be such a nightmare. The babies were booked on bassinet seats with their parents, but were too big to be able to use them. I was a few rows back with the 3 year old, but shared baby duties through the night. Right from before take-off, I could see we were not welcome. Even with the comfort of lie-down seats, it was very difficult to keep the little ones asleep. So we would take them to the bar area so they could crawl around a bit without disturbing too many people. On two occasions when I was there with our little twin with cerebral palsy, her fingers were stepped on by the same hostess who had made us feel so unwelcome. Towards the end of the long flight to Dubai, we were all exhausted, but not once was there any offer of relief or assistance from the attendants who were standing around chatting amongst themselves. Believe it or not, the next leg of the journey was worse, as the seats I was in with the three year old would not recline. On two occasions I sought help. The attendant said she would 'reset' the equipment. This meant the video system also went off for 15 minutes. I didn't see this attendant again. His seat did recline after this, but mine still did not! I tried again, different attendant but same story! I was forced to sit upright all the way. Having outlaid almost $10,000 for Business Class, I was not happy! Emirates boast about how many different countries the attendants come from. Perhaps they would do better to choose staff with a bit more empathy towards their passengers instead.",Detractor
"The Emirates A380 product is very good, although the seats in business class are rather tight, especially in fully flat position. Food was okay.

Then the passenger and his wife left the plane. But the wrong luggage was taken from the plane, and another bag not belonging to anyone was shown by a steward to us all. None of the staff apologised for the delay or inconvenience. I arrived at Malpensa two hours late and very tired, having started my trip the day before in Yogyakarta.

"Chose Emirates as part of our package holiday to the Maldives. It was a bit of a mixed bag: I did my back in badly the day before the long flights. Walking/sitting was a real struggle. When we arrived at Heathrow we got a wheelchair and asked about an upgrade. I was not looking for it to be free but hoped a concession could be made. There was no movement however we were given a front seat in economy so I could move around as freely as possible. My discomfort was not a negative against the economy seats as ordinarily there would have been no issue. The A380 flight out I couldn't really settle in to. The food was excellent and immediate service good. The lead attendant saw the pain I was in and said if there was anything he could do just ask. I appreciate their ability to do anything to help me was extremely limited however because of my discomfort I couldn't enjoy the in-flight entertainment but again, not their fault. Transfers etc in Dubai went well. They appeared a bit chaotic but it seemed to be controlled chaos. Because of my condition we were shepherded to a holding area where I could be taken to the right gate at the right time. The 777 flight to Male I slept through as took a strong sedative to knock me out, however I did wake for breakfast which was again very good. By the time we flew back my back was feeling a bit better so I could appreciate the in-flight entertainment more and it really is excellent. A huge choice of music, films, tv shows to eat away the hours whilst flying. The A380 we had from Dubai to Heathrow was newer than on the way out and the tv screen in economy was about the size of an ordinary laptop screen, which I thought was excellent. It was touch-screen and again the food was excellent. My only negatives (discounting my bad back which obviously wasn't Emirates fault) were that I enquired about an upgrade to business class from Dubai to Heathrow. Quoted $5000 for 2 people, which I thought was ridiculous however we wanted to finish off the holiday in style so offered $4000. Didn't move. Would they rather not sell the seats and make the extra cash anyway? She told me that Dubai had the highest upgrade charge of any airport in the word. The flight back from Dubai to London, whilst more comfortable with excellent food and in-flight entertainment, we really felt like we were economy. You get what you pay for I suppose but having your (and your girlfriends) flight-attendant call button on for 20+ mins with no response and no-one going past is unacceptable. I only wanted a drink. In the end I gave up and waited for food to be served but in typical British fashion, didn't say anything. They bragged about having in-flight Wifi. I personally didn't try to connect but my girlfriend did and had zero joy. So, overall very good. A few grumbles where perhaps they could have been more adaptable but recently flew BA to Barbados and Emirates pretty much topped them in every department.",Passive
"Since we were traveling with golfbags I phoned Emirates in Amsterdam requesting for a Van or MPV to pick us up for our transfer to the airport. A few hours before pick up time we received a call confirming our request and indeed we were picked up by a van. Smooth check in, we could hand-over our golfbags to the groundstaff who delivered them to the special luggage desk. Emirates uses the Aspire lounge in Amsterdam which is hard to find due all ongoing renovation work in this airport. Boarding went OK in group, F and C passengers boarding straight to the upper deck. Arrival in Dubai in the B-concourse and we had to disembark via the forward stairs, making all Y passengers wait. Transfer was smooth, we used the Emirates longe in the C-concourse which was very crowded at that time of the day. In Mauritius the luggage was delivered using 2 belts, one for F/C and one for Y. Our luggage was delivered quickly, the golfbags were hand delivered from a different belt, again a very good service. Being seated in the middle (E/F paired) seats, both of us were served by different flight attendants. We asked them in the beginning of both flights whether they could synchronize their service as much as possible, and this worked perfectly. Cabin crew were very nice and attentive. On both flights the food was plenty and of good quality.",Promoter

London Heathrow to Perth via Dubai with Emirates. As a nervous flyer the cabin crew were aware of it and they couldn't have been more attentive and considerate. This was based on the fact that the flight was quite empty so he said he had more time to spend with me. The food was amazing and the inflight entertainment is exceptional. On the way back it was a Qantas flight and their flight staff couldn't give a monkeys that I was terrified. As far as I'm concerned Emirates are outstanding compared to Qantas.,Promoter
"A quality product and service across the Tasman with Emirates from Sydney to Auckland. If you are an economy passenger on this route this is the only sensible alternative. 32-34 inches of space on a wide body jet compared to the cramped narrow bodied aircraft of QF or NZ. Service with a smile, economy meals that include extras QF did away with years ago to cut costs. Buy it with a QF flight number and you still get points, status credits and lounge access if a Club member.",Promoter
"Colombo to Melbourne via Singapore. I was allocated the wrong seat from check-in despite having booked it 2 months ago. I wouldn't have minded except that the new seat was near the toilets. When I inquired, it was found the seat I booked was still vacant. The ground staff at the boarding gate in Colombo were not very helpful except for one staff officer from Emirates. He was very professional and made the seat correction promptly.",Passive
"Flew with Emirates for the first time. JFK to Bangkok with layover in Dubai. I chose this flight due to short layover. All would be great if the flight was not delayed. We left JFK later than projected and ended up missing our flight from Dubai to Bangkok, resulting is a 8 hour layover. Emirates were not exactly sympathetic or apologetic and only after much fuss provided us with a few dollar worth food voucher (incorrectly printed for 3 passengers only rather than 4, which they were not happy to fix either). The flight was ok. A380 is an impressive plane. Seat are relatively comfortable in economy section, entertainment selection was very good. Food and drink service was ok. The crew was very international and not super friendly. Our seats were close to the galley and the staff not only left the curtain constantly opened, letting bright light in, they were also extremely loud, chit chatting, laughing. When I asked a flight attendant if she could close the curtain in order to reduce noise and make it darker so we could sleep she just walked away, returning in a few minutes with ear plugs, which I never requested. Eventually we ended up moving to the back of the plane (as flight was only half full) and had a peaceful reminder of the trip. Return flight from Bangkok to Dubai was also delayed. At some point there was airport security on board going through all carry-ons. However afterwards the flight took off and was uneventful, with same okay food/drink service and not overly friendly the international crew. Overall I was not very impressed with Emirates, their flight attendants could be more friendly and on ground crew could me more helpful.",Detractor
"Dubai to Paris with Emirates, and this time with my kids we have experienced an overbooking. At the checkin counter they told us we have no seats and have to go to another counter where they told us you have no seat, so we offer you an hotel 5 stars, dinner and breakfast (it was already midnight and the next flight scheduled at 7 am). I said I refused and they immediatly found 3 seats next each other. So problem solved quite quickly. The flight was good, the seat is comfortable. Food is good, staff is really nice.",Passive
"Flight no issues, inflight entertainment was not as expected or advertised. Food was not good at all. On my flight back to SA, the only good option I had was vegetable and was told that the other options were not available as it was finished. Most of the time cabin crew had to be asked twice as they had forgotten. Just some info for passengers, if you are asleep while serving food you will be left to sleep.",Passive
"Our flights to and from Cape Town using Emirates for the first time were in the main very good for economy class. The 777-300 ER is a fine aircraft, but as a lot of reviewers have mentioned with Emirates having a 3-4-3 seating arrangement it does make it quite cramped, and being in an aisle seat I was constantly bumped into with people moving up and down the aisle. The crews on all our flights were very good, happy and willing to serve and help the passengers. The food for economy class was very good indeed, and the individual menu was a nice touch, and there were plenty of water and juice runs throughout the flights. Compared to other airlines I've flown with, Emirates don't have a general bar service before they serve their meals, although they do offer wine, water or juice with your meal, but right behind the meal service comes the bar service which just felt odd. The ICE entertainment system was excellent, large screens, huge selection of films, TV, and music to while away your flight, and the external cameras showed you views you normally don't get to see unless you are a pilot. If Emirates changed to a 3-3-3 seating arrangement and increased the pitch too they would offer their economy passengers a fantastic service instead of a very good service.",Promoter
"So I finally flew with Emirates and apart from one thing it was a really nice experience. You can tell that their planes are young, seats are comfortable and ICE is really good, so many movies and you got nice headphones even in economy. Food on board was good, I liked the taste and was actually full. On my flight from Vienna to Dubai, it took almost 2 hours to serve the food and since it was a 6 hour night flight you want to sleep, however, on my second flight it was better. Price was really good, it was the second cheapest ticket I found. We had long layover in Dubai (on purpose because we wanted to see Dubai) where we were given a meal voucher for Dubai airport for a couple of restaurants which was really nice. I will definetelly fly with them again, already purchased tickets to Bali and plan other destinations this year as well.",Promoter

"Chauffeur pick up worked excellently, and is a really nice touch. The lounge at Birmingham was fairly small but large enough for the number of passengers and with good food and drink. The Birmingham to Dubai leg was on an old 777, and the 777 business product isn't as good as the product on other airlines for this length flight. The seats aren't fully flat nor do they have direct aisle access. As this was also an old plane the in flight entertainment was fairly poor. While the screen was enormous, the resolution was very low and the controls were frustratingly difficult. The cabin crew were fine without being outstandanding as was the food. The lounge at Dubai was very good as we were in a smaller one rather than the main central one. The food and drink offering was very good and I liked that some of the bar was self service. Dubai to Mumbai was on a newer 777 and the entertainment was much better. As this was a short flight through the night there is not too much to say, although the cabin crew were fairly good, they did insist on waking up passengers who had ordered food then clearly changed their mind and fallen asleep (it was 4am). Spending a long time trying to wake them up, not just a quick tap or hello. Arriving in Mumbai was fairly easy with prompt processing on the ground. The chauffeur pick up worked well although could have been better organised at the airport itself as you just had to look around the busy bundle of Emirates chauffeurs trying to find your name. A central person who located your driver would make it much smoother and more professional.",Passive
"Mumbai to Gatwick via Dubai with Emirates. Chauffeur pick up and check in/security at Mumbai went smoothly. The lounge is a shared one at Mumbai but nice and the staff excellent. Mumbai to Dubai was on an old 777 but was suitable for this length flight. The seat is comfortable and spacious, and the IFE screen of reasonable resolution and had a good selection. Food was fine. The lounge at Dubai is not a particularly good one in my opinion as it is huge and chaotic and not a particularly nice layout. I appreciate this is only business not first, but still would have preferred less of a corridor feel to it, as well as self service drinks areas dotted about. Dubai to Gatwick leg was excellent. The superior level of the seat is significant and avod is excellent. The cabin crew on this flight were friendly and attentive. The only very minor niggle is that the food and wine service were not coordinated at all, so the wine was served after the meal rather than with it. This was after two glasses of champagne and a gin and tonic though so no real complaint. The big let down was Gatwick airport where we were not offered premium service for immigration. Gatwick is awful at the moment and the queue was enormous. This as well as the ridiculous and terribly organised baggage reclaim (which clearly is not able cope with the A380) let down the whole premium experience of Emirates down.",Promoter
"Sydney to Dubai with Emirates. We were allocated the wrong seats from check-in. Ended sitting next to an inebriated passenger that made the trip the worst.

The only response I got was a computer generated letter.",Detractor
"Booked to fly from New Delhi to Accra via Dubai in business class with Emirates in Aug 2015 with a layover of 1 hr 20 mins in Dubai. The flight from Delhi took off 30 mins late and then circled Dubai before landing in a remote corner of the airport. We rushed and reached our boarding gate (20 mins before departure) just as the last of the economy passengers were boarding. We were denied boarding on the pretext that we were late at the gate - never mind that there was no one to receive us at the terminal, Emirates flight from Delhi was late and that last few passengers were still boarding right in front of us. Staff at the gate were rude, turned us away and asked us to get our re-routing from the Emirates customer service. With 2 kids who were sleepy and exhausted, we made our way to a long queue at the customer service counter. They routed us to Accra via Abuja and on my husbands persistent query assured us that Abuja had transit facilities. The situation in Abuja was far from this - no transit, we were made to collect our bags by paying for passenger trolleys, re-check in at Arik Air and fight customs / immigration who insisted on stamping our passports. The Arik Air flight was delayed, there was no business class lounge at the airport and the flight itself was a small propeller aircraft. We were happy to reach Accra in one piece after the harrowing experience. On registering a complaint with Emirates we were advised that they would investigate and needed 30 days - at the end of this period they came back with no admittance of guilt but offered us 15,000 frequent flyer points each which to date they have not credited to my children's account. Contrast this with our recent experience on Eithopian where we were transported from the tarmac when they were late on a flight from ACC to NBO and even connected our bags. Did not expect Emirates to treat business class passengers in this manner. They clearly are now such a big airline that they could not be bothered by these exceptions - imagine how they treat non-gold, economy class travelers - am glad to see other airlines now catching up with them.",Detractor
"Dallas to Dubai with Emirates - amazing airline. A380 with good service, tasty food. The seat comfort was good. The cabin crew are friendly, entertainment had some good games and the latest movies to watch. The personal video screen size was good. Every 4 hours they serve a meal or snack. You can also get get free drinks any time in the flight. Every 1 hour they come along with some juice and some refreshments. Ground service was nice, little busy but overall good.",Promoter

Crew were also good.",Promoter
We were very pleased in all respects with Emirates. The check in both in Gatwick and Dubai was swift and efficient. On board the seating was fine with plenty of leg room and the meals served were tasty. The best aspect is the in flight entertainment system which has a huge variety of films and TV and large screens to make viewing a pleasure and cameras on the plane so you can watch the take off and landing from the pilot's view. I even read my emails using on-board wifi. It's a million miles away from British Airways! I would not hesitate to fly with Emirates again.,Promoter
"Mumbai to Dubai and Emirates staff was very considerate. I was travelling with a active toddler. Dubai to San Francisco and the air hostess are least bothered. Not a sight of smile while welcoming. Young kids needs milk, is it not obvious or let parents carry them. Irony is they ran out of milk when asked for second time. In a 15 hour flight is it not reasonable for a parent to ask another serving of milk for toddler. I guess cabin crew staff needs to be trained to handle young kids and learn some patience instead of making faces. This is annoying for passengers.",Detractor
"From the moment I checked in, Emirates managed to make a mess of things. I asked the agent at the check in counter if I could use the lounge with my One World emerald status (Platinum with Qatar Airways), given that QF and EK code share the flight I was checking in for. She took my card then mistakenly entered the membership number with QF instead of QR. I didn't notice her error until I arrived at the QF lounge and was promptly denied entry. EK also switched my seat without informing me. When I asked about it at the gate, I was told that there was a note in the record that my seat had been changed in order to allow a family to sit together. That is fine, but EK could have at least had the courtesy to inform me at check in. Onboard, FAs did the minimum. I asked for a bandage for a small cut on my finger which the FA completely forgot about. The best was when I asked for ketchup to accompany my breakfast of hash browns and a frittata - exactly the sort of dishes one would eat with ketchup. I was informed that ketchup is only available in business and first class. What? Is ketchup the new Dom Perignon? Give me a break. Requests with the call button went ignored. Last time I flew with EK was in business class from NBO-KWI via DXB. I didn't find it to be a very good experience. The final kicker is they broke a wheel of my dependable and well constructed roll on bag.",Detractor

"Hamburg to Bangkok via Dubai. Different service experiences. Flight HAM-DXB (EK 60) was on time, First was fully booked. Very good service by 2 attentive FA's and the purser. Wines were outstanding, 40 year old Port, excellent Cognac. Emirates First class food is a bit boring compared to Singapore Airlines and others where you can book your main course in advance. The second leg (EK 384 with A380) was a bad experience. Before take off in DXB I ordered my shower to have it 1.5hrs before landing. I was woken up very rudely by a female FA (she knocked loud on the door of my suite - on all flights before the FA's opened the door and woke up smoothly) and led me to the shower room. Normally in the meantime the FA's clean the suite and change the bed into a seat. When I came back after 20 minutes, nothing had happened, so I called the FA. Unwillingly she did their job and went away. Normally after having the shower the passenger were asked for their breakfast order. My FA was chatting with another pax and when some minutes later I called her and asked for breakfast she looked at her watch and told me, that in about 10 to 15 minutes we would start the descent and she could not serve me. I now asked for the purser and a little later I got my breakfast. The purser later came to me and apologized and told me, that he is not very happy that Emirates needs so much new staff and that today after too short a time FA's can serve in First Class. For me Emirates offers outstanding liquor and wines, the suites and showers are wonderful but it is a lucky draw, what kind of service you can expect in First class. They are growing too fast.",Passive

I travelled on a brand new A380 with terrific new TV screens and new headphones with great sound. The screens are so large that the shape of the seats need to be angled to accomodate them.

On the way out from Manchester they switched the seats I booked 3 months ago - they gave me various reasons like different aircraft - not true - and eventually they moved me nearer to the seats I had booked - why was someone else sitting in the seats I had booked? In an 8 hour flight we had one drinks service and one meal - not enough. On the flight back they switched the seats I booked 3 months earlier - sounds familiar - same excuses - again not true - after stamping my feet they gave me the seats I had already booked.

I was flying Emirates back to Kuwait in Economy Class from Mumbai post minor surgery. There was a long queue at the online check-in counter and therefore approached the Duty Manager to facilitate expedited check-in for medical reasons. I was almost immediately guided to the Business Class counter and was through in minutes. Boarding was smooth and almost on time. Aircrafts (B777) throughout the itinerary looked tired with none having Wide Screen IFE. On Board services were good with cabin crew attentive throughout the flight. Fare was possibly the lowest in spite of last minute booking. Great value for money. Quality and services can be attributed comprehensively on request or when having an issue. Will continue to fly with Emirates as I have been for the past decade or so especially considering the courtesy extended at check-in.,Promoter
"Flew Dubai to Bangkok with Emirates. Second part of a long flight, seated in front cabin of economy class. Good unobtrusive service which helped the cabin stay quiet.

Good entertainment on ICE service. Toilets freshened during the flight.",Promoter
Madrid to Dubai with Emirates. Sat in front cabin of economy row 42. One problem of this row is that because of the curve of the plane the overhead luggage compartment is smaller and normal wheeled cabin bags do not fit in them so bags have to be put further back. Reasonable leg room and very good service from stewards. As the flight was not full we were advised to go to the rear of the plane as there was lots of space there. Excellent selection of entertainment to enjoy. The front cabin is quiet. Ordered special meals and these were delivered promptly and were very good.,Promoter
"In December last year I flew Business Class with Emirates from Brisbane to London with my daughter, her husband and three children - a three year old and twelve month old twins. I knew this was not going to be easy, but in my worst imaginings I hadn't dreamt it would be such a nightmare. Let me apologise to our fellow passengers if they suffered on our account. The babies were booked on bassinet seats with their parents, but were too big to be able to use them. I was a few rows back with the 3 year old, but shared baby duties through the night. Right from before take-off, I could see we were not welcome. As the attendant near me gave the safety demonstration, one of our babies whimpered a little. She rolled her eyes and groaned at the prospect of the voyage ahead. Even with the comfort of lie-down seats, it was very difficult to keep the little ones asleep. So we would take them to the bar area so they could crawl around a bit without disturbing too many people. On two occasions when I was their with our little twin with cerebral palsy, her fingers were stepped on by the same hostess who had made us feel so unwelcome. Towards the end of the long flight to Dubai, we were all exhausted, but not once was there any offer of relief or assistance from the attendants who were standing around chatting amongst themselves. The seventy-two year old granny must have looked a fright as I walked in circles trying to lull the baby off to sleep! Believe it or not, the next leg of the journey was worse, as the seats I was in with the three year old would not recline. On two occasions I sought help. The attendant said she would 'reset' the equipment. This meant the video system also went off for 15 minutes, much to the distress of my little autistic grandson! I didn't see this attendant again. His seat did recline after this, but mine still did not! I tried again - different attendant - same story! I was forced to sit bolt upright all the way. Having outlaid almost $10,000 for Business Class, I was not happy! I would probably have been more comfortable in Economy! I would have thought that an Airline that advertises a high quality experience should be able to do better. They would have known our party was coming on board. One would have thought that for the sake of the other passengers the staff might have offered to help. Emirates always boast about how many different countries the attendants come from. Perhaps they would do better to choose staff with a bit more empathy towards their passengers instead!",Detractor

We arrived at a quiet time in DXB and the staff in the lounge were proactive, refilling drinks. A380 on DXB-AMS leg empty in Business Class which made the bar experience less fun but still a great trip.",Promoter

We paid extra and specifically chose to fly with Emirates, a decision we can never take back. A once in a lifetime holiday started off awfully. One of our meal choices was chicken or beef and after asking for two beef were told only one left - en they went to the two rows behind us and offered beef or chicken.

Obviously passengers expected some breakfast after takeoff but when the breakfast arrived I did not see anyone eating it because what was served was stale. I am surprised why even the airline bothers to serve any food on this sector if there is nobody to check on what is being served. For an airline like Emirates I expect a better standard than other airlines. The connecting flight to Frankfurt was at 8.40 on the A380 and I was pleasantly surprised on the good service by the cabin crew, as well as good food.",Detractor
Emirates Amsterdam to Phuket AMS-DXB on brand new A380 just a few weeks in service and a great crew in Business Class. No Emirates lounge at AMS so took the 35 euro voucher for food and drink airside each instead of using the shared lounge. Great food and drink and early arrival with fast-track. Indeed we were in the complementary chauffeur before the STA of the flight arrival. Everything was well organised. Return chauffeur at DXB on time and another good flight to HKT on a much older 777 but again friendly crew who really wanted to be there. After some negative reviews we were concerned that Emirates had grown too fast and had deteriorated but this was not our experience and we would highly recommend.,Promoter
"Munich to Perth via Dubai with Emirates. Slow and bad Business Class Service. The first drink on MUC-DXB and DXB-PER took ages. Don't ask for a refill - you won't get if because the cabin crew is not able and/or not willing to cope with extra requests. Particularly bad was the meal service on the DXB-PER leg. Food came without any drinks - not even water. When I used the call button a flight attendant showed up after a while and took my order. However, the order never arrived. She came back after - believe it or not - about 30 minutes and explained that thy have not been able to serve my order because ""they were busy with serving the food"". This is ridiculous given the fact that they have a large number of flight attendants in Business Class. Emirates might have a young fleet of aircraft, but their in-flight processes are a disaster and they have no service attitude. They are entirely inefficient. I can only recommend to use the Asian carriers or maybe Qatar Airways when you fly between Europe and Australia.",Detractor
"We flew Emirates from Madrid to Dubai and we were shocked that the 777-300 was configured 3-4-3 on this aircraft and not the standard 3-3-3 as usually found on other airlines who operate the type, this, along with extrememly tight seat pitch made for a very uncomfortable flight. Ground service was good, no delays, no baggage problems and the IFE is excellent. Cabin crew seemed scattered and uncoordinated, the men do the donkey work whilst most of the girls seem to have been chosen for their looks rather than their ability to do the job. Dinner was served over two hours into the flight, ie, almost midnight, reasonable grilled chicken and bean salad starter followed by a choice of roast chicken or ragout of lamb. By the time they got to us they'd run out of the lamb, hardly surprising, so we got chicken for our main course too: dry as a bone, served with some sloppy veg. Breakfast wasn't offered, not even juice, just a choice of coffee or tea. One drinks service before dinner. A huge disappointment after all the hype we'd heard about Emirates. We'll see how next week's return flight goes.",Detractor
"Bangkok to Sydney with Emirates. The check in was good. Lounge was okay if very full, and the absence of flight boards was inexplicable in an airline-dedicated lounge. The food and drink adequate/above average for a small lounge. Boarding was prompt but only because I ignored the staff in the lounge and headed to the gate before the flight was called. I was amongst the first into the cabin but the rest of the Business passengers in the long missed priority boarding, which would have been inconvenient as within a few minutes the economy passengers were queuing through Business. Onboard the Business cabin felt cramped. The 2-3-2 configuration left little room for manoeuvre. There is no sense of privacy and aisle access is poor for many. The overhead locker over my seat was full of spare towels so I had to use another. Virtually no storage space around the seat other than a hole for shoes that was too small to take both of my (average sized) shoes and a front pocket on the back of the seat in front. IFE selection was adequate. Screen was large but situated in the back of the seat in front so the touch screen capability was redundant as it was well out of reach. Oddly there is no feature which stops it being seen from any angle, so in a D seat such as mine I could easily see 7 or 8 other screens. Not great if you have young children as they will perhaps see things you would prefer them not to. Also not great if the person beside you is watching the same movie as you - but has started it earlier. Complicated mini touch screen and separate controller system were not intuitive. I found the seat uncomfortable. Poorly situated armrests were at different levels and the internal one was too small. Very limited position options. The seat does not go fully flat nor to 180 degrees and when lying down I could not stretch out fully - and I am 175cm/5ft 9 inches tall. For me the key issue is the seat and so on this aspect alone I would not normally fly Emirates. The power port is recessed so that it cannot take an iPad or MacBook charger as there is insufficient room. Service was slow, an hour and 15 minutes after takeoff no drinks had been served, this on an overnight flight of 9 hours scheduled duration. Food arrived almost 2 hours after takeoff. It was OK but no more than that. The table is a good size and presentation was good. Service generally was not great. I asked for a second drink and it did not arrive after 10 minutes. Similarly I asked for earplugs from a different attendant which again did not arrive. The complimentary Bulgari washbag is large but contains unnecessary items such as large aftershave bottles - but no earplugs! There were only two toilets for 42 passengers. Definitely insufficient, it only took one person to be 5 mins plus for a long queue to build. The flight attendant apologized and told me that it was always like that. Flight arrived on time. Summary. The product feels like it is at least 10 years out of date. The main issue is the seat and configuration. Well below a Cathay, Qantas, Singapore, JAL or even BA. I understand that the A380 fitout may be better but I'll continue to avoid Emirates.",Passive

"Emirates have gone backwards. Accra to Dubai leg was in a Boeing 777-300er, one flight attendant had a rude attitude whilst the other was great. Unfortunately the rude one was in our cabin. The 777 business class seats are outdated and other airlines have much better seating. Food and service was below average. Dubai to Sydney in an A380, crew were friendly but could not seem to get it together. I was travelling with a partner and food only came to one of us and not together, every single time my food orders were incorrect. Meals are getting smaller and are the same on other routes. Meals were served and wines were poured after meals ended. Comfort wise I was able to get some sleep in the A380 seats. Overall a below average experience with Emirates.",Detractor
"Emirates once more offered a fantastic product, to bring me from Dubai to Frankfurt. The experience started with this unique Emirates chauffeur-Service, dropping me off at Dubai airport, just some steps away from a smooth check-in. Security and passport-control were easy and the lounge outstanding. It is huge, more like a First Class Terminal. It is important to keep in mind, that the airport is quite big, it took 15 minutes to walk from Check-in to the lounge and 15 minutes from the lounge to the gate. Boarding was well organized and efficient. This time, there was no airbridge to the upper deck, but this was not a problem, as the A380 was not fully booked. Priority boarding made it easy to get on the aircraft. Service was outstanding and the crew great, cheerful and friendly. Even when you did not have a meal at the lounge, it is nearly impossible to taste all the delices of the menu. Meal service is on demand, whenever you want it. Comfort is excellent, not only because of the shower and the seat/bed. This aircraft is so quiet! Onboard Wifi worked well during 2/3 of the flight, 500 MB for 1 USD is a fair deal. At Frankfurt, priority delivery of luggage (own belt for First an Business) worked well and with a waiting chauffeur-service, the way home was as easy as it could get. The not really cheap price was nevertheless more than ok for a high-end travel-experience with this unique bling-bling-feeling.",Promoter
"Melbourne to Auckland with Emirates. 30-45 minutes late in takeoff, they said it was due to cleaners, anyway eventually we were allowed to board. The plane was nice, the seats looked comfortable enough and it was certainly clean. The FA's however were conspicuous in their absence. Once boarded, we didn't see them again till we were served a meal. About an hour or so before we landed I asked one FA about landing cards to fill in. She said they had run out of them as they ""never give us enough"" and we would probably have to fill in once we landed however to her credit she called around and found a pile more. Not sure why this wasn't done when they had run out earlier? Anyway that was sorted. They also asked for coin donations to a children's fund, so we had our coins ready but no one came for them. Just odd. The PE was quite good though but as for service, I'd say below par compared to most airlines I have flown.",Passive
"Sydney to Dublin via Dubai, and Emirates have an average to good business class product. Flew both legs on 777 with only issue being the seats are angled lie flat which was a disappointment. Food was good with large portions on both legs, good selection of wines and spirits. Excellent AVOD with the largest selection of movies I have seen on an airline. Staff on both legs were both professional and friendly.",Passive
"Lusaka to Amsterdam via Dubai, the Emirates A340-300 was full and seats pretty cramped. IFE the old type and with the seat of the passenger reclined almost all the way it was not possible to get a good view of the screen. There was no wifi on this flight. The cabin crew seemed disinterested and more busy with themselves than with their passengers. Two crew doing the meal serving were gossiping about a colleague apparently oblivious to the fact that at least 20 pax around them where hearing this. Furthermore an extra order of something that was not on a drinks trolley was acknowledged, but never arrived. Emirates was a great airline with fantastic service but they now need to realize that on the stretch LUN / HRE to Europe there are alternatives.",Passive
"Karachi to Dammam via Dubai with Emirates, and clean aircraft on both legs. Flight attendants cooperative and active. Food was served on the first leg but had only one option. Second leg was delayed due to operational reasons for 30mins, but was advised at DXB. We have 2 hours to kill at DXB. There is a play area at concourse B opposite to patisserie shop which was nice addition in our layover to get my daughter charged up again for the next leg.",Passive
"On 14 January I received an email stating that my flight from Dubai to Panama (EK0251) on 3rd March had been cancelled. I was not given an explanation and I not given suggested options. I phoned the local Emirates office and spent 56 minutes on the phone to try and fix this at my own cost. We were offered a refund, but at this late notice we would not have found affordable alternatives. The first option I was given was to go via Houston and miss my connecting flight from Panama to Quito. The second option was via Sao Paulo. My original flight landed at 16:40 on 4 March. I had booked accommodation in Panama for the night of the 4th to recover from the longest flight in the world. My new flight lands at 6:49am on 5 March. I will now be spending two nights travelling including a layover from 6pm to 2am in the SÃ£o Paulo airport. I was not offered any options to make this less horrible. I was not offered an upgrade on one of the legs or access to a lounge in Sao Paulo. In addition, it was only explained to me after I had agreed to this route change that the flight from Sao Paulo to Panama will be with Copa Airlines - not Emirates. As we are travelling with surfboards, this will cost us money. I wrote a complaint to Emirates and received an email stating that on cases such as these, they are unable to offer lounge access or an upgrade. We spent a lot of time choosing this as the best flight for our trip to get to Ecuador. This new route of Johannesburg, Dubai, Sao Paulo, Panama, Ecuador is not the best option.",Detractor
"Toronto to Dubai, and I always fly on Emirates and everything is great except the attitude of cabin crew. I have a 4 year old and we book his meal in advance - on this very last flight, my food was served and his was nowhere to be found. I talked to three different cabin staff until one finally brought the tray for him! The crew looks at you and says yes, but then they disappear so you have to ask another crew member - and if you are lucky, the third or the fourth one will finally get you what you want! It's such a shame that inflight service is mirroring so bad on the airline. Yes the flights are long and you get tired but you know this when you apply for this job. I enjoy the IFE, food is ok, seats are fine, planes are safe but my only complain is the Cabin Staff attitude and the way they treat the passengers! I hope someone from Emirates looks into this issue!",Promoter
"Gatwick to Hong Kong via Dubai on Emirates. Check in and boarding at Gatwick smooth and departed on time. My pre booked seat was changed to accommodate a family but my reassigned seat was still an aisle which was my preference. The drink trolley took a long time to come around and was followed by the food trolley. Meal was braised beef which was OK, but only lukewarm. The entertinment was OK but headphone socket was dodgy so only had sound in one ear. Landed on time in Dubai but the queues for security were horrendous. Easy transfer to A terminal and the flight on a newer A380 took off about 30 minutes late. Again, trolley service was vey slow and cabin crew seemed to do a poor job. As this was a 3am departure only a sandwich and drink was served before the lights went out. Prior to landing in Hong Kong a hot breakfast was served which was OK. Scrambled egg, baked beans, spinach, veg hash brown. Immigration at HKG took forever then had to wait ages for bags to be delivered to the carousel. All in all, an okay experience but the crew need to sort out the trolley service a bit.",Promoter
"Kuala Lumpur to Heathrow via Dubai, and returning from London Gatwick through Dubai with Emirates, in economy. I am very impressed with the experience on each flight I took. There were no major delays to speak of, the food was actually very good (minus the strange fishy starters), drinks were plentiful and they had a great database of entertainment. The tail mounted cameras are a fantastic feature and the wifi worked well - but only on 2 of the flights. The crew couldn't do enough to help, they were friendly and helpful it was refreshing compared to some airlines I have been on. One downside I found on all flights was that it took over an hour for the FAs to get the drinks trollies and begin service. Each time they started serving from the front of the cabin, which for me was fine as I was at the front - while the people in the back looked on longingly. The check-in staff at Gatwick were really miserable. Other than that, everything was perfect. The first of four legs was on the Boeing 777-300ER with 10 abreast seating. Yes the aisles are a little narrow but as there was nobody next to me it wasn't a problem. I'm 5'11 and 70kg - sat in the aisle seat and wasn't hit very often. Maybe a larger person may feel more uncomfortable, especially if the middle seat were occupied. The other 3 legs on the A380 were better. The seats were roomy and spacious, and on the DXB - KUL route the plane was 10 days old. The flight was empty and there were only about 12 people in a cabin of 120(ish) seats so the crew and I spent half the flight talking as there was little for them to do. 68A was a great seat as it has nobody in front. Overall, very pleased with how well everything went! I look forward to flying with Emirates again very soon.",Promoter
"Melbourne to Kuala Lumpur with Emirates, and I arrived on New Years Day in Kuala Lumpur to discover that my wallet had fallen out of my carry on bag, and the first thing I did on entering the airport was look for it. Staff were unhelpful and the ground crew refused to let me back on the plane to check. I understand this may be policy but nothing was explained. After waiting to no avail I went to collect my luggage, but to my horror no luggage appeared. The staff representing Emirates had no help or a kind word to offer, and could not tell me where my bags were. The best I could do was make my way to my hotel and wait. My bags turned up the following day. On my return flight, accompanied by my partner, we found that they had changed our pre-selected seats and we were not seated together. We did not notice this until we were through immigration, and then had to talk our way back through so that we could convince the check-in desk to re-seat us - a huge waste of time. Waiting for our luggage at Melbourne airport at 2:00am it turned out they had misplaced my luggage again, as well as my partners this time. This led to more time spent at the lost baggage counter, and having to sit at home for the better part of the next day waiting for it to be delivered. All up I would say that I wasted at least 8 hours on unnecessary mistakes, not to mention the distress caused, which was certainly not alleviated by their very unhelpful staff. Inflight was all smiles and complimentary wines, but that does nothing to buy back the time and stress spent on this company.",Detractor
"Frankfurt to Dubai in First class, and chauffeur-service included in the fare, Emirates lounge is okay at Frankfurt but there is no extra space for First-Class-passengers, and it is before security, what you have to keep in mind when calculating the time budget. There was no priority boarding for First Class. That was the only weak part of the trip. Onboard the seat is fantastic, plenty of space and the staff was doing a great job. Meal service on demand was classy, with tasty food and great wine. The lounge in the rear was outstanding with a great ambience. The shower was perfect to get refreshed before arrival. They have Wifi available. 10MB free, 500 for 1 USD only (Credit Card). It was faster than I expected, just okay to send some pictures home. At Dubai, they have a dedicated area for chauffeur-service. It took no time to get a car for the destination.",Promoter
"The staff on my Emirates A380 flight from Dubai to London and the Mumbai to Dubai section of my journey were very good (and return flights). Perhaps there could be a few more of the them on the A380 - it is such a large plane which was full, so service a bit slow. Food was good for economy but the legroom on the Boeing 777 was a bit cramped. Would use them again no problem and they were great with a disabled friend, both the staff on the plane and the ground crew when moving between planes.",Promoter

"Paris CDG to Dubai with Emirates. The chauffer transfer worked well, the lounge was good and I enjoyed the IFE. That is where the positives end. Check in was slow and did not feel I was warmly greeted. Greeting on the plane was neither warm or genuine compared with Singapore Airlines. The cabin crew did not engage and would not make eye contact when walking past. Had to make up my own bed. Food was average and not the best wine selection. Overall, this was not a premium experience.",Detractor
"Flew Durban to Seattle via Dubai on Emirates Boeing 777s. Durban to Dubai was very bumpy almost the entire 8 hours, so cabin service was limited to a single meal and a single drink prior to that meal. Cabin crew were fine, not overly friendly but definitely not hostile. The warm towels were a nice touch. Seat was a not terribly crowded aisle seat in row 41 made all the more comfortable by the fact that the person in front of me did not recline. Thank you! Inflight entertainment offerings were somewhat limited (just 400 channels) but far superior to SAA's offerings. Flight was very full in economy. Dubai to Seattle leg is a long ride: 13 hours over Iran, Russia and the north pole. Cabin service again was very good. The meal was ok",Promoter
"Hong Kong to Glasgow via Dubai with Emirates. The bar was a highlight of the first leg of my flight. The food on Emirates lacks a certain something. Not sure what it is but the menu just doesn't seem inspiring. Beverages on the other hand are plentiful, varied and excellent. My seat on the A380 was comfortable but I feel boxed in on those seats. The one on the 777 was a pain in the butt. I wanted to do some work on the plane but my lights shone into the face of the person seated beside me on the 777. My personal reading light did not work at all. Further to this, the lounge in Dubai is not a pleasant relaxing environment. There are just too many people running around. Not great at 3am when all you want is a good rest. I ended up going down to my gate where everyone was a lot less manic and chilled out on the comfortable long loungers. The chauffeur service was excellent, my driver going above and beyond the call of duty to deliver a great service in Glasgow. My return flight was the contentious one. I'd chosen my seat when booking, an aisle seat because I'm very tall - when I went online to check in, I find my seat has been re-allocated without even being informed. Not an obligation on their part of course but it would be nice to know. Ended up upgrading to business rather than deal with middle seat in economy. In a rare act for one so afraid of flying as myself, I managed to focus on the entertainment for more than ten minutes without losing myself to panic. Managed to watch live football which was a great and pleasant surprise! As it goes, the one leg of economy I had, seated near the front of the bottom deck in economy was the most comfortable and best flight of my itinerary. Great seat.",Promoter
"Auckland to Newcastle via Dubai and I was very disappointed with the service. They had run out of food options so we only had one choice, the staff were unhelpful. My coffee fell off my tray onto my seat, I told the stewardess and she handed me five napkins and walked away. I asked her for another blanket and she never returned, so I asked another stewardess and she walked away. I thought she was coming back so I was reluctant to fall asleep, I sat on my soaked blanket to soak up the coffee on the chair. Half an hour later she didn't return so I had to ask a third member of the crew. The crew were rude about getting the trolleys past us and when they hit a man's foot they didn't apologise. They looked stressed and annoyed during the flight safety announcement. When they brought round the warm towels the stewardess handed one to the person next to me then noticed she had none left to give me. She said ""oh"" and walked away. When another steward came to collect our towels I said I never received one and he frowned, looked around, and walked away. I wasn't spoken to again. Halfway through the flight an alarm went off and a yellow light flashed the stewardesses asked each other ""what does that mean"". I pointed to the screen by the toilets where it said ""smoke detected"". They swore and ran off and came back later to announce ""it was just someone's deodorant"". Finally we were delayed for an hour when leaving Dubai and were not informed why or spoken to, we just watched the flight safety video and an hour later we suddenly took off.",Detractor
"The London-Dubai leg was great because we got an Emirates A380 and it was generally a comfortable experience with minimal bumps. The service was also exceptional with the attendants appearing warm and friendly while the food was decent. The leg from Dubai to Kuala Lumpur was a whole different story. The plane felt old and gaudy. For 4 hours of a 6 hour journey, we were subjected to so much turbulence that it made it terribly difficult to do anything. Nobody could go to the bathroom too and so I spent 4 hours having to hold my bladder in. The passengers lose all sense of comfort and peace of mind when we have to experience a heavily bumpy journey for a protracted period of time. I was assigned seat 21H due to its accessibility to the bathroom. If anyone chooses this seat, I promise you that you would be subjected to people's butts brushing against your arm for the entire flight. I've had the flight attendants rush past me hitting my arm repeatedly without ever apologizing. They would grab your food trays without asking too. The attendants on the A380 were much more polite and pleasant. Their airline ranking must have gone to their heads.",Passive
"Nightmare Emirates flight from Dubai to London. We were on our 2nd leg of our journey from Sri Lanka to UK on 5th January. First the flight was delayed from 4.10 to 5.00. Then 45 mins into the flight we were informed by the Captain that there was a problem with the undercarriage and we would be turning back to Dubai. After dumping fuel and circling for a further 2 hrs in Dubai, we landed back in Dubai at 9.00pm. Then we had to wait in a queue with just 2 people at the counter to get docs to go to a Hotel. It was taking for ever. After collecting docs they were asked to go to yet another counter to leave the duty free items bought. It was utter chaos, children were crying, there were a lot of very tired passengers. Finally after a very long time and the Management woke up to the crisis, they offered food and the business lounge for some of the passengers, which we took up. I am totally shocked at the Emirates response to this incident. No regard to the passengers and what they had gone thru. They had over 3 hrs to organise the vouchers for the Hotels and transport for the passengers. Yet they kept passengers waiting longer with their laidback attitude. Will certainly be thinking twice before booking Emirates again!",Detractor
"New York to Dubai. After having flown with various American airlines over the last 8 months I'm relieved to be back on Emirates. The first class on the A380 is everything it should be. Love the privacy of their suite and comfort of the seat, may it be in an upright position, lounge or as a fully flat bed with a separate mattress which is excellent for sleeping. The catering is on-demand, with an amazing selection of food. I tend to over-eat on such flights for I'm eager to try everything. And drink everything. I wasn't disappointed. Everything I tried was top notch quality and taste. IFE is incredible with an amazing collection of movies and TV shows. And the 32-inch screen is a pleasure to watch. The piece-de-resistance is the shower that sets them apart. The surprisingly disappointing feature on this flight was their internet. Given how heavily they promote online connectivity while flying and the free (or nearly free) service, it is also a frustratingly slow experience. This is something that needs to improve. I simply gave up for the connection was so slow.",Promoter
"Rome to Jakarta via Dubai with Emirates, and terrible in-flight service. Was calling for a flight attendant to help pull the screen from the side of my seat and had to wait for at least 30 minutes before one showed up and that was for the inflight meal service. Then she just stared at me and did not move a muscle until I requested her to help pull out the tv screen. Without waiting for any of us to pull out our tray table, the flight attendant just distributed the lunch trays and they were on our laps. Terrible! Despite asking for an aisle seat for both legs of my journey, I got a middle seat for the second leg of my journey. The ground crew behind the counter failed to tell me that I will get a middle seat as perhaps no other aisle seats were available. Food was so-so compared to a few other airlines I have taken over the years. Overall, I was quite disappointed with my experience, which happens to be my first time with Emirates.",Detractor
"Durban to Birmingham via Dubai return. I have flown three times with Emirates in the past 6 months and been satisfied with the service. However, on the flight from Birmingham to Dubai on 29th December, the ICE system froze which didn't bother me very much. Coupled with that, however, was the fact that our seats could not be adjusted and we had to sleep in an almost upright position. This is not acceptable, particularly as I had paid a premium price for the flight, due to the festive season.",Passive
"Glasgow to Tokyo Narita via Dubai with Emirates, and on both legs of my trip the seat and service provided by the cabin crew was excellent, however there were a few items to mention. The first was that at Dubai we had a 25 minute bus tour of the airport complex from the gate to reach the plane flying the second leg. No real inconvenience but it felt slightly odd to be on the bus driving around for so long. The second issue was with the food that was served on the Tokyo flight. I had the oriental vegetarian meal booked and I genuinely have no idea what the main portion of my meal was. I was served an odd flavorless mush that resembled wallpaper paste which I couldn't eat, so I had to abandon it and instead have some of the pastries the cabin crew brought round with the coffee. I'd recommend using the airline but to avoid choosing my food option!",Promoter
"I have now flown return from Perth to London Heathrow via Dubai with Emirates on two separate occasions, and each trip has been poor. My expectations had been high which is perhaps why each trip has been a disappointment. I have encountered long delays in flight departures waiting on the tarmac on at least half of the legs flown as flights seem to seldom leave on time. The cabin staff are unfriendly and the entertainment selection is the worst I have encountered. You are hard pushed to find a film title you even recognize in the list of new releases. On two occasions my meal choice has been unavailable (despite being seating fairly close to the start of service) and obtaining a drink (water not alcohol) outside of the allocated service times is as if you have asked for the moon on a stick. Meal quality is however pretty good. Seats are generally comfortable and provide ample space for a long haul flight. I have only flown Emirates as Qantas does not operate its own flights out of Perth and I wish to maximize my QFF benefits by flying on a code share flight.",Detractor

The crew were not service oriented and were rude - we waited 2.5 hours before we were offered water or a drink. I had stewardesses telling me ""no"" and ""I am too busy"" so many times. The crew gave the impression that they would rather be anywhere other than serving on that aircraft. Do not bother complaining - they seem to have no customer service team, but an email that will give you a generated standard reply. When I did more digging and calling, they admitted that they do not have a phone number or a team that I could speak to.",Detractor
"Mauritius to Dusseldorf via Dubai. The advantage of Emirates are quite modern aircraft with spacious seats, and attractive pricing for business class. The disadvantage is that you'll have an extra stop-over at Dubai. It looks like that Emirates puts more emphasis on languages spoken onboard by its crew, than the quality of their job performance. On two out of four flights on this vacation, I found that the crew assigned to my section were very professional. The other two flights the crew were sloppy or inadequately trained. On one flight I had to move to another seat because the headrest was broken. (I am quite tall person, and therefore a headrest that is so loose that it immediately drops to the lowest position, is not acceptable for me). When moving to an empty seat a stewardess told me that she had received several reports of seat problems on that flight. Because of the quality of the customer service of Emirates, my overall rating is low. It took one week to get a standard answer to one of the two issues I reported. This standard answer was obvious not applicable to my situation. I then asked for a relevant answer on both issue, but after an month I haven't received any answer at all. Especially for business and first class passengers I would have expected a functioning customer service department.",Detractor
"Bangkok to Sydney with Emirates. The service was robotic at best. The seat was so narrow so much that the person next to me was basically sitting in my lap the entire trip, and legroom was barely enough. The food was very cluttered in choice and tasted bland. For a company that prides themselves on quality of food and service they should share that experience with the entire plane, not just business class. The free WIFI was a bonus but at 10MB was hardly enough in the age of smartphones.",Detractor
"This was my first time flying Emirates. Comfort wise it is quite good for an economy class, seats being relatively wide. In flight entertainment was good and the screen is really large, but the headsets are extremely bad. The food is acceptable, nothing exciting. Cabin staff was efficient and friendly. Seat selection was not available at the time of booking, even though I had paid for a full fare flexible ticket. This resulted in my partner and I being separated during the flight. For that reason, I will avoid flying with them in the future.",Passive
"Colombo to Copenhagen via Dubai return. Emirates advertise that a business class ticket include a hotel in Dubai when you travel through this city and that you pick up the voucher in the airport prior to embarkation. We booked online and at the same time reserved the hotels and received confirmation on the hotels as well as of travel tickets during the booking process. In Copenhagen on the way to Colombo this worked as advertised and we were able to break up the journey into two 5-6 hr flights by staying overnight in Dubai. However, on our return flight no voucher was receivable in Colombo and we were told to pick it up in Dubai. In Dubai we were sent from counter to counter in the very large airport and were finally told that no hotel voucher would be issued. The argument used was that although you book online you have to call the Emirate office afterwards to confirm the booking! Apparently this is written somewhere in the small print of the ""conditions for sale"". In other words you may book online but you can't rely on the confirmation received during booking but have to call the office anyway. So what is the point of having on-line bookings when the information is not valid anyway?",Detractor

The flight seemed very uncomfortable since there was very tight legroom, and also the seat width was a bit narrow due to the 3-4-3 seating layout on this Boeing 777.

Durban to Manchester via Dubai. Very disappointing flight. I'm a frequent flyer and always had faith in Emirates but no more. Departed 28 December from Durban on flight EK776 to Dubai. The area around my seat smelled of urine. My tv screen hung loosely so I could not adjust the angle plus it was sticky to the touch. Cabin staff appeared stressed and smiles were absent. I accepted that sometimes stuff happens and maybe Emirates had experienced some hiccups that evening. However when I was served with a very stale soggy chicken bun and inedible old chocolate brownie I felt most disgruntled. Even economy flight tickets are expensive and I left that flight most unhappy.,Detractor

The lounge in Hong Kong was adequate but busy with no separate area for first class passengers. Onboard, the seat is amazing with it's own bar and an ability to close yourself in the suite. Very good. My wife was in 4K however, and that was a noisy seat with a lot of galley noise, not really first class! Food was disappointing with overcooked chicken and half of the menu items not even offered. At no time was I offered cheese or chocolates which are on the menu. The lights in the shower suites were not working and the flight attendant opened the door once when my wife was in there using the toilet. Inflight entertainment was impressive, but the remote for my seat stopped working half way to Bangkok. All in all, a very good seat not backed up by a first class experience.",Passive
"Gatwick to Mauritius via Dubai. Packed flights on the A380 there and back. Service seems to take ages. The food out of Gatwick was revolting but on other sectors was good especially the fish coming out of Mauritius. Found it odd that they serve food first and then come round with drinks as it means you've finished eating before you get a drink. The food needs to be hotter, mine was barely warm enough. The crew on the Boeing 777 coming back to LGW seemed more efficient and friendly than any of the A380 crews. The IFE is outstanding on Emirates, so much to choose from. The drawback for flying on Boeing 777 for me was having to be bussed to some remote stand at Dubai, it took ages to get to the plane. It seems that the A380's get the airbridges and the B777's have all been kicked out to the back of beyond. The low rating for WIFI is because I didn't use it.",Passive
"My husband and I flew Emirates from Lusaka to Dubai, on the way to China during mid September. We are Platinum and Gold card holders respectively, and frequent fliers of Emirates on the Lusaka-Dubai route on Business class. We were upgraded from Business Class to First Class for this specific flight, and were appalled at the quality of the A340 Premium products. For all the wonderful advertisements (and personal experiences) on premium products on the A380s and B777s, the product on the LUN-DXB sector is something that definitely needs to change. Business Class seats themselves are not fully flat beds, only the old cradle seats, hence was pleased to be upgraded to First Class, but we weren't aware of what was coming. We got First Class seats where the recline and leg rests were not working. Hence was made to stand and wait 20 minutes in the aisle while the flight attendants tried to manually recline our seats. Although this was done, the leg rest was not able to be manually reclined, hence was given boxes, yes boxes and pillows in order to rest our legs. For one of the so called best airlines in the world, that is completely unacceptable. This is something that no one should experience on First class, especially if someone pays the very high fares Emirates offers. To make things worse, when complaining through email to Emirates, we got a response saying ""technical faults can develop at any point,"" implying that even if you pay more for a Business/First class seat, there is no guarantee that you will get a good seat on Emirates.",Detractor

Even though the plane took off from Colombo more than half empty they still didn't want to give the upgrade experience for their customers.

"Flew Brisbane to Auckland return on Emirates A380's. We were delayed on the tarmac in Brisbane for the Brisbane - Auckland flight due to the power shutting down on the plane when taxiing back from the gate. The pilot said he had to reset some computer settings and then the power came back on. Then as we were taxiing, he stopped and advised that the water system wasn't working. So he was going to do some resetting on the tarmac to see if the computers could reset the water supply. After about an hour of this, he went back to the gate to have engineers look at it (another 45 mins or so) and finally we were on our way 2 hours late. It wasn't very comforting to hear the pilot not finish sentences on occasion when giving us updates - it was as though he drifted off! Also, my husband's headset was broken, he asked for a new one but unfortunately a new headset never arrived. If it had been a longer flight, he would have followed this up. The food was pretty cold due to the delay, and there was the rudest male cabin supervisor I've ever come across. I went to ask for some water from the galley (as after the service, the cabin crew do a pretty good job of disappearing to avoid being asked for service I guess). I was standing there for a few minutes and he knew it, and he never even asked how he could help. I had to ask him! He basically ignored me and was generally grumpy when and unsmiling when he did go up and down the aisle during the service. The way back was much better with friendlier cabin crew, a coherent pilot and a plane that had no issues apart from my headset jack not providing stereo this time. The food was fine this time too.",Passive
"Los Angeles to Johannesburg via Dubai. Everything was as expected. The only downside on the entire trip was lack of Wi-Fi. Given that we were flying over the North Pole on the first leg, I can understand it, but it is still something Emirates should work on for the long haul flights. The leg from DXB to JNB was on a 777. Not as nice as the A380, but still great. They woke us up to feed us, which I thought was a nice touch, although I could see some people not liking it. I think the biggest problem with Emirates business class is that there's really no need to fly first class. The Business Class experience was better than the First Class trips I've had.",Promoter
"Dubai to Orlando, seat 37K paid AED8045 for my ticket. Emirates 16 hour flight - inadequate feeding arrangements I plan to pack a snack pack on the return flight from Orlando. Meal served soon after take off was satisfactory. Then pizza soon after, which I declined because I wasn't hungry. 4 hours before landing I requested a piece of fruit or a dry cracker, the menu suggested that these snacks are available between meals. I was told that there was nothing left, ""everything has been demolished"" I was told by a steward. Whilst I understand the limitations of food on board, I would expect something small to snack on for a flight of this length. Eventually, after saying how astounded I was, one of the stewards said they knew where a stash could be found! Why was it not readily available anyway? He gave me two small packets. Worse still, every cup of coffee I had was lukewarm so I asked for tea, that was worse, it looked like dish water, the colour was not tea! The icing on the cake, I asked for a drink of fruit juice an hour and a half before landing and the steward said there was none available because it was all packed away! I am astounded and disgusted.",Passive
"Auckland to Manchester via Dubai. Nice to report on a positive experience with Emirates. Check-in quick, lounge access OK but a bit crowded. Flight from Auckland very good, food and drink choices excellent, even managed some sleep. Business class bar was well occupied. Second flight from Dubai to Manchester even better as we were given a First class upgrade and we appreciated the increase in the luxury level, with the food, drink and shower. Baggage claim and driver service super quick. All in all an excellent experience.",Promoter
"I am a regular traveler between Dubai and Los Angeles and notice if there is any improvements made on this route since the last trip in June 2015. Overall journey was pleasant, departure was nearly half-an-hour late due to offloading luggage of passengers who could not travel that day, but the captain promised to make up the time lost throughout the flight. Arrival was on time as scheduled. A380 a joy to travel in. What could be better is if the departure gate in Dubai allows for 2 level entries, as premium passengers were boarded through the lower entry door, which could be problematic for elderly passengers as they have to go up on a stairs to the business cabin. Male amenity kit bag has been shrunk which is good. The content remains the same. The service is good with crew members working hard. A minor tweak on the menu since the last time and improvement was noticed in this flight. Poach eggs served on the breakfast menu in this flight has improved since the last flight I took. Wifi still not really working. Due to recent event in San Bernardino, I was held up at the LAX immigration, due to the origin of my travel was from an Arab country. After all the searches completed 5 hours later, I exited LAX and could not found the limousine driver. However, I can not really put the blame on Emirates, as me being held up by the LAX border protection was something that none of us planned for. Keep on improving Emirates, your passengers notice and appreciate them.",Promoter
"I paid a little more to take the A380 from Paris to Dubai. This aircraft is really comfortable: quiet and wide. Entertainment system is one of the best I saw, and the food pretty good. But the transit in Dubai was a nightmare. The airport itself is good, but the connecting time was way too long. The A380 was parked on the tarmac and unloaded by bus! I thought Dubai was Emirates hub, but they use buses to unload these aircraft. 20 minutes drive to get to the terminal. I thought the bus drove us downtown. And it was the same for the connecting flight - very disappointing.",Passive

Flight Departed on time. Again I say this. EK crew quality has come down a lot. Most of them just seem to be there for glamour and stand around like robots. IFE good. Food very bad. Arrived on time. Bags out on time. Good value for money based on price paid. Would I go out of the way to fly even though I am a GOLD Member. No I will think twice.",Passive
"I flew on the Emirates A380 and really enjoyed this trip in economy. Unfortunately there were some queues at Dubai Aurport. But the service in the plane was fantastic. I couldn't really notice a big difference between the A380 and the Boeing 777-300. I think that the A380 is quiter, it looks better and feels bigger. Food and entertainment system (ICE) amazing. Very big selection of music and movies in different languages. Great staff. I really enjoyed this flight.",Promoter
"Milan to Dubai with Emirates. The service for economy class was very good. Very fast check-in at Malpensa Terminal 1, no queue. Boeing 777-300er looked new, seat was comfortable with a quite big screen and USB. Headphones and blankets were distributed and the menu in economy was a nice touch. I enjoyed the entertainment system: lots of music and movies available in different languages. There was only 1 meal service during this flight, which was vey good. Shortly before landing a snack was served, you could choose from ice cream and hot cookies. The crew was nice and helpful, they smile and it seems like their are happy to serve you. Really nice product for 6h flight.",Promoter
"Flew Emirates from MAN-DXB, outbound flight 02/12/15. Excellent service by the crew on the morning flight from Manchester, the 777 was an older aircraft so the entertainment system was the older ICE system but it worked well with plenty of choices of movies, TV programmes and music. Wi-Fi available on this aircraft and it worked well for the bargain price of a $1.00. Meal service was a let down as the food was cold and the portions seemed to have shrunk since my last flight with Emirates last year. Plenty of drink runs available and the flight was only half full so plenty of space available. Landed in to Dubai 20 minutes earlier. I much prefer the 777 over the A380.",Promoter
"Flew Emirates DXB-MAN, 07/12, afternoon flight on the A380. On boarding the aircraft we were greeted by miserable cabin crew so got the feeling it wasn't going to be a great flight and we were correct. The flight took off on time and it was a full flight so knew the service would be slow but waiting 90 minutes after take off for any refreshment is poor by Emirates standards. No pre dinner drink just the food and then another wait for drinks. Crew were surly and clearly didn't want to be at work that day. Asked for another drink to be grunted at by the stewardess who moaned she would have to write my drink down as a few people were asking. If they had been pro active and commenced a drinks service before the food maybe people wouldn't be asking for another drink so soon after the meal. Cabin crew then disappeared and not offered anything else until 2 hours before landing when they came round with afternoon tea. A very small sandwich and a tiny scone. The aircraft was immaculate as it was only 3 months old. Flight landed 40 minutes early. I would fly Emirates again but would avoid the A380 where possible.",Passive
"We couldn't have asked for a better ending for a week long vacation in the UAE, as we flew back to India on an Emirates A380. I was glad that all the excitement paid off with this flight. EK500 operating on the DXB-BOM sector had already occupied its gate (B20), even before we cleared our formalities. The flight, needless to say is big and the number of people waiting to get on board is a clear sign of that. The cabin crew on board were polite and never dropped their smile throughout the flight duration. The legspace gets in more inches than a B777 (that we used for BOM-DXB) and the windows seem more larger. The night time ambient lighting adds to the drama with all the buttons overhead at the touch of a remote. The in-flight entertainment provides all the details of the flight and the most amazing outdoor camera locations one can ask for during the flight. The food was pretty good, if not exceptional and we were more than happy with the fact that it was piping hot. The cabin is very quiet once the Rolls Royce's are burnt at full throttle and you can hardly feel any vibrations. I would recommend everyone flying to Dubai to at least once experience their A380 aircrafts.",Promoter
"I have been traveling Emirates since 2005 and have found that the inflight service has been going downhill over the past 2 years. On 9th December, I flew from Mumbai to Dar Es Salaam via Dubai. I was extremely disappointed with the staff attitude. I found that the table was dirty and had food and tea/coffee stains on it. I brought this to the attention of the staff and they were completely indifferent towards it. They gave me a wet tissue and asked me to clean it myself. On my next flight from Dubai to Dar Es Salaam my vegetarian meal was given away to another passenger.",Passive
"Paris CDG to Dubai. It was the first time we had flown with Emirates and we had a very easy trip. Staff pleasant, food good, flight on time. Seats comfortable. As it was a daytime flight we did not attempt to sleep but have no reason to think as a bed the seats would be as comfortable. A slightly strange layout in business class. Seems to be more directed at solo travellers.",Promoter
"Our flight (EK507) got delayed by an hour and it left quite a sour experience at the start of our vacation. The aircraft was well maintained and the crew were quite welcoming right from the door. The food served on board was of decent quality, but they ran out of the non-vegetarian course by the time the trolley reached my seat. We landed around 45 minutes after our schedulued arrival, and we missed our connecting bus (Emirates shuttle) to Abu Dhabi, as it left sharp at 7 PM. The surprising part about all this is that Emirates dont take any liability for missed bus connections, as it is apparently hosted by a 3rd party. I hope that in future Emirates do take this flaw in account, so as to make sure that passengers missing the bus connection due to a flight delay are not inconvinienced.",Passive
Karachi to New York via Dubai. Best flight I have experienced. The staff was very nice and cooperative. They have the best entertainment system with the latest collection of movies. The food is okayish and better than many airlines. The planes are also new. I should mention that Dubai Airport is the best airport I have visited.,Promoter
"We choose Emirates from CDG to PVG via DXB because of the cheap price and it had been recommended to us. However, I did not really enjoy this experience. The food is some of the best in economy class. But the IFE screen needs improvements as it is not as clear as some other airlines. The cabin crew service from Dubai to Shanghai was rude and impatient. Furthermore, the seat was not that comfortable, the space was acceptable, but the quality of the seat was poor - the headrest was made of the same material as the lazyback instead of artificial leather, so, if you put you head on it for a long time, you hair would stick to the headrest. Overall, a so-so flight.",Detractor
"The flight from Brisbane to Singapore was very good. Friendly and helpful staff. We had an annoying 75 minute stop in Singapore with a change of crew before the flight to Dubai. The whole demeanour of things changed. The new crew members on the whole seemed rude and abrupt. A young woman travelling on her own was not allowed a bassinet for her young child, whereas she had experienced no problems Brisbane to Singapore. I took up the advocate's role but to no avail. I asked to speak with the Purser but was brushed off. I do not intend flying Emirates again once this holiday is over.",Detractor
"Recently flew Emirates from Christchurch to Stockholm, returning from Barcelona. We stopped at Sydney and Bangkok both directions. All flights were on time. The flight attendants were professional and attentive with lots of water runs between meals. Some crew were friendlier than others but you get that with every airline. The meals were great, and we got our choice on each sector. The food was tasty and varied. There have been some bad reviews regarding the 3x4x3 layout, but this wasn't a problem for us, the width of seats similar to other airlines. The aisles may be a bit narrower. Connection times were good but Dubai airport is a zoo and certainly not relaxing at all, most of the time you have to battle your way through a sea of humanity. Emirates was good value, will fly with them again.",Promoter
"Emirates First Class from Bangkok to Hong Kong. Short hop, so no full First Class amenities available (no limo, amenity kits, First Class bar). Check in at BKK was smooth, lounge was nice, small, but with a decent selection of hot and cold food, and alcohol. Half-full cabin. Nice and chatty cabin crew, but the service seemed quite rushed. Excellent champagne, food just ok - appetisers were very cold, main course was nice, but presentation was below expectation. Suite experience, toilet with shower, and nice cabin crew made our day. Good value for money on this short sector.",Promoter

"I was very pleased with the service I received on Emirates. Everyone was professional, attentive and able to handle situations with difficult passengers easily. The food was good and a lot of it. There were two meal services and a pizza service in between the meals. Drinks offered frequently. The seats were comfortable and a lot of legroom. The stars on the ceiling of the plane when it is dark outside was a nice touch. On my flight to Dubai from New York the plane was half full, so most people went to their own row and stretched out to sleep. On the way back from Dubai to New York the plane was full, but I still felt comfortable for the almost 16 hours I was on the plane. IFE was very good and I was able to finally catch up on watching movies I had not yet seen. The only small problem I had was that the free wifi was not working on my phone, but other people seemed to connect to the wifi easily. I would fly Emirates again without hesitation.",Promoter
"Flew Emirates from Melbourne to Kuala Lumpur on 18th of November 2015. Overnight flight, booked flight through Qantas website. Flight was on Boeing 777-300 (A6-ECV). Upon boarding, FAs greeted passengers. Once seated, hot towel was distributed. After take off a refreshment was provided. I ordered a lacto-ovo diet and in my past experience, I was given sandwich and some dessert/cake, however this time I was a bit disappointed that I was only given 1 piece of vegetarian rolls. Breakfast was served about 2 hours before landing, and the best onboard breakfast that I have had. Emirates also provide stickers so flight attendants know whether to wake up or not. Inflight entertainment was superb, plenty of choices and the front/bottom aircraft camera view was available. The ICE on this aircraft hasn't been upgraded yet (wasn't ICE widescreen) but still enjoyable. Wi-fi was also available in this flight for those who prefer browsing to watching the IFE, and the connection speed was pretty fast. Apart from during take off and landing, mobile phone were allowed to be used onboard. The seat was comfortable and the headrest is adjustable. Flight attendants were friendly. Cabin and toilet was clean. The cabin mood lighting was nice. Combs, razor and toothbrush/toothpaste availabe in the lavatory.

"Mumbai to New York JFK via Dubai. Every time I fly with Emirates their service seems to be on a decline. Dubai to New York their meal service was horrible. They provided a menu which they usually do with 3 options. However the vegetarian option in the menu (both breakfast and lunch) was available only for those who had pre selected meal preferences. Not sure how it makes sense to include something in the menu when it is not really available for selection. Secondly, their flights are freezing cold and flight attendants always seem to be in a hurry to collect blankets. On one leg of the journey they collected blankets one hour prior to landing in a freezing flight. Not a pleasant flying experience overall and not worth the cost of tickets.",Detractor
"Cape Town to Auckland via Dubai and Brisbane in Emirates first class. Decided to splash out. Paid just over NZD 13000 which seemed like a good deal. Flight out of Cape Town was uneventful - staff great, older aircraft but nice inside, Cape Town BIDVest lounge absolutely horrible. Arrival at Dubai is at 1am and the airport is buzzing at that time of the morning. Lounge very big and spacious. Priority fast track means nothing at Dubai. It doesn't help to show it or anything, everyone just seems to use the same lines for security. Flight to Brisbane early morning 10am departure on A380, Very new aircraft. Seat fantastic and showers just great! Staff was a bit of a miss, food pretty good though. Transit at BNE very efficient, lounge is great with lots of food options. Flight to Auckland on same aircraft, different staff and they were the best out of all the staff I had. Very attentive and caring. Flight to AKL a short hop but very nice experience. AKL immigration a pain as 3 Emirates A380s arrived in the space of 40mins. Overall the experience was nice but as past experiences have showed me Emirates staff remain a hit or miss situation at best.",Promoter

Karachi to Boston via Dubai with Emirates. I had a very disappointing experience with Emirates. I have been a travelling musician and always travel with my guitar. Having always put it close to me in the plane I always travel with a softcase. This time I travelled to Boston I was coerced at Karachi airport and given absolutely no choice but to check in my guitar. Knowing the fragility of a guitar it is unacceptable to check it in regardless of all fragile handling protocol an airline may have. A guitar is too sensitive to be checked in. Upon arriving at Boston my guitar was nowhere to be found at baggage claim and after filing a claim it reached me a few days later. And when I unzipped my case I noticed my guitar's headstock is fractured and the guitar received dents regardless of Emirates ensuring fragile handling.,Detractor
Singapore to Chicago via Dubai with Emirates. The crew were impatient and demanded to take away all the blankets 45mins prior to landing. Passengers were rudely awaken from their sleep during this freezing red eye flight and had blankets taken away. The crew then proceeded to collect all headsets in a very rude manner. I assume all these is to help turn around the aircraft quicker but this results in a very horrible flying experience. Not to mention the food is also cold and of poor quality. I have had experience with many other airlines around the world and this is certainly the worst service and worst food ever. I will never take Emirates again. For similar value I would choose Qatar airways.,Detractor
Delhi to Melbourne via Dubai. Check in good and fast and the Delhi Lounge not bad. Flight out of Delhi was delayed and cancelled due to technical reasons. Delhi airport staff do not know how to handle a crisis. Passengers were left high and dry. Hotels and/or comfort was not provided to passengers in a reasonable manner. Replacement flight EK8515 left Delhi 20 hrs later. Crew on the replacement flight pretty bad. Food on board Emirates flights is very poor now. EK406 to MEL. Flight departed and arrived on time. IFE not bad. Wifi advertised was slow and bad. Bottom line is that Emirates is suffering from over expansion. The airline has lost common grip and basics of customer care. Being a Gold member with EK I am looking elsewhere now.,Detractor
"Manchester to Sydney via Dubai. This was my fifth return journey facilitated with Emirates. Myself and my wife prefer travelling with Emirates, due to their flexibility around routes out of Manchester and previous experience of flying with Emirates from London Heathrow and Gatwick via Dubai to Mauritius. The meals in Economy class have deteriorated in my view. The portions are much smaller and needs reviewing by Emirates. I purchased $1 of wifi access, and its reliability was poor at times, and cannot be relied upon. On a positive note, we flew on the new 2 class Airbus A380 (A6-EOP) and the flight was good (with the exception of meals). They did regularly offer drinks and snacks throughout the flight - this was not observed on the other three Emirates flights.",Passive
"This is my 6th Business class trip this year with Emirates. Checking was done in Melbourne by Qantas, all went smoothly. The EK lounge in Sydney is a nice and cosy. Great food and service. Boarding the flight was a nightmare, there was no priority lane in place, it was a dogs breakfast. I have never encountered that before on any airlines. After take off, we were given mattresses straight away - how about asking priority passengers what they would like to drink after take off and what their meal requests would be? That was a first. The crew always give the mattresses after dining. Just very strange and not logical. I was seating in 7K which was located at the very front section of the business class. After a long 1h30, we were given our departure drink and cold nuts, then asked to chose our dinner. No wine request was offered with the meal, we had to ask for it. I've asked for my cheese platter to be served after I finish my main meal. I got my starter, the chicken roulade and salad - I had to send back my meal, the whole food that I just got was far too chilled. There were pieces of ice on the Salad and the chicken, I just couldn't believe what was served on my plate. No coffee or tea were offered to my section, no refill of our drinks or bread and I never got my cheese platter. By that stage, I've had enough. 2 hours before landing, I've ordered a Lite Bites, waited only 5 minutes which I thought was pretty amazing considering during the flight I've had to press the Call Button 3-4 times to get some water (then asked for a big bottle therefore I was sure to have the water when I needed it and without disrupting the crew) well my snack was cold so I had to send it back again! The crew who were designated to look after my section really failed on that flight, they were non existent during the flight, didn't care one bit about their passengers. I'm starting to get very annoyed with Emirates, every time it's a win or a miss but over my 6 business trips this year it has been a miss.",Detractor
"Melbourne to Rome via Kuala Lumpur & Dubai. My husband and I booked a trip to Italy with our two young children. The flight is around 21 hrs not including transfers & upon recommendations from several friends we decided to travel with Emirates. I do not have one good thing to say about them! We experienced every family's worst fears about international plane travel with everything from poor, slow service, judgemental staff, pathetic kids meals (the kids were served spaghetti bolognaise on 5/6 flights), rude staff refusing to give the kids their 'complimentary' toy (which we had to beg for!), and to top it all off we had all been separated on one flight, despite booking our seats online. My four year old son and seven year old daughter were sitting 10 and 15 rows away from myself with my husband sitting another 7 rows behind me! All up we were spread right through the economy cabin and no-one wanted to help us, each blaming the next point of transfer as the responsible party. Originally I made an online complaint to Emirates while on holiday, hoping at the bare minimum, they'd be able to offer some palatable food to our children inflight. The response I got, as well as being ridiculously late and outside the timeframe given, was pathetic",Detractor
"My husband and I purchased tickets for $38,000. to fly first class on Emirates from San Francisco to Johannesburg via Dubai. It was going to be our ""trip of a lifetime"" so we spent the extra money to try the first class experience we had heard so much about. We boarded the plane and were served drinks, but about an hour later we had to de-plane due to an electrical failure. We waited in the airport and were given hourly updates for the next 5-7 hours while we waited to board again and take off. Eventually the flight was cancelled. We got no information at the airport from Emirates about what to do, where to go, or how to rebook. After several more hours getting our bags and finding our way out of the airport we bumped into a fellow passenger who told us Emirates would pay for a room at a local hotel. We went to the hotel and were not able to get information about rebooking our flight until 2:00 am. The flight went out the following day but involved 2 hours of waiting in line to get checked in. My husband is blind and I had one leg in a cast so the delay was really excruciating. We were awarded 100,000 Skyward miles for the inconvenience. The delay caused us to lose out on the first day of our Safari which cost us roughly $2000, and we could not recoup. I wrote a letter to Emirates saying that we understood these mechanical problems do happen but given the cost of our ticket we wanted better compensation. I got a polite letter back telling us basically ""no"" that they had done all they were going to do, and that was the end of it. I was pretty stunned at that response given that after having paid $38,000.",Detractor

We were 2 hours into the flight before we were offered a drink and even then the stewardess seemed uninterested. The food was bland and repetitive. There were two options with one always being chicken. There was never enough of the second meal choice option. The seating was comfortable with good legroom. Entertainment was okay but the same on each connecting flight. Some screens also failed on the plane causing complaints. On a whole, an average experience for the price.",Passive
"I travelled on Emirates with my wife and 2 month old baby from London to Lahore via Dubai return. Our bassinet seats were changed on all flights apart from Heathrow to Dubai despite having reserved and requested bassinet seats. The staff attitude was terrible as our seats were changed at Dubai and they just would not give me a reason despite asking on a number of occasions to why they have changed our seats, upon checking my reserved seats once boarded only to discover another couple with a child sitting in our reserved seats. On return flight from Dubai to London we were told a number of times we had got my bassinet seats as reserved even up until the point we was boarding. When we boarded the plane we had recieved seats 1 behind the Bassinet seats - so I complained and nothing was done about it. However, a nice passenger in one of the bassinet seats gave his up so my wife could sit there with the baby, he and many others around could not understand why we had been changed and people not needing bassinet seats given them. I have flown with Emirates for many years, but this was by far the worst trip ever in terms of staff attitude and making this journey more difficult than needed be especially whilst traveling with a 2 month old baby. I won't travel with Emirates again after this journey.",Detractor

What a relief to change from Qantas to Emirates on our flight from Dubai to Brisbane. Seats in Row 57F/G chosen and were comfortable. The cabin crew were friendly and efficient and treated people like people. Meals were excellent and the gluten free options were the best my partner has had on a flight with one exception. A snack (pizza) was served late at night but there was no gluten free snack. The crew asked if fruit or something else could be provided. Flight was on time. After flying with Qantas for 20+ years I'm switching to Emirates.,Promoter

The flight was on time and online check-in was fast and easy. I would fly Emirates again.",Promoter
Manchester to Doha via Dubai return with Emirates. We arrived at the airport to find that the plane had been changed and our seats that we had carefully selected had been changed - with us scattered all over the place. This is not just an inconvenience but made worse when you are travelling with children - other cheaper airlines have noticed that we are travelling with children and have made sure we are seated together even when we have not paid extra for this (like Thomas Cook). The ground staff managed to find us seats together in the end but much further back in the plane. To make it worse they did the same thing on the way home on our Doha to Dubai flight. This time I checked just before we left and rang them - they could only seat 4 of us together and the rest were scattered. When I got home I emailed them to complain and after a long time got a reply to say that this is just how it is. I expected better for a company that sells itself as having good service and are so expensive. Its a sad day when I get better service from a holiday company chartered flight compared to Emirates. After all the messing about spoiled the flight - this is one of the best parts of the holiday for my family. If a family aren't seated together it doesn't matter what film you show or food you give.,Detractor

"Jakarta to Paris via Dubai with Boeing 777 from Jakarta to Dubai and A380 from Dubai to Paris. I was impressed with the cabin interior. The seat color was calm yet it still gave something confident. Before take-off, the flight attendants gave the menu to all passengers. Jakarta-Dubai flight was served with two meals. I was surprised with the flight attendant that has different languages, 18 in total, this would be very helpful with the passenger who couldn't speak English very fluently. The meal for me was standard, as I could find a meal better in other airlines. I hope I could get better meal in my next flight to Paris since I thought the flight would use A380, but it was still the same. The flight attendant seemed so hurried in serving the meals. The meal to Paris was served a bit later until dinner time, and I was like starving since they didn't give us more snack. The best thing in the flight was the IFE. And it also had the camera that was very interactive.",Promoter
"Flying back to Jakarta from Amsterdam via Dubai. The flight from Amsterdam was more or less the same as the flight from Dubai to Paris with A380. But the flight attendant from Amsterdam to Dubai was a bit unprofessional. I asked to have my headset replaced, but it didn't come until I asked another FA. During meal time, I saw an old couple not get the meal. When everyone had half of his meal, they still don't get the meal. IFE was good during the whole flight. The flight Dubai to Jakarta (Boeing 777) was not as good as I had thought. For almost 1/3 of the journey I could not sleep on my seat. The fleet was different when I flew from Jakarta to Dubai before. This flight looked old. The IFE screen even made me not want to watch. The legroom was also a bit narrow.",Passive
"Dusseldorf to Bangkok via Dubai with Emirates. Excellent service provided. Ground staff in DUS a bit slow, would recommend no online check in since only one counter for the whole group of online check in's. Boeing 777 a bit old, but motivated and friendly staff. A380 turns out to be the first plane I can even sit in a middle seat and actually sleep. Not extremely good but at least I can place my legs somewhere.",Promoter
"Emirates from Durban to Auckland via Dubai and Brisbane. The first flight from Durban to Dubai I cannot fault. Comfy seats, where I requested to be sat online. Great onboard entertainment, clean and really friendly, positive staff. Food was delicious and plenty to drink. My flight from Dubai to Brisbane was not so great. Second lot of security before getting on the plane that wouldn't allow me to take my water bottle that I had brought at the departure gate. Not in the seat I had allocated online for. Admittedly the rest of my negative experience I can't blame Emirates for. But I do think they should get rid of the ability to put the seat so far back. I basically had the guy in front on my lap the whole way, and I was trying to sleep by leaning on the fold up tray, when he forced his seat right back - it resulted in a limb on my head and a cricked neck. This was then followed by screaming kids for most of the 14hr flight. However due to lack of being able to sleep the aircraft did have brilliant inflight entertainment. Particularly enjoyed the cameras mounted out side the plane that you can watch.",Passive
"London to Kuala Lumpur via Dubai with Emirates. Inflight entertainment was wonderful with many selections to choose from. Food was rather okay too, considering I ordered a gluten free meal. The seat was hard to sleep in and the cabin was sometimes too cold. I needed to use a couple of blankets on these flights as it was just too cold. Service was below average. Asked for orange juice and water twice from two different cabin crew, but it never showed up. I had to go to the galley myself to take the drinks because no one attended to my call.",Passive
"New York JFK to Milan. I've flown the Emirates A380 on short haul flights from BKK to HKG in First Class which is a noticeable improvement over the Business Class product. As many write, there are a number of seats in the Business Class cabin that are much worse than others. I did my homework before selecting the outbound seats. Per recommendation (traveling with a significant other), I picked seats 20 E/F that had the mini bar on the aisle, which allows you to sit closer to your friend/partner/spouse. The problem with these is that our middle armrests were so small and narrow that really only one of us could use it at a time. On our flight back to New York we opted to sit apart and chose seats 18K and 20K. These seats have the mini bar on the aisle, and you do have a nice more private experience. The huge plus of these seats is that you get lots of storage space next to your seat under the windows that is nonexistent in the other middle seat configurations (E/F and D/G). This allows you to put away your laptop bag, blanket etc, without getting up into the overhead bins during flight. This would also be the case for the ""A"" seats on the other side of the plane. We found these much more comfortable and didn't mind sitting apart for the flight. The flight attendants are very hit or miss with Emirates. On our outbound JFK-Milan flight, most were pretty bad. Not particularly helpful or available. They disappear after the very rushed dinner service. On our return flight the good FAs outnumbered the bad. The thing that agitated the most on both flights is the disregard that the attendants have for being quiet. They love to congregate and talk loudly between sections behind row 21. As well, they seemed to always getting into the overhead bins and slamming them shut. This woke me us several times. The other thing that I disliked is that the restrooms are next to the galley in the back of the Business class cabin in such a way that it almost seemed unsanitary and without privacy. You have the toilets between the lounge/bar with uncovered food, and the galley where they are preparing food. With no curtain separating the toilet section from the galley section, you have a bunch of FAs standing around on one side and guests in the bar area on the other that you must walk through to get to and from the toilet. We found the food offering pretty subpar for a business class product. The beverage service and offering was above average.",Passive
"Sydney to Bangkok with Emirates. I was unhappy with the Check-In staff member who mistakenly added the weight of my carry-on cabin bag to my Checked luggage, requiring me to repack my bags, but when I eventually got back to (different) check-in desk my checked luggage was well under the 30kgs allowed, so I ended up checking both bags and carrying the plastic bag that I was going to post as my carry-on. The difference between the two service staff was marked - this is the second time this has happened. The meals on Emirates in Economy have deteriorated in the last year or so, probably because Emirates operates a codeshare arrangement with Qantas on this route, so they are maybe catering to Qantas customers. The cabin staff are very professional and helpful, The beer on board is supermarket class offering a Dutch and USA option with a Dutch light alternative rather than options from Oceania or Asia which I would prefer, still the staff offer options rather than just what is close to hand. The wine is quite reasonable given it is cool and drunk at altitude. The in-flight entertainment is superior unless the person in front insists on fully reclining their seat even during meals which makes viewing the screen extremely unpleasant, but this is probably more a reflection on the type of passenger Emirates attracts with their code share arrangement with Qantas than on the actual seat.",Passive
"Emirates A380 provides you with excellent flat-bed seat with great privacy, best IFE around, and good drinks. The onboard bar/lounge is a nice to have, and fun place to go for a walk. Quality of the FAs is unpredictable, had some outstanding ones while others were really sub-par. Catering on EK business class is below quality offered by QR economy class, but I do not fly for the food experience. Just give me a superior seat/bed, the better IFE, and a global routes network.",Promoter

Durban to Gatwick via Dubai. The Emirates inflight entertainment helps you to not notice the space your seat in economy has to offer on the Boeing 777-300ER.

"Check in at Glasgow was a bit unpleasant, with the counter staff insisting on weighing and tagging hand luggage, which already had an Emirates Skywards Gold Card on it. Every airline has frosty staff. The lounge in Glasgow is pleasant and well presented. The aircraft on the Glasgow to Dubai Leg was modern and in good condition. Inflight entertainment was good with WIFI available. Quality of cabin service was good with a good selection of food and drinks. Flight landed on time with good communication from the cockpit. Transfers in Dubai Airport are pretty simple and painless. Boarding in Dubai for the flight to Addis Ababa was a shambles. For some reason all the staff were rude and looked a bit confused. The aircraft to ADD was awful, a very old Airbus that should have been retired a long time ago. Emirates lost my luggage. They have no local agent in ADD (not sure if thats true but it is what I was told). I then had to find my own luggage, namely travelling out to the airport to try and find my own luggage on subsequent days. The Emirates product you would normally expect in other countries is almost non existent in Addis Ababa. Rude staff, poor Lost baggage processes, very old aircraft.",Passive
"Flew London Gatwick to Melbourne return with Emirates, two segments were on the older Boeing 777 Dubai to Melboune, business class seats 9J aisle, ok - but the service was excellent as was food. Cabin crew introduced themselves at the start of the flight and made sure that you had everything you wanted. The seat on this leg was just an angled lie flat seat, with a foot rest to stop you slipping off the end, and it needed the mattress to make it more comfortable. It was different on the LGW Dubai LGW segments as this was on the A380, seat 9k was extemely comfortable, although the gap to get in was very narrow if you are slighly larger person. Again the service and food was excellent, could not fault it. If I fly to Melbourne again with Emirates will try and make sure its the A380 all the way, just for the comfort.",Promoter
"A380 excellent aircraft. Awful Emirates service. I had high expectations of flying on this aircraft back to London from Dubai. The flight was 3 hours delayed with the only explanation being that there was technical difficulties. Unless you travel by business class or first class you are treated like cattle and hearded on to the plane as such. Once onboard it doesn't get any better in cattle class. Requests for anything, like an extra blanket because it was so cold, are dismissed and you are left wondering if they misunderstood you or just chose to dismiss your request. I chose to fly Emirates only because of the A380 but if I knew the staff were going to be so rude I wouldn't have bothered. Next time I'll read the airline reviews before deciding how to travel. One good point about the aircraft is the Internet access, I can write this review while I'm on the flight.",Detractor

Even the toilet facilities were roomy and well appointed. Staff were courteous and pleasant however myself and my travelling companion (both women in our mid fifties) often were overlooked with some service details while the young male passenger seated on the aisle next to us was always attended to, had meal trays collected (ours were left) and received regular complimentary drinks but we were never asked. A friend (also an older woman) mentioned she had a similar experience travelling business class with Emirates in May 2015 and had to ask the male passenger seated on the aisle next to her to assist with service requests. I've not experienced this with other airlines and maybe this needs to be addressed at the training level.",Promoter
"We were planning a trip to Perth to see our daughter, tragically my wife fell ill, diagnosed terminal within a few days. Just a few weeks later on the day the flight was leaving, after an Emirates flight reminder, she died in just 7 short weeks. During her illness I tried to cancel the flight and use the money to fly my daughter back. Although I thought I had purchased one return ticket with one set of conditions that allowed cancellation, the return flight unknown to me had its own set of conditions that precluded any refund. After many emails and phone calls I was not able to cancel the flight and get a refund. After family help, with no help from Emirates, we got enough money together get my daughter home, tragically too late. During that time Emirates thanked me for my understanding and refused to help quoting terms and conditions of the return ticket and refused to consider changing a ticket to allow my daughter to fly back. They would retain my money and provide no help. During my wife's illness MacMillan Cancer Support contacted Emirates on several occasions and attempted to help get my daughter home using the tickets or a refund on the purchased tickets. The same reply was given to MacMillan Cancer Support as was given to me, despite them talking to senior staff. Emirates final email thanked me for my understanding in these difficult times, saying they could do nothing to help. MacMillan Cancer Support wrote to Emirates to express their concerns over the lack of compassion and support, to-date there has been no reply. If you fly with Emirates pray you will not need their help because they will thank you for your understanding and take your money and leave you alone to sort it out.",Detractor

"Flew Emirates in Business class from Budapest to Shanghai via Dubai. Check in was fast and able to use fast track security. Emirates use the Skycourt lounge in Budapest which is nothing to write home about. Cold food offering, cheap wine and some spirits. Seating was comfortable, but no natural light in the lounge at all. A330 is the Achilles heel of Emirates. I am not sure how they can get away with sending such an uncompetitive aircraft to Budapest. The seats are narrow, recline is limited and are terrible for anything more than a few hours. Food and service was excellent and the staff were very friendly and chatty. Overall, not a bed flight apart from the seats. Used the Emirates lounge in concourse B which is excellent. The food and drinks offerings are outstanding and there are a number of great seating options. The lounge is truly enormous and it would be easy to spend a long time in here. I was actually disappointed when I had to leave. The only complaint was the shower room was extremely hot which made getting dressed very uncomfortable. Second flight on an A380 was excellent. The seat is very comfortable and offers great privacy. Being a night flight, service was limited so as to let people sleep. I put the seat in lie flat mode and slept for the best part of 6 hours. Breakfast was served before arrival in Shanghai and it was once again, very good. On arrival in Shanghai, first and business class have a separate baggage carousel and bags arrived promptly. Emirates provide a great service and connecting in Dubai is flawless. The lounge is really heaven on earth.",Promoter
"Newcastle to Dubai return.The food on board was virtually inedible, and we were offered one drink on a 7.5 hour flight. The staff were unhelpful and if a question was asked or a request made, the look you received was painful. The flight to Dubai was exactly the same. This this was my first time in this region. I felt the people in the UAE were so friendly and helpful and Dubai is spotlessly clean, our only real disappointment was Emirates. The captain announced that there were eleven cabin staff on the plane - what were they doing? One girl was kind and had a smile. She even admitted to us that she didn't and wouldn't eat the meals on board. I had an elderly parent in Business Class and he fared little better apparently. We had approximately forty minutes waiting on luggage, whilst there was no other plane landed at Newcastle competing for resources. This may be an issue with the airport, but worth mentioning as indicative of the poor service we received.",Detractor

The online checkin was smooth and the check in staff at BKK and LHR helpful. Flights were on time and the aircraft was clean and well maintained on all sectors. The ICE system kept me entertained for hours and I noticed they have changed to new square softer headphones. The transit in Dubai was smooth and professionally controlled.

Birmingham to Brisbane via Dubai. I flew Emirates 5 years ago and was very impressed. What a difference this time. The staff were unsmiling and unfriendly to passengers. Meals were slow and on both legs one of the meal options was not available by the time they got to us. On the second occasion I refused the meal offered as I didn't want another stew and I had had enough. I was eventually provided with the meal I wanted but it was put down with ill grace. My partner is vegetarian but he is not vegan. Surely Emirates could provide for both and not treat vegetarians as vegan? His meals were awful and inadequate and he had to have my cheese and biscuits as he was left hungry.,Passive

First leg Lisbon to Dubai on old Boeing 777-300, old ICE and small screen, nice journey because crew were fantastic, very late timing leaving Lisbon, fantastic team in Dubai waiting with signs to take us to the next flight. EK 408 also a Boeing 777-300 to Melbourne with technical stop in Kuala Lumpur. This was a new plane or at least with fantastic seats on the back, great flight. In Melboune waited for EK 406 to take us to Auckland, full flight, don't like so much the A380-800, the seats a bit more space but less privacy like the Boeing 777-300.

"The lure of a stopover in Dubai when flying Orlando to Cape Town was strong. Departed Orlando on the third day after the inaugural flight. In Business Class, Emirates offers limo pick up, which we did. I need a wheelchair, and that went very smoothly to the Business Lounge in Orlando - they were using a very small space, but nice lunch buffet. Seats 9A/B were fairly comfortable as were the other seats we had. Thank goodness for the addition of the long pad for sleeping. Remember the days of Delta being called ""Chicken airline"" because of their chicken meals, then Emirates should be called ""The Reboot airline"". On each of our four segments the computer had to be rebooted because either the ICE did not work, or the partition would not retract or the seat would not go into a flat position. Eventually my daughter had to move to another seat so she could sleep lying down - after all that is what we paid for. Otherwise, I would recommend Emirates to everyone. The service was excellent with only 40 business class passengers on the outward flight to Dubai, and 30 on the return flight. The flight attendants on the Orlando/Dubai segments both ways were so personable and looked after all the passengers. On the Dubai/Capetown segments they were competent, but aloof. One glitch was the wheelchair in Dubai on return trip - was told it was unnecessary as we would be in transit lounge. Not true. And in Orlando the chair was not visible until I finally just sat in the baggage lounge and said I was not going anywhere. We were fortunate to pay $8,000 for the two of us as a special offer.",Promoter

They kept an attentive eye throughout the entire flight and when we asked for some chocolate and they forgot because they were so busy, they went to Business Class and got the chocolate from there.

My seat was 56J/K. and air hostess always skip these seats which is next to kitchen, and they would start from the seat right behind ours.

They are often late these days and I now leave at least a 4 hour gap to make sure I make the next flight in Dubai. For the latest flight from Manila to Dubai they forgot that there is heavy traffic on a Friday night and the crew arrived over 2 hours late - if all the passengers can get to the Airport on time then why can't the crew? What is so bad is that the ground staff lied about the situation when they told the economy passengers the aircraft needed more cleaning, but told the business class passengers the truth. There is no doubt that Emirates is undergoing a decline in service.",Detractor
"I was able to choose my seats for all four sectors on the round trip. I'm not a big man, so economy seating rarely presents me with a problem, and for me the available legroom was fine regardless of aircraft type. The A380 was a cut above the others in terms of comfort and quietness though, but the service was a little wooden and certainly slow, but the food was not bad at all. Service was slightly better on the DXB-SGN return legs, food reasonable but nothing to write home about. One thing I wish Emirates would move away from is the overcrowded serving tray or at least change the shape of it! A square tray balanced on a rectangular seat table is not a great fit. Entertainment was good, except for the Boeing 777 leg (limited choices and poor picture quality), so slept, read, listened to music on that one.

Personally escorted to my Seat 9A by a Vietnamese female flight attendant. I was told I would be looked after by this Cabin attedent throughout my flight and I most certainly was. As I has enjoyed a great breakfast in the Emirates lounge prior to my departure I only had the lite continental breakfast which was pleasant. I have a disability and as my seat was closer to the pointy end of the A380 when I went to use the bathroom I was quietly told I may use the First class facility as First class was empty. Just before landing in Auckland the attendant who had looked after me came and said goodbye then placed a Godiva chocolate with a small hand written note to enjoy my onward travels. Such a personal and special gesture. On arrival a wheelchair awaited me at the aircraft door and 40 min later I was thru customs and on my way to my domestic connection. Thank you Emirates.,Promoter

We arrived at Gatwick at about 10.30am for a 2.25 pm flight to Brisbane via Dubai and we were told there were no flights till 5 pm or tomorrow. We could board the 2.15 pm flight to Dubai. We were told to go to the National Express (bus) counter and get a bus to Heathrow. The bus arrived about 40 minutes later and we arrived at Heathrow at 1pm at the central bus station. It seemed to be about 1 mile walk to the Emirates check in. No trolleys were allowed on the walk : there were several trolley barriers during the walk. When we arrived at the Emirates check in we were not in their system. Emirates at Gatwick had forgotten to re ticket us. We had to go to the Emirates counter to get ticketed and then back to check in. We were then the last people to be seated and we could not sit together. When I boarded I was seated next to an enormous man who sat with his legs apart and his arms spread out invading my seat space. My economy Emirates ticket was AUD $2800 which is very expensive. I'd traveled to France in May 2015 and my ticket was AUD $1700. We only got seating to Dubai and our boarding pass from Dubai to Brisbane was marked as standby even though we were picking up our original flight from Dubai to Brisbane. We had to get seating in Dubai and again we were not able to sit together. Again I was seated next to a very large man. I will never travel with Emirates again.

Most of the passengers were transferring, being after another flight, tired, hungry and thirsty. Many children were on the flight too. Everybody just wanted to have some meal, something to drink as soon as possible and then sleep. But we had to wait for a long time for it to happen.

Usually fly Emirates to Singapore as enjoy that it is an evening flight and you arrive in Singapore just before midnight. Check in was easy and headed straight to the Emirates Lounge. One thing I have noticed with the lounge over the years is that it has not been upgraded and service has been degrading for some time know. Food is average at best and the decor was very ordinary when comparing it to the other lounges. Decided not to upgrade onboard as flight was empty and had a whole row to my self. Flight was comfortable and meals adequate but not the best by far and the crew this time were excellent and flight was on time. I hope in future Emirates upgrades this flight to the A380 as it as a far superior product to the Boeing 777.,Passive

Transiting through Dubai is a nightmare. Overpriced food (desperately needed as so litte food is served on board) and undrinkable coffee, and half hour long queues for the filthy toilets. Toilets onboard the aircraft were not cleaned and as the flight progressed more of them became 'out of order'. In over 20 hours of flying, tea and coffee was served twice. When I asked for a cup of tea I was advised they didn't have any cups. All in all a nightmare trip.",Detractor
"We were looking forward our Emirates experience a lot, since I heard so many things about that company. We flew 4 sectors within 3 weeks with them, and the check-in on all airports used was smooth and didn't take us long even though we were economy passengers. Aircraft were average, typical Boeing 777 but I could manage to get double seat rows on all sectors, so seating was ok. I was surprised that they really put 10 seats across in a row instead of 9 which many airlines do. Cabin crews were in general nice but realizing that there were so many of them compared to other airlines, the performance was just average. The inflight service on all 4 sectors was a joke, once it took exactly 1hr 47mins before the first bar trolley was pushed out of the galley. On all 4 sectors only one meal was served, not even a sandwich before landing which is quite poor in my opinion. Emirates competitor on flights to Dubai does a lot more with less crew. Duty free was just offered via announcement on one sector only and after the service we never saw a bar trolley again. So why does Emirate put so much crew in the cabin if they don't have to work during the flight. I have to say that the tickets were quite cheap but others who paid more probably had the same experience.",Passive
"I found Emirates to be better after an absence of more than 10 years. Professional and courteous staff in BKK, HKG and onboard. Well appointed A380 cabin, good food and service, generous baggage allowance. Last minute changes to my return leg were efficiently handled.",Promoter
"I did 4 flights with Emirates over a 3 week period and on each trip there was issues. Seats and entertainment was fine with no issues. Service and food horrendous. Cabin crew were rude and only thing they where interested in was how quickly they could dish the meals out. Have put a complaint in with Emirates due to a member of staff 'pushing' my fiancÃ© out the way when letting another passanger sit down. On the way home even though sitting next to the cabin crew station, they wouldn't answer the cabin crew service button so I could buy duty free. Also having to listen to the lead cabin crew staff member tell off her staff was a joke. Avoid if you can.",Detractor
"Ground staff at Lisbon we're polite and good natured, but they couldn't for some reason check me for the 2nd leg of my flight from Dubai to Sydney despite trying for sometime, and in the end I told them I'd sort it in Dubai - in hindsight a mistake. The flight was pleasant enough, although as this is Emirates you'll have to endure Arabic subtitles over your movies. I'm not sure why as an international airline they don't offer non subtitled option. Arrived at Dubai and no information about my next flight anywhere. Lined up at Emirates customer service only to be told by a very rude and disinterested customer rep to go to customer service next door and then waved away. Everyone has a bad day so let it go thanked her and went next door. Next customer service rep was the same, told me to catch the train and waved me away. Walked away feeling a little a bit annoyed at Emirates for not being just a little more polite. I then had to cross security twice in queues to finally get to a Qantas desk. Got there to be greeted by a fairly happy and polite rep who handed me my boarding pass with an upgrade to business. Excellent, or so I thought - I spent the next 6 hours waiting for the flight, even made arrangements to take my kids first thing in the morning when I land due to being fresh at the other end. Got to the boarding gate in the lounge, made to wait 15 minutes as the rep was late, to be bumped back down to premium economy by a rude Emirates Rep! Didn't properly click what was going on until I got to the door of the aircraft where I approached the Qantas cabin crew. The first girl was disinterested, non-empathetic and in the end I had to walk away from her. In the end I got to talk to a cabin supervisor and after being questioned by one of his peers (insinuating that maybe I'd made up the story) might not have been the intention but perception is reality especially after only a couple of hours sleep. I was told that 3 people were mistakenly upgraded and that the Lisbon Emirates ground staff shouldn't have upgraded me. I briefly explained that they had nothing to do with it. So I was stuck where I was - I guess you get what you pay for. I was a platinum FF for 5-6 years now I'm just a gold it's amazing how differently you get treated.",Detractor
"This is the second time I flown Emirates Business class to Europe from my home town of Adelaide. The check in was courteous when I asked for my luggage to be tagged as fragile. Boarding was swift. My only complaint at this point in time is the lack of lounge in Adelaide, and we had the share the domestic Qantas lounge which was accessible prior to immigration and custom check. That means that I have very little lounge time. Once boarded the plane, welcome drink was served. Personal introduction by the chief purser of the cabin. Whilst evening meal was offered, we were also offered the option of having breakfast or not being woken up. I chose to have breakfast as it was a long flight of 12 hrs to Dubai. The aircraft departed on time. Hot nuts and a second drink was served prior before the main meal. The options and portions were generous. The food choices were tasty. The seats were comfortable, and better with a soft comforter. The IFE choices were great with latest movies available. There was a separate tablet console which made navigation through their IFE system easier. Time passed very quickly and after breakfast, we soon landed. A good meal and good rest made this overnight travel easier.",Promoter
"My wife and I heard a lot about Emirates: new planes, incredible service and even chauffer ride. We decided to try it on our vacation, as there was a nonstop flight JFK to Milan. The van was on time and the fact that the driver farted did not break our high spirits. It was not too hot and an opened widow saved us. At JFK they did not have a separate line for Business class or Global Access and it took us more time than anticipated to get through. The lounge was calm, clean, fresh air, great selection of food and premium drinks. On board we were greeted with Veuve Clicquot and a selection of juices. My wife asked for different juice and it was produced in seconds. The plane looked new with a lot of gadgets. Stewards were very nice and friendly and were only interested in servicing us even better. We were offered a great selection of premium drinks and very good wines. The dinner meals selection was also good, served hot and delicious like at very good Manhattan restaurant. After dinner the beds were made with mattresses and we had a good rest. In the morning, we had a great breakfast. On exit the chauffer was already waiting and the ride to Milan was very nice. All our expectation were exceeded. On the way back there was a separate line for business class and it took us minuets to get to the lounge, where, again, there was a great selection of tasty food and premium drinks waiting for us. A nice touch: the gate was inside the lounge and it took us few steps to get to our seats. I told my wife that I would rather fly Emirates with a layover in Dubai than a direct to Europe with another airline. On the plane we were greeted with a great selection of orange juice only and when I asked for cranberry, had a beaming smile as an answer and stewardess left. Next time we saw her taking drink orders. I asked what Scotch they had, but she did not know what I meant. I asked for whiskey and she offered John Daniels without alternatives. I decided to try something new and was rewarded with Johnny Walker (I think by taste). Contrary to our first experience, to see a stewardess we had to call and wait for awhile and she always came giving the impression that we drew her away from something important. For dinner we had a selection of two wines: red and white and she did not know what a Wine card was. But she promised that her colleague will come to help me which never happened. I can't say speak to food quality, because she brought somebody else's order and I did not have a chance to get mine. No beds. For breakfast I ordered hot beef sandwich which was served deadly cold. When I asked to warm it - beaming smile and it disappeared, forever. We had the imprudence to check my suit in, shortly before the final descent my wife and I asked for it, five times, but tough luck, I got it when all people were clearing the plane and had to change in the airport bathroom. We were out a bit early and did not find our chauffer at the exit area. We waited for about 30 minutes, until I found the Emirates desk where we were told that my ride is waiting for me outside terminal and around the corner. On the way back we left the highway and stopped as chauffer needed to use the bathroom, which, to be honest, was better than farting. We can take any airline anywhere, but we don't pay a premium for the flight, we pay it for a service. At home my wife asked: ""Emirates again?"" and we laughed.",Detractor
"Very stressful and unhelpful Emirates ground/check-in service overall on my New York to Dubai trip. Chaotic with the limousine service in New York. Really bad reception in Dubai trying to get a hotel voucher and visa through Emirates ground service. Lady at desk gave me a bunch of papers and asked me to go to the bank around the corner, where the papers were stamped. Then I went back to the first point only to be told that there was no need to return I could go through passport control! Maybe tell that, so people do not have to go back/forth. At JFK check in, I asked about an upgrade to first class. ""Sorry, I do not know how to do that!"" was the reply. Maybe ask someone how? After printing boarding cards I asked her again if she could find out about upgrading (Emirates had an upgrade offer for points on the day). She left and came back saying it could not be done - I suspect because she had already given me the boarding cards. Of course it turned out that there were empty first class seats available on the flight. Flights uneventful - but very disappointing overall.",Detractor
"I love the Emirates A380. I have been flying Emirates since 2010, 2 flights per year and I have to say that this is probably one of the most stressful ones as of yet. I was transiting via Dubai with Emirates and we left Doha quite late and had to literally run to our gate. We had to be escorted by ground staff just for us to make our next flight. I got to the gate and I was probably one of the last few to get on, which was a relief. I go on really short 5-day holidays and my schedule is pretty lean. Not making it to a flight will probably ruin my itinerary a whole lot. Anyway, when I got to the plane, it was quite hectic. DXB-HKG is always mad, I've been flying this route regularly for the past couple of years and it's pretty busy. The staff was not as courteous as before. Seats are standard, but mine would not recline. Not sure if the seat was faulty or the passenger behind me just had really long legs. I have to comment on how the cabin crew looked really exhausted and worn out and we had not even left yet! Uniforms all wrinkled and presence was just sending out vibes of tiredness.",Passive
"Emirates has a super F-class product. The driver takes you from home to the airport. Check in easy and efficient and you can go to the Emirates lounge in Manchester and a superb one in Dubai. The lounge in Cape town has a fantastic shower but lounge is overcrowded sadly. A380 between Manchester and Dubai is fantastic, an excellent suite with privacy doors. The food is served whenever you want it, whether you want a full meal, snack or a combination. The food is very good, the Meze and caviar were highlights for me. The bar at the back of business is fun. They even bring 2004 Dom to drink. The wine is some of the best in the world, including a sumptious St Emillion. Fun on the A380 is the shower, a proper glass-doored cabinet. You are allowed 5 mins of water, you can switch it off between bursts. The shower room has a heated floor which is magnificent. Afterwards they offer fresh tea and fruit, all very civilised! The crew on all the flights were brilliant, though the crew on the way home from Dubai to Manchester just edged it! They were so friendly and helpful. The Boeing 777 from Dubai to Cape Town is a less glamorous aircraft but the service and comfort was top notch. I think this is the most relaxing way to travel.",Promoter
"We expected a lot from Emirates, but were unfortunately a little disappointed on our flight from Bangkok to Venice via Dubai. The crew on the plane was quite unorganised. The meals were mixed up. We ordered two children's menus and two special meals and we were lucky enough our meals were not mixed, but our neighbors did not get the special meals they ordered. The staff apologised, however this is not what you would expect from Emirates. Other children on the flight got the toys, but they forgot our children (both 5 years old) and they were very disappointed. Afterwards we had to ask stewardess to please give them something - so later they received the entertainment set. We were quite disappointed with crew services. The entertainment system was excellent, the variety of movies, music you could choose. Wi-Fi was payable.",Passive
"Customer service is really lacking on Emirates. The food in the main cabin was awful, dry and tasteless. The stewards are not very courteous either leaving another bad taste in your mouth. On the flight to Bangkok, I tried to purchase two duty free items but was denied when I produced my driver's license and credit card. According to the steward he could not sell the item to me unless I signed my card. I told him that for safety reasons I do not sign the card and this is a very antiquated rule since the cards now carry a chip. The 3 stewards made quite a scene because I refused to sign my card. After a while I simply asked them to leave me alone and reminded them that this is not a necessity. They all left mumbling to each other. On my return flight from BKK I showed up at the airport with 2 pieces of checked baggage. The staff at the counter told me I was only entitled to one bag and I would have to pay for the other. Of course I said no problem expecting a reasonable price. To my surprise the representative quoted me over 22,000 BHT for the bag. I told her I was only checking an extra bag and not an extra person. She explained that according to my ticket, I have to pay by the kilo per bag. Still in shock, I asked to talk to the manager who was not in any way helpful.",Passive

"When I first travelled Emirates over 5 years ago I could not sing their praises enough. However I have just returned from Munich having one of the worst experiences ever. After moving seats because my entertainment screen did not work, I was seated in one of the two remaining empty seats. I was seated in 48J between two obese travellers and a young woman. As the obese lady needed 1.25 seats it was 12 hours of hell. The food trays were left for an hour which made it impossible to go to the bathroom or move around. Window shades were left open when it was sleep time, when I asked an attendant to request it to be closed I was informed ""sorry the man is asleep"". If a plane is going to be 100% full may I suggest they put on the amount of staff required to service the customers. On the first leg of my journey it was 45 mins before I got a glass of water, I rang the bell but no one replied. I was next to the window and man next to me had all his computer gear (large laptop) because his entertainment system did not work. At the last leg of my journey waiting to use the bathroom for a good ten minutes it was opened by an attendant, who removed the garbage bags so I could use it. Waste was overflowing in the restrooms. The worst was being locked into my seat by food trays, left for what seemed forever. The last experience I had like this was with a Quantas flight to Hong Kong, at least they apologised and explained that they were on staff member down. When are airlines going to realise that economy flyers are their bread and butter and we have a voice. I would rather pay another 15% and be treated as a guest and not an inconvenience.",Detractor
"London Heathrow to Guangzhou via Dubai return on Emirates. London to Dubai on an A380 plane quite full, food was reasonable but trays are now smaller so portions smaller. Cabin crew went through the motions, efficient but strange that drinks followed meal and not served before or with any haste. Dubai to Guangzhou on a Boeing 777 - plane virtually full, seat comfort not as good, seats narrow and 3x4x3 layout. Cabin crew efficient but hardly a smile. Flight on time, but beware of Guangzhou airport, it's very slow to get through, large queues. Inbound from Guangzhou to Dubai 5 days later on Boeing 777, an older aircraft, again very full. Similar hard narrow seat, cabin crew seemed more interested in preening hair and chatting to each other than dealing with passengers. Food quite good, a better menu. Dubai to London on the A380 - on time, cabin crew served a continental breakfast that was very small and unappetising. Lunch followed later - on the menu it looked good, but it was quite poor.",Passive
"I recently flew Emirates from Gatwick to Johannesburg via Dubai return, outward in economy and return in business. The difference is remarkable, in that their economy product is actually much better than business, notwithstanding the extra legroom, flat bed etc. The business product food has become unbearably overcomplicated and plain, and more familiar dishes would be much better. Its almost impossible from the menu descriptions to imagine what you will end up with. The age old problem of Emirates running out of preferred choice continues to be endemic to both classes. Wash bags have been axed on day flights in business class, magazines reduced considerably and the DXB lounge shabby (albeit work is ongoing). Queues for the toilets in the lounge are the norm and poor signposting leaves 10s of travelers lost in a daze. Service standards and crew standards are excellent as is the bottom line standard for Emirates but I can't help thinking that with a bit more focus on the business side, they could be back to where they should be - an industry benchmark.",Passive
"Bangkok to Birmingham via Dubai with Emirates. I have been using Emirates for the past 10 years and the service has gone downhill. The positives are a great entertainment system, good prices if the flight is booked at the right time but that's about it. Nowadays the meals have been scaled down and they must be using a cheap supplier as they have gone downhill on the culinary front - none of the meals that I have had over the past couple of years have been very nice, especially when you compare the economy cabin food of Singapore and Malaysia Airlines both of whom were excellent. I also find that it depends on the crew if you get attention on your flight - on this flight both legs the crews were not at all interested in the passengers, no water runs were made, you had to ring continuously for drinks and then you were served by a surly crew.",Detractor
"Dubai to Melbourne via Kuala Lumpur with Emirates, and we were pleasantly surprised. The seats (20F/G) were narrow but had decent legroom. Neither of us are tall, but we could have readers and glass cases in the seat pocket and not be bothered. The entertainment system is great : lots of choice and I do like watching the forward looking camera on take-off and landing. The food was good too. Problems are that seats are very narrow, so bumped the neighbour when eating, the food tray is huge - everything comes at the same time, so there is no room on the tray table for wine bottle or discarded containers. Coffee cups are poorly designed, any turbulence and it sloshes out. But overall, for economy, a not so bad experience.",Promoter
"A380 business class seat, IFE and onboard bar are still excellent, chauffeur service and Dubai lounges are top-notch. However, the food is quite average with menus remaining the same for several months on some routes. Also, the quality of the cabin staff service be very different from one flight to another. A good choice if seat and IFE are what matters for you.",Promoter
"Once more some serious differences between these two Emirates flights. From Osaka to Dubai, with a 23:40 departure, dinner was served at 01:30. An old plane, not really a flat seat. Poor drinks and poor food. From Dubai to Geneva, everything was quicker and smoother, nice drinks, food, and a pleasant crew, including a great FA from Ile Maurice. Once more, there is a feeling that there is a second class Business Class on Emirates. Note that ""free"" wi-fi is 10MB, and after 15 mn, you start being charged.",Passive
"I was excited to be flying Emirates A380 business class for the first time. Chauffeur service top notch. Seats well-designed, but the film choice was poor. The onboard service was appalling. The problem being that there are so many people in business class in the upper deck of the 380 that the logistics of meal and drinks service go up the creek. Added to which the stewards/stewardesses act like automatons with no common sense and often poor or no English. One example of cock-eyed service is that my wife and I were sitting next to each other but service came from different aisles so she might be waiting patiently for her soup while I am waiting (less patiently) for my pudding. And her wine steward wasn't permitted to fill up my glass and my aisle wine dispenser appeared 40 minutes later. Seemingly the only way to beat the system is to go to the bar at the back of the section but that would have requires all sorts of seat contortions. On a 7 hour evening flight you expect to get some decent sleep but there isn't enough sleep time when the airline's gambit is to stretch out drinks and dinner unendingly. Not a success for the airline which is sad. Will not go Emirates again, certainly not on the evening flight.",Detractor

"Flight from Adelaide to Dubai on 16 August would have to be one of the worst flights I have taken. The cabin crew were disinterested and disorganised. Seats are very uncomfortable and leg room is almost non existent. The food was the worst food I have encountered on an airline. They did asked if you would like a drink, but you would have to ask exactly what was on offer as no more information was forthcoming. The worst part was the lack of water being offered on board. They came around twice to offer a cup of water and I found that I became very dehydrated. Even though there is a water cooler near the toilets (which I didn't know about at the time) it was almost impossible to get out of my seat as I was in the middle and my companion was asleep. One good thing was the ICE entertainment system. Lots of movies etc, which helped get through this flight.",Passive
"Due to non functioning baggage conveyer belt, the departure from Dammam was delayed, resulting in missing A380 connecting flight to Barcelona. Emirates put me in a hotel to wait for the next flight. Next flight was on new Boeing 777-300ER, the IFE screen is sharp, hi-res picture quality, thin and light. I was allocated a seat 24H which is an exit row seat, better legroom. I think a way of saying sorry for the misconnection that I had. IFE system is the best, food is generous. I'd rather less food but better quality. Avoid using Tourico Holidays, a company associated with Emirates, they cancelled my hotel reservation without even notifying me. The first cancellation, I was told to enter my physical address to avoid cancellation. I rebooked thru them the second time with physical address. Arriving in Barcelona hotel, shocked to be told that the hotel reservation is cancelled again, although my credit card was charged (apparently refunded), but no email to notify me that it has been cancelled by tourico. Nasty company. If you want to be stranded in a foreign city without any accommodation. Please do your booking with Tourico. You would see this company, if you purchase your ticket on Emirates website. A company such as Emirates should not associate themselves with this shoddy company. Avoid Tourico.",Passive
"I flew Emirates on EK11 from Dubai to London Gatwick on a full Boeing 777-300. The flight departed on time and after take off, drinks and a small snack was served before lights were turned off. The seat back TV had lots of films and TV shows to watch. About 2.5 hours prior to landing a hot full breakfast was served. The 10 across seating makes the aisles very narrow, a few airlines using this plane still have 9 seats across. Cabin staff did their job but lacked smiles and any form of friendliness. Overhead bins are meant for hand luggage so why do EK allow passengers to board with excessive cabin baggage? I saw one passenger with a small wheelie suitcase, two bags of duty free, a backpack and large handbag and she used up two overhead bins. I saw other passengers with similar amounts of hand luggage which is a bit unfair to other passengers. The passenger seated next to me was one of the last to board and had nowhere to put his hand luggage. The cabin crew told him to put it under the seat in front of him, so he had no leg room for the entire 7 hour flight.",Passive
"Emirates are getting worse. My latest flight started in Beirut. Check-in was horrible, four different lines of people, no one knew which line is what. Business/First class and economy ticket holders were lining up in the same lines. The check-in staff was shouting instructions and people in the back could not hear a word. The flight took off almost 45 minutes late, the crew was professional and very pleasant, but that is the only thing positive to say about the whole trip. We landed in Dubai far away from the terminal. Emirates is running out of terminals and gates, so they land their planes some where in the massive DXB airport and then herd you in a bus. We actually got stuck inside the plane for another 20 minutes before disembarking to a bus. The bus trip to the terminal took another 25 minutes with frequent stops all over the airport. By the time the bus reached the terminal, everyone was cursing the airline. Come on Emirates, you were much better than this. What is happening?",Detractor

WiFi on board for free (limited amount, enough for some WhatsApp coversations) and the meals are great.",Promoter
"I really want to like Emirates, the whole concept of their strategy is excellent but the execution is another story. The product on 2 flights with 2 very different stories. Check in at HKG was simple, fast and friendly. The A380 was a nice plane with kind and helpful staff. Comfortable plane with decent food out of Hong Kong and kind crew. Only gripe is that I had to wait 30 mins from being served my dinner to then waiting for the drinks trolley on our side - the result left me wanting to eat with wine but in the end had a cold meal with wine, but the wine selection in Economy is pretty good. Flight on a Boeing 777-300 from Dubai to Gatwick was not so nice, weird food as the flight was early morning, and a crew like they could not be bothered excepting one Korean staff. Asking for an eyeshade as the flight departed at 02:30 from 2 crew members got me okay I will get one, to we don't carry them but I will look - in the end no come came to help or answer and I had no eyeshade. The Boeing 777 was not comfortable, not as bad as I was expecting but a far cry from Korean Air 777-300 I flew a few weeks earlier. The mileage points, after London to Seoul and Hong Kong to London, all I earned was 4400 air points! And the endless annoying pointless announcements in at least 2 languages but more if you are flying to a country with a differing language. I also found it quite arrogant how when you watch the flight map you must listen to the ramblings from the CEO on how amazing they are and the merits of the Emirates Ideals. Connecting in Dubai can add a lot of time to your trip, in this case about 5 hours compared with direct. I will try to go with Qatar Airways or Korean Air as a first choice, but not that Emirates will care as their flights are always full.",Passive
"I changed my Emirates flight to a late flight departing Athens at 22.20 and arriving into Dubai at 03.50, because there was First Class offered on this extra service and according to my reservation the aircraft was a Boeing 777LR with closed suites. The morning of my departure I was disappointed to find that the aircraft had been changed to an A330 with only sleeper seats. I have never traveled on an Emirates A330, so I had no idea what the seats would be like. On boarding the aircraft I was horrified to find that the seats were not even angle lie flat seats, in fact the seats could hardly recline more than a business class seat on a domestic route. Whilst I understand that airlines can and do change aircraft types on a route, how Emirates could change from private suites to a seat with limited recline and very small leg rest on an overnight services is beyond what I expect when paying a First Class fare. On top of that whilst there was many empty gates on arrival at DXB we were places on a stand far away from the terminal. Again another sign that Emirates have no consideration for the comfort of their passengers.",Detractor
"Amsterdam-Dubai-Bangkok with Emirates. A380 airplanes are impressive, although the services at both the airport and onboard flights leave room for improvement.

Got a call in the morning from skyward desk informing of delay. Shared Lounge at CPH not bad but crowded. Cabin crew good but not excellent. After arriving into DXB 2 hrs late, was taken to remote stand which was at far end of airport. Thereafter a much dreaded 20-30 minute bus journey to terminal. This felt like we were driving back to CPH. Baggage was already there before us. Dubai to Melbourne left on time, which is rare with heavy traffic out of DXB during morning rush time. Service onboard again not bad. Newer A380 aircraft with better IFE, but food was terrible. Early arrival into MEL and was out in 20 minutes of landing.",Passive

Food was lovely, I am a big fan of Middle Eastern food and it is suitable for most Western palates. The in-flight entertainment system is miles better than British Airways, who I flew last time. The channel Relax TV was a nice new addition which I don't think they had last time. The screens aren't great in daylight (they never are), but they are fine at night.

IFE is excellent as always. Food is another story and is pretty bad now. A far cry from what is said in menu. The second leg the Purser was rude and made impression he would rather be somewhere else. All this said, Emirates is not bad and does fly out to many places and with seamless connections via DXB.",Passive

However I found that many lavatories had waste or even used papers and garbage on the floors and the flight attendants failed to clean it.",Promoter
"Flew Emirates from Houston to Dubai. I enjoyed the service and found the food tasted very good and was of high quality. The seats were fairly comfortable and the entertainment system was better than any other airline I have flown so far. One thing I did not like was that most lavatories I went to had toilet paper on the floor and trash in the bathroom, flight attendants had failed to clean the restrooms.",Promoter
"Disgusting service with Emirates. I am a rewards member and my flights were terrible. Being bumped from our reserved seats on both our return trips, even though my seats were confirmed. I complained on my first two flights and they assured me that my return flights were safe. Well they weren't. They bumped us again. I am disgusted at the Emirates attitude. I won't fly with them again. Choose a different carrier you will save yourself some grief.",Detractor
"Out of Budapest and Warsaw Emirates have very old A330-200 planes which should have been retired years ago. In business class the AV system is old and the seats are not lie-flat and quite uncomfortable. I'm 6ft 2ins tall and my feet don't rest on the ground when I'm sitting in the seat. It's quite tough to sleep in these seats. In Dubai Emirates park the aircraft for these routes at the outer reaches of the airport, so a 20-25 minute bus ride from the terminal to the plane is normal when arriving and departing from Dubai. The last time I travelled they loaded the business class passengers on the bus after all the economy passengers had left. The ground staff then left us sitting with open doors in the bus terminal for about 15 minutes next to three other buses, all of which had their engines running while they waited for the last business passengers to arrive. Despite all of this, the onboard staff are lovely, and on this route they have apologised about the plane. Emirates seems to be operating a penny pinching service to Central Europe but advertising it on the basis that it's the same standard as the rest of the network. Overall if you can get a budget price for this route then it it may be worthwhile, but if you can avoid paying a premium to fly on these Emirates routes as you will be disappointed.",Detractor
"Cape Town to Manchester via Dubai in Emirates economy class. On time and great in-flight service. Enterainment system also one of the best. No issue with check in - all handled smoothly and good boarding at Cape Town. As others have said the Boeing 777 has narrower seats and aisles - not a problem for me, but does reduce the quality of the flight for some. Food, I ordered special meals which came as requested and okay. In Dubai had to be transferred to and from the planes by bus which lengthens the transfer time. The airport has been built to take more people but seems to be bursting at the seams. Allow plenty of time if you are having to go on the train to and from terminals - it can be time consuming with lots of lifts, walks and then the train trip itself. Easy deplaning in Manchester and immigration and baggage claim there efficient.",Passive
"Flew Emirates London Gatwick to Cape Town via Dubai. Good check in, good fast track and lounge. Boarding yet again a mess. Complaint to purser. Suite 1K, well trained on board staff and excellent purser. Food and drinks so so. Problem was family of 2 with 6 kids were running around and making a lot of noise. I'm not sure IATA allows these number of minor/children in such a small cabin. Talked to the purser who then talked to the father and things were a little better for a while. Could not sleep. Connecting in Dubai was a mess like the many other times I have transited there. Premium membership and fast track with this airline makes no difference at all, priority wise. Transit is a mess, problems with trains between terminals made us walk forever. A real unfortunate laugh. Second leg, with an 11 month old baby on board in the same cabin was crying non stop for 9 hours. The whole experience was a mess. Cabin staff apologetic but of no good to me. Bag on time but what two vile legs in first class.",Detractor
"I flew Emirates Johannesburg to Dubai, and guess the flight comfort depends on the type of aircraft and how many passengers are onboard. In my case I was quite lucky. No queues at the airport, security, immigration and check-in went very fast. Onboard there was enough legroom space, large interactive screen with an amazing selection of entertainment and movies. Internet WI-FI on board 500 MB for just 1$, decent meal. I was on an aisle and no one was sitting next to me and this added some comfort of course. Staff was courteous and prompt. I have to say that for an eight hours flight in Economy class this one wasn't bad at all, I'd say excellent actually.",Promoter
"Sydney to Christchurch with Emirates, which was a codeshare flight with Qantas. Flight delayed by 2.5 hours due to late arrival from Bangkok so instead of departing at 9.25am, it wasn't until after midday. However, made up time in the air arriving at 4pm. Once in the air, service was excellent. Seated in 21K, in the last row of the front economy section, up against a toilet. Toilet was no bother though. With headphones, you hear nothing, and no smells. 3x4x3 seating with good pitch. Seat recline was great and I had no issues with reclining as no one behind. Good selection of entertainment options. Warm moist hand towels given upon departure. Menu with two choices. Food plentiful for this 2.5 hour flight. Flight was not full. Many seats spare. Seat beside me was free as it was for many seated on outside rows. Arrival into Christchurch was at a time when Emirates is the only international flight. So processing fast. Bags on belt within ten minutes of disembarking. From landing to airport exit was 15 minutes. Really good. Christchurch Airport is the best international airport in New Zealand. Apart from delay, it was a great flight.",Promoter

Arrived Dubai airspace around 1900 hrs hours next day, but told to fly around for 30 minutes due to heavy traffice.

I boarded at 8am for this 2 hour flight, and when meal was served I was surprised to see a combo meal of curry, potato bhajee, cutlet, bread with jam and butter. This was like a lunch deal rather than breakfast. When I asked for the breakfast the staff replied they had only one type of meal. I can't understand why they served lunch instead of breakfast on such a quite early morning flight.",Passive

They still failed to issue boarding passes for both legs. We had to pick up Dubai-Dhaka boarding passes at Dubai.

Cabin crew were friendly. Even though flying economy I was addressed by my name. The cabin was in good condition, space and legroom were good. The only thing I can criticize was that entertainment system was not functioning properly on one of the flights, but I slept most of the time and it didn't matter. It is a mystery why Emirates is not rated with 5 stars.",Promoter
"Poor service with miserable staff. Very poor individual monitor reception (films kept sticking). Very stingy with the drinks trolley (soft drinks too). No snacks were given out.

"I first traveled with Emirates in March 2015 with my 10 year old son to Dubai. The Business Class service was appalling. The crew strutted around, barely taking orders and being completely inept. They served my son the wrong meal and did nothing to make him feel comfortable. They ended up losing my luggage on arrival, such that I was left with no clothes for the first 24 hours. I decided to give them a second chance and this time all 4 of us, (including my 10 year old and 5 year old), flew from NYC to Dubai and on to Bombay in mid August returning 3 days ago. Once again, the service on board was completely disorganized. On boarding, my 5 year old son's seatbelt had dried food all over it. I asked the steward to clean it and he handed me a warm towel and told me to do it myself. When I asked for my dessert to be given to my 5 year old instead of listening to me the stewardess said, ""You only get oreo cookies as dessert with a child's ""economy"" meal"". First off, I had paid $4000 per ticket for our Business Class tickets so the concept of ""child's economy meal"" didn't arise. I will never fly them again.",Detractor
"It's such a shame for the incompetence of their ground staff in johannesburg. I've never seen such shambles in my life. We were flying with our two 8 month old twins and 10 year old son. When we got to Johannesburg airport we already done online check in so just went to check out bags in. We waited right in front of the queue for a half hour because staff didn't know what they were doing then finally we got helped, it took the women another half hour to just check our bags in then she got all worried then told us she made a massive mistake, she put the previous passengers name tags on our bags so she had to change all the name tags. However, 2 bags were already sent down so she said she will go and change those tags. We quickly went to say goodbye to family and rushed through because we were running late due to the bag situation. While standing in the queue for ages at passport control one of the staff came and shouted at us because we holding the flight up I explained to her it was due to their incompetence we were late not ours - she rudely rushed us to the gate and saying one of our bags is at suspicious bags because there's a toy gun or aerosol can in it - neither of those items in it. When we got to the gate 15 mins before departure we were rudely spoken to by the other staff saying that we were kicked off. One of the staff members walked us to get our bags and out of departures lounge to rebook our flight. Then they realise that they put our tags on someone else's bags so two of our bags was missing, and other passengers wouldn't have their bags either. After 3 hrs of trying to locate our bags they finally decided that they think that our bags were on the flight to London. When rebooking our flight for the next day, they wanted to charge us an extra Â£500 per adult even though it was their fault we missed our flight. After speaking to the supervisor she said the only thing she can do to help us is only charging us a no show fee that was still Â£160. The next day got to the airport they said they've got us on the stand by 13:50 flight to Dubai so we will have 9 hrs transit in Dubai. When we got to Dubai we had to get our boarding passes for the next flight only to realise then that the staff at Johannesburg decided not to book our 2 infants on the next flight - luckily the staff at Dubai was helpful and helped us to book them on to the flight. The last straw was when our pushchair went missing due to Johannesburg staff incompetence again.",Passive
"Very comfortable seats, particularly on the Dublin - Dubai B777-300ER leg (the seats had a built-in massage function). Loved the bar on the Dubai-Melbourne A380 leg. Catering was better from Dubai-Melbourne, some of the meal selections did not translate to tasty meals on the first leg. Staff on both legs were exceptional, very friendly, courteous and nothing was too much of a problem for them. The lounge facilities in Dublin could be improved, however the lounge in Dubai was wonderful. The chauffer service was a nice touch and took the hassle out of getting home from Melbourne Airport. The only other criticism beyond the food (which is a small one) is that the flight display didn't work on the Dubai - Melbourne leg. Would highly recommend business class with this airline.",Promoter

I really want to like Emirates so much but the variable nature of their service just makes the love difficult to give. It's the whole experience from check in at Sydney (the agent was very grumpy about my baggage being 4kgs over and did not like being told that as a Qantas FF I was well within my allowance) to onboard where the crew were nice but just lacked polish. It's a case of Emirates having expanded so swiftly that their staffing standards are haphazard. Small things such as bags with linen from the crew rest area being dumped at the back of the main deck - Just not a good look. Emirates fly from Sydney to where I need to get to globally but just make it difficult to love them.,Passive
"We left Heathrow at 10.15pm, due to arrive in Dubai around 8am, so this is an overnight flight as I see it. So I didn't understand the logic of serving us a full dinner an hour into the flight and then breakfast 2 hours before landing. The cabin lights only went off for about an hour between these times, so overall it was almost impossible to sleep. When we checked in online we (couple with toddler son) were not given 3 seats together but the staff on the ground at LHR managed to talk someone into moving so we ended up together. Service on board was okay, but not up to the standards I have experienced in the past. Overall though, I cannot recommend this airline and flight for this route - if you are staying in Dubai you have had no chance to sleep and therefore you are going to have to manage 2 days awake in a row and probably not have a chance to enjoy your day in Dubai.",Detractor
"Boarding was fine but we were standing around with no info given as to why we weren't moving. Left 20 odd minutes late but flight time to Melbourne was an hour short so that was good. Emirates is a really good airline for flying with children. But overall I was underwhelmed with the service - indeed it seems to be getting worse each time I fly this airline. Food delivery is a bit erratic in terms of timing, and the steward serving hot drinks passed us by twice. Going to Auckland it was announced we were descending. We hadn't received NZ arrival cards, which are rather long to fill out, so I asked a passing steward. He seemed surprised by the request and I pointed out that everyone else would need one too. So a few minutes later he came round with some - but nowhere near enough for everyone so he had to go back and get some more. Then they got grumpy with us for having a tray table down (to fill it out) while we were in descent. This was really poor - surely handing out landing cards is a pretty basic function - they were handed out straight away going to Melbourne. We had breakfast twice - just before landing in Melbourne and again after taking off and it was pretty much the same both times. Bad luck if you don't like mushrooms or baked beans. Overall disappointing and, if going to Europe again, I will look for other options.",Detractor
Flown Emirates from Gatwick LGW To Brisbane BNE via Dubai DXB. Seats was comfortable but the inflight entertainment was excellent. Cabin crews always smiled and food was ok. I would fly with them again.,Promoter
"London Heathrow to DXB in Business Class on the A380. If business class was purely about the comfort of seating and the layout I would give Emirates 10/10. However, I witnessed a very different picture then to my expectations. Having flown Qatar airways throughout the years even on a Bahrain to Dubai flight via Doha, I was accustomed to high standards of service. The service from the crew was a letdown. I asked for a fruit platter and I was told by the crew that they would have to check whether they even have it available. I mean ridiculous that you would not have this to be served to a passenger twice. Frustrating was the fact that the crew did not even come back to tell me through out the whole flight that they did not have fruit plate available, which I think he assumed I forgot. Each and every time I requested something I had to typically wait longer then a passenger flying economy. I even did not garner a response from the crew that they were unable to carter to my request or an apology for the same. The food itself was not up to the exquisite taste we come to associate with this travel. Obviously I would not know better because I was not able to try another statement dish. I have had better, personal and quicker service in A380 economy where a crew is bound to serve more then 300-400 passengers. I do think I would appreciate a more personal response and attention then a standard we are sorry to hear of your inconvenience and regret the same. I am not going to risk that next trip unless I actually see an effort on part of the airline to make amends for its lackluster performance.",Passive

I had a car seat with me, so that I can seat with some comfort. None of the crew members in the economy class knew how to fit the car seat in the airline seat.

Nice boarding, brand new aircraft, clean and beautiful seats. Food inedible (beef). Robotic service. But excellent drinks (Veuve Clicquot, great Bordeaux). Late on landing as usual in Dubai. Lounge in T3/B is ugly, but food was ok. Showers too small, much smaller than at T3/A. Boarding to KIX completely chaotic. Very old aircraft, worn-out seats, but excellent food and a fantastic crew, smiling FA, always ready to help. Very unusual on Emirates. Poor drinks however.",Passive

"The Check In at Heathrow was entirely disorganised. We were on EK6 and at 7pm when arrived at check in there was an overlap of EK4 passengers in one queue and the rest in a separate queue leading to the main queue. There was no organisation to know who was on which flight and which of the many queues to send them to. After taking 1 hour to check in we finally finished. The Aircraft was fine, relatively new and everything worked well with a friendly crew. However the flight to Colombo via MalÃ© was on a 777-300 (NON ER) which was very tired and featured the old ptv screens which were half broken. Also many passengers had the same seats on their tickets which was extremely puzzling for everyone as they were all re-arranged.

"I flew Emirates to Zurich (ZRH) via Dubai (DXB) on 11 June 2015. Even though my IFE system was not working, the cabin service was impressive. I arrived at the gate pretty early before boarding, approximately 1 hour before gate opens, the aircraft arrived from Melbourne on time. As theres nothing much to shop or dine, I decided just to wait at the gate and talk to the EK crews. (The aircraft layover in SIN was 1.5 hours before continuing to Dubai). The crews were friendly and I felt welcomed for the journey. We took off 18 mins later than schedule. It was a 7 hour night flight. When we flew over India, it got a bit bumpy but the cabin crews frequently came and checked on me and offered drinks and light snacks. We touched down at Dubai International airport 19 mins earlier than schedule.",Promoter
Our flight from Bangkok to Dubai was on the newer A380 and was half empty in Business class. The seat is very comfortable and the crew provided us with a mattress to make it even better for sleeping. There is plenty of storage and the bar next to the seat is a nice touch. The main bar at the back of the upper floor is great idea for socializing. Flight from Dubai to LHR was on the older A380 and it was showing its age. The seat was not as nice and quite dirty in some parts. The crew were friendly and selection of drinks was great. I am vegetarian and I was struggling to find anything on the menu. I ended up having just a starter and dessert. They were both tasty but I am surprised that they did not offer any main meals without meat.,Promoter
"I have flown with Emirate a number of times over the last few years, the latest being in April 2015. In many ways they are a good airline, but for vegetarians they are absolutely appalling. Despite always ticking the box for vegetarian lactose (ie. including dairy products) I am only ever served vegan food. This is extremely unsatisfactory because I am not a vegan. At breakfast time when everyone else is eating a nice cheese omelette with hash browns and mushrooms, I am given some horrendous dish of tasteless potatoes. I am absolutely fed up with the dreadful food served to vegetarians on every Emirates flight I have flown. I am dreading my next flight with them in December.",Detractor
"The cabin on the new Airbus is lovely. Comfortable bar and lounge area, excellent seats with your own personal mini-bar. On these facilities I have no complaints. My disappointment on my four flights were customer service or the lack thereof, and I am afraid the ultimate criticism - it was no different to being in Economy. On each flight amenity bags were quickly distributed to men, despite waiting patiently I always had to ask. On an 8 hour evening flight I was told, ""we don't hand these out on evening flights."" The menu invites you to choose what tea or coffee you would like. But in reality there is no choice, just like in Economy two stewards come around with flasks of tea and coffee. Tray table is pulled out on the hour, breakfast arrives 20 mins later, coffee follows after 10 mins, and the refill never came. Within the cabin depending on which side your seat was on you visibly had a different experience. I could see post take off drinks being served, but I was never offered one. It becomes tiring to keep buzzing them to receive a minimum service. I have often mocked the likes of Virgin for their automated approach to customer service - but at least you all receive the same service, it is not the luck of the draw. They are inefficient, unorganised, rude, and left me in no doubt that I will never travel Emirates Business Class again.",Detractor
"Emirates is not your ordinary airline, in that it has one of the most extravagantly decorated cabins, from the LED stars to the fancy bathrooms to how their IFE works. It's also worth noting that they seem to fly the plane at maximum operating speeds at all times. It's a nice thought that we matter more than fuel savings. Food was great, seats weren't superb, and cabin service was satisfactory. Being a frequent flyer on Cathay Pacific, I can say that they provide far better service in terms of the cabin crew and frequency of meals. IFE had a very wide suggestion, and worked very smoothly, it's nice of them to leave a volume setting button on the remote even when announcements are being made. Unfortunately Emirates really falls short on seat comfort. I love the 777, it's great, but a 3-4-3 seat configuration is not. The seats felt narrow and sort of claustrophobic. I still hate the layovers though.",Promoter
"After the long awaited flight to Paris from Sydney we settled in to our flight which included our two girls 5 and 8. The first flight was an early morning flight out of Sydney and it soon became apparent I was going to be let down. The new A380 is not so new anymore, the seats didn't work properly, the plane as a whole looked tied. The food, well for us it was just ok apart from the frozen salad but the kids food, awful. Absolutely terrible. Now I'm not suggesting for a moment my kids aren't picky when it comes to food, but this was terrible. Pasta that was cooked days ago and reheated. Well they tried to reheat. It was either was frozen or cold. The bread was also terrible. The cabin crew on the first leg were great and up to Paris also great but on the flight home from Dubai to Sydney. They weren't interested. They basically bitched how tied they were for the entire trip. I'm back in London in October, flying Etihad, lets hope for a better experience.",Detractor

Customer service staff poor in Kuala Lumper, one senior member of staff even answered his mobile whilst talking to us without apologising.

The only thing that impressed me was the limited Wifi connection we had, but won't be long before other flight operators offer this service.",Detractor

"Overall we found flying with Emirates a very pleasant experience. LGW to Dubai was on Airbus A380 - comfortable seats (although the IFE wasn't working on my seat which was disappointing and it wasn't rectified by crew even though I asked them twice). Food quality was good and generous. Transit at Dubai was a bit long winded having to change terminals but fine as it was a short transfer time. Dubai to Male was very comfortable - service was marginally better on this leg. Return journey, Male to Dubai again on B777 (which was noisy) but again comfortable with good service. Breakfast was good in terms of quality. Dubai to LGW - transit was ok, although the boarding gate was too small for the number of passengers - no where to sit. Flight was pleasant with very good service, comfortable seats, quiet aircraft, IFE and good quality meals. Overall - better aircraft, service and value for money than European carriers. Only downside was transit at Dubai which is a bit of trek.",Promoter
"I flew Emirates for my first time recently. Having read reviews talking about how great they are and reviews about how cramped their 777 is, I was sceptical. My flight was quite cheap to book ($~650USD). Be warned however, that if you are not flying to or from the US, luggage rules are stricter. If you fly to/from the US, you receive 2 x 20kg bags, otherwise, it is 30kg total. This forced me to spend $350USD on an extra 5kg of luggage, which was quite a hassle. Despite the availability of business class seats, you can only upgrade with points, not cash. The flight was fine, the flight attendants are very sweet and helpful, and the food was some of the best I've had. However - food and drink service takes at least an hour to be delivered, leaving many people finishing their meals before receiving a drink. The seat was pretty standard, I had an empty one next to me, which helped. An inch in each direction would be great. Emirates saved money on the 777 by fitting 10 seats across instead of the usual 9, this leaves very small walkways, and tightens the seats up a bit. However, I'm 6'3"" and didn't have too much trouble. Just be aware, the seats aren't anything to write home about. The ICE entertainment system was good, but a bit jumpy and laggy. Otherwise, ok selection of movies. Unfortunately, my flight didn't have WiFi installed yet. Lastly, the scheduling of the flights seems silly, the Dubai airport is flooded with people at midnight. Emirates should rethink their scheduling system.",Passive
"I have become a loyal Emirates traveller over the past year with short hops in and out of Saudi Arabia on a regular basis and retained Gold status. However, this flight reminded me why I do not rate Emirates for longer haul. Flight was a hour late leaving due to slow loading of cargo and then we missed our take off slot. Drink service came 1.5 hours after take off and food started 1 hour later - but took nearly 1.5 hours to get out all courses. By this time we were 2/3rds of the way into the flight (so if we had wanted to sleep forget it) and by Dubai time (my starting point) it was gone 4pm. Food was a starter of tiny piece of smoked duck, mains were something with rice and since there were a lot on non-Chinese on the flight I think in business class there should have been another non-rice choice. My main was two tiny bits of skin covered in tasteless red gunge which was supposed to be sweet and sour chicken plus something that once may have have been pak choi but was so waterlogged it clearly had drowned weeks ago. Totally inedible. About an hour later they offered us a snack - it was barely an hour since lunch - it all smelled awful and what I saw of it was not worth touching. Sorry, Emirates, next time I fly to the Far East I will check out Qatar and will remain loyal as before to BA for London/Europe/States despite their old planes.",Detractor
"The 2nd leg of my wife's and my return flight from the Seychelles and a discounted upgrade into business class. Apart from relatively comfortable and spacey seating, nothing special. Friendly staff, but the three-course meal was served and cleared much too quickly, forcing us to eat our food much faster than we would have in economy, and making the beginning of the flight not relaxing at all. The food itself was ok for business, but not much better than in economy. Entertainment great as always. After all - only the seating justified the upgrade.",Passive
"Overall we found the experience disappointing. The seats were average, the WiFi was fine (10mb for free) the entertainment system had a good variety of programs, the food was ordinary and the service was indifferent (on our return flight one of the stewardess's was incredibly rude) although the ground staff in Dubai were fantastic. This is the 5th time we have flown this route and have had far better experiences with other airlines (Singapore, Malaysian, JAL and Saudi)",Passive
"Flight from Cape Town was late into Dubai due to traffic parked at a different terminal to the connecting flight but at a remote spot. Had to use stairs, then a 15 minute bus ride then a train ride into chaotic terminal 3 with no help at all to get to the gate. At least 20 on the arriving flight had to run for their lives to get to our gate on time. Was exhausted and not even a minute to have a drink in the lounge. The A380 great after the 777. At Heathrow waited an hour at the carousel for the luggage. No help from any Emirates staff only one bag out of three had been loaded in Dubai. They should have sent someone to the baggage reclaim to advise as there were quite a few people who had no baggage. When we got through immigration the Emirates car had left us stranded. On the return the Dubai leg was good but a repeat of the first leg the Cape Town flight parked miles away from terminal 3 and boarding was total chaos. Lugging your overnight bags up stairs I thought went out in the 60's. No amenity bags on the Heathrow - Dubai was told that if the flight is under 7 hours and in Daylight that's the new policy despite the fact you paid a premium for the ticket. I think Emirates has grown way too big to cope or care about their customers and they can't cope. Transfers between terminals in Dubai are a most unpleasant experience.",Passive
"Great flight from JFK to Milan. The aircraft is new and roomy. Lots of great entertainment to watch on the widescreen seat monitors. Seats were very comfortable. We were seated by the galley, which unfortunately, was a little noisy and was hard to sleep, but other than that, I can't wait to fly Emirates again. One of the better airlines I've been on. Our return flight home a couple weeks later was also a really good experience. Thumbs up to Emirates! (at least to this particular plane and route).",Promoter
"All was fine: ground services, cabin crew, food and beverages. The seat was very comfortable and the ICE system had a great selection of movies and other live programs. The cabin was very silent and the WiFi network worked fine.",Promoter
"The flight was delayed in Vienna. After boarding, I felt very cold due to the A/C being turned to extremely cold. I was told that the WiFi would work on this flight, however, the truth is that it didn't work. When I arrived in DXB, I had to pass through another Security Gate to transfer. The ground staff worked so ineffectively that there was a very long queue. The airport was full of people and it was very hard for me to get to my boarding gate. The second flight was from DXB to CAN. When boarding, I found that there was water leaking from the luggage rack. No air hostess came to deal with it.",Passive
"The service provided by the cabin crew was excellent, escorted to our suites, individually addressed by name. The suites are excellent and the facilities great, especially the ICE entertainment. The shower is out of this world, we both had three each. The business class bar has a good selection of drinks and snacks, the bar staff being particularly friendly. The first class bar is self serving again wth snacks and rolls,and a great selection of spirits. Not forgetting the dining, silver service with an option to eat at our own convenience. Choice of food excellent, accompanying wine and champagne first class.",Promoter
"Delayed departure of 24 hours due to a broken fuel gauge on 380, however given 2 separate Â£10 meal vouchers in the first 5 hours at the airport and then taken to 4 star hotel and again given Dinner and breakfast at the hotel. Flight to Dubai, excellent entertainment but slow inefficient service with only one stewardess per trolley resulting in trolley being left in aisle if she had to go and get something from galley. Due to travelling with a school group that had to travel together onward flight to Delhi necessitated a further 24 hour stopover in Dubai but at least in a decent Hotel. Night flight to Delhi on 777 with much better service. Entertainment system good but not to the standard as on 380. Return flights same story, quick efficient service on 777 slow and inefficient on 380.",Promoter
"Competitively priced. A380 significantly better on comfort and service than B777. B777 issues: No drinks served for three hours, inefficient and desperately slow food services, no non Halal meat option, frugal with alcohol and some stewards were rude. Emirates music now confined just to exit of plane thankfully! Positives - painless and efficient transfer at DXB, video on demand allows you to skip advertising at beginning, smooth flight and landing.",Promoter
"This was my first time trying Fly Emirates and I was disappointed. When we first arrived the plane's AC was off and everyone was hot, not to mention a 1 hour delay for departure. The cabin staff were not cooperating at all. My mother needed help with baggage and the hostess told her to do it herself. We ordered water and tea countless times until they finally responded, the inflight entertainment in my opinion is not good. There wasn't enough variety in the choice of food. When we bought the tickets they advertised it as a plane that has WiFi, which was not the case. The plane was old, the seats were tiny and not comfortable at all. The cabin manager was very helpful though and listened to our complaints and was one of the few reliable people in the staff. Definitely not going to try it again.",Detractor
"The Emirates 777 is a disappointment compared to it's A380 services. The interior was somewhat dated and tired and the entertainment system was not intuitive for the first time user and difficult to navigate once the general layout became obvious. The programs available were generally sufficient. Emirates looks after the kids well, with our youngest receiving special attention when she got on board and the gift she received was far more imaginative than the usual set of crayons and a colouring book that most airlines go for. The kids meals was also a dedicated meal rather than an adult meal with a few tweaks, though it would be nice to see some healthier options available for kids meals. The headset provided actually fit our daughter. It's these small touches that make travelling with kids easier. The seats were roomy in width and pitch and the flight to FRA was only a third full so we had plenty of room to spread out. Cabin service was generally of a high standard and meals provided were one decent and edible meal and a snack. I would fly with Emirates again, but at this stage I'm not sure what the fuss is about.",Passive
"We were disappointed with our recent Emirates flight. On our return from Paris were were informed of a 6 hour delay but without any explanation. During the delay were were provided with a voucher for one drink and one cake! When we eventually boarded it took over two hours to get a meal let alone a drink. My partner was on a special diet and his meal was put in front of him 90 minutes before mine. 4 hours later he still had the tray in front of him. When the food does arrive it's sub standard with yet another annoying snack box containing hard breads and a sweet sticky chilli sauce. Yes, the aircraft are new and the IFE ok but the attitude of the cabin crew doesn't match. They appear surly and unsmiling as if us paying passengers are an inconvenience. We encountered the same issues with the cabin crew on our outward flight. All in all a very disappointing experience.",Detractor
"We are an Australian family of four, that just returned after spending a month in Europe. We booked our travel with Emirates, travelling Brisbane, Barcelona, Paris, London, Dubai and return. The preference for our seating was booked by our travel agent for the window seats in the left rear from rows 46-49. However, on every sector except from London to Dubai, the seats were changed in every instance to those in the middle - four of us! I telephoned the booking offices at each location, who refused to help, then at the check in counter at each airport who were very unhelpful. It was a long journey which we had to endure. I found almost all of their staff, be it Cabin Crew or Counter Staff to be very robotic in their attitude. No customer service at all. No friendly disposition, no making eye contact and overall they all looked very tired. The food provided on the aircraft was more than ample. However, this is not enough to sway me to fly with them again. I did the right thing, booked our trip with them months in advance of our travel, preference of seats and very disappointed at their lack of empathy that we were travelling long distances and no courtesy in endeavouring to help. Won't be flying Emirates again!",Detractor
"We left Kuala Lumpur on time on our flight to DXB. The aircraft was slightly cold, and had no wifi. As it was night time most went to sleep, I went to sleep for a few hours. There was not the best choice of programmes, and the aircraft was one of the older ones. The meal was good and the cabin staff were nice.",Promoter
"The seats were comfortable, food edible and service very good, with the exception of one flight attendant. We were sitting near the galley and were fed up with his whingeing to the other cabin crew. He practically threw a drink at me and sneered at an elderly passenger's requests. He really stood out for all the wrong reasons as the rest of Emirates crew were great.",Promoter
Narrow seats with very little legroom. The staff were rude and with an awful attitude. Free food obviously. ICE was not what I expected. My fingers were almost broken trying to click on screen. The Boeing 777-300ers some brand new still seemed jaded. As for DXB I will return to European hubs. Disappointed my first time. Expected so much more. The staff badly need to change their attitude.,Detractor
"Last month, I traveled from JFK in New York to Milan, Italy. I only have good things to say about my experience. First of all, the plane was huge and the seats were comfortable. The food was great, the staff were helpful. There was a huge selection of free movies and music to watch and listen to during my flight. I also happened to leave my handbag on the plane on my way to Milan and I was sure that I wouldn't get it back, but as I was checking in my luggage, a flight attendant approached me with my handbag, asking if it was mine. I was pleasantly surprised. My comment is that on my flights to Milan and back, the wifi and internet did not work at all, but the movies, games, and music on the TV screens worked perfectly, so this didn't impact my experience that much.",Promoter
"Excellent, the first class private cabin offers mini bar, snacks, pyjamas, good amenities, excellent staff, amazing food. The new Dom Perignon rose is a really good idea. Had a very good sleep on a comfortable flat bed with plenty of space.",Promoter
"I was onboard EK345 on 1/7/2015 from KLIA to Dubai, departing at 9.30 am (Malaysian Time). Emirates has generally good service but I must say that the service provided by staff will supercede all other aspects. I believe a customer may forget if the landing was not smooth, the food was delayed or not to required taste, the departure slightly delayed etc etc. A rude or arrogant staff member however will be remembered and customers may reconsider their travel experience with the said airline. Again, I will rate Emirates to have given my family and I fairly good service. But I was very much upset with one of the cabin crew. I have observed harsh tones in dealing with customers in particular those elderly and who may not be proficient in English.",Passive
"London Gatwick to Shanghai via Dubai on 29th of June. First flight on A380 was a smooth, comfortable flight. Cabin serice was good and entertainment options impressive. After a long 9 hour layover in DXB, we boarded a Boeing 777-300ER to PVG, and service didn't fail to impress. Cabin crew were consistent with service, this is rare on DXB-Asia flights I have exerienced in the past. The flight was a bit cold, bring a jumper for Boeing 777-300ER flights because my returning flight from PVG-DXB on 13th July was also quite chilly. Flight from DXB to LGW was also good, however this A380 hadn't been refurbished as some of the others have, so the monitors were quite slow to respond to touch commands which was annoying. Overall 4 good flights, check in on the ground is good. I briefly used the wi fi on DXB-LGW flight but it was only 10mb free before they charge, it seemed quite good from what I could see.",Promoter
"I pressed for assistance 3 times and only once was I attended to but all 3 requests of a cup of water was forgotten/not delivered. Food was not served despite placing the sticker ""wake me up for food"". All I got was only a cup noodle. Service has declined since my first flight with them and I have been flying with Emirates once a year since 2010. Really disappointed.",Passive
"Brilliant flight as always and Emirates is known for its very comfortable flights. However, I truly feel that Emirates's standards have notched down a bit as the cabin crew are not that responsive to economy class passengers. Moreover, I had to ask for a glass of water about 5 times which is unacceptable according to Emirates standards. I am a frequent traveller of Emirates but this was not a good experience in terms of service provided. On the positive side, the seats were extremely comfortable and inflight entertainment was superb with movies from all over the world and very fine podcasts!",Promoter
"This was without question the worst Business Class flight I've ever undertaken in my life. Flight was QF8765 a code-shared flight operated by Emirates on 28 June 2015. Flying with Emirates can be a hit or miss affair based on our experiences, with the inflight service either being excellent or completely sub-standard. In this case it was the worst flight ever in terms of customer service, meals availability, and in-flight entertainment not functioning. Our flight attendant was just outrightly rude and lazy, with almost every request being met with an exasperated expression and blunt responses. It honestly felt like we were an inconvenience just being on her plane. This terrible service being followed by incomplete catering. We were offered only one meal from the menu, and there was no desserts, coffee or chocolates. The catering was terrible on this flight, however no apologies from our awful flight attendant. I had to argue with the flight attendant when she attempted to serve my teenage son with a children's meal (despite him being adult sized and holding a full adult Business class ticket). Inflight entertainment was not functioning correctly with mine and several other screens not working. We reported it to our disinterested flight attendant who said they would reset the system, however this never occurred. Upon leaving the aircraft at Sydney I reported the incidents to an Emirates ground staff CSO who was on the aero bridge. We never heard from him or had any follow-up from Emirates at Sydney. We wrote to Emirates, however with any correspondence to the complaints / complements team at Emirates there was no reply.",Detractor
"Delayed by 10 hrs found out accidentally after check-in when I noticed the boarding pass of the connecting flight showing 19.50 instead of 09.50 (initially thought it was a misprint). No active QF communication as they got my email and mobile number or why on earth did they not delay my flight to Dubai for 10 hours. Later I found out passengers booked under EK flight numbers were reshuffled to other EK connecting flights, passengers under Qantas had to see the QF counter in Dubai (see below). Flight service was extremely poor from FRA to Dubai, took 3 hrs to finish service, whole seat rows were forgotten to service and they could not fix this for 20 minutes (usually they do this instantly). Drinks were not delivered with the meal but well after, EK service has gone dramatically downhill. On arrival in Dubai plane was parked on roll field and we had the longest air field tour ever. It took 20 minutes in a barely air-conditioned bus with 38 degree outside temperature to arrive. Once the building was reached a big queue on incoming security check. Some passengers on tight connections got very nervous and I doubt they made it. Trying to find a QF counter at Dubai airport was a nightmare as the maze at this airport is indeed amazing. It took me 45 to get to the right concourse after 4 stops at info counters as no relevant signs exist. Some people told me it took them 2 hrs to get there from touchdown. Another 15 minutes to find the right exit and shuttle stop, just missed a shuttle to the express hotel - next one was only 30 minutes later. So from touchdown to arriving at the hotel nearby took 2.5-3 hrs and I walked about just short of 2km including all the extra steps trying to find the counter way. After 6 hrs or so I tried to make my way to the shuttle but long queue and not enough seats and full so had to push the hotel to organise quicker returns as a few groups were waiting also. At the same time the flight was pulled forward some 40 minutes so for those relying on the boarding pass time printed on the boarding pass was very tight, although it did not matter as another delay. Service on the Dubaiâ€“Sydney sector was good apart from the annoying new approach to service where everything is given separately, i.e. cutlery one pass, tablet, main meal, desert and drinks â€“ wonder who came up with that stupid idea? This whole experience was quite amazing and makes you realise how tricky things can get and thinking about passengers who are not able to easily walk about 2 kms or do not speak English well enough to follow the maze of instructions to even get to a Qantas counter â€“ they would have had no chance and it makes you realise how easy a connecting flight through e.g. Singapore on the same airline is.",Detractor
"WAW to TPE and back. Journey was pretty good. I was little bit upset about DXB airport terminal 3. Maybe it was modern and clean, however ""duty free"" prices had nothing in common with ""duty free"". Good thing is that Emirates provides a free-meal coupon if stopover lasts more then few hours. During all flights the crew was very kind and professional, I was satisfied with their service. Meals were above average. Only one thing really suprised me was the entertainment system in A330 flying DXB to WAW. Emirates is really proud of its system, but in that plane there were just few channels to choose instead of whole system. Moreover, quality of monitors was far from good. Very surprising. Emirates biggest strengths are luggage weight limitations, punctuality and professional staff.",Promoter
"Generally good service, but my screen console wasn't working. I told the hostess who said she would reboot the screen. Twenty minutes later after nothing had happenedI told another hostess who said exactly the same thing. Neither returned to check if the screen was working. The third hostess I asked if I could move to another seat with a working entertainment console. This was arranged but should have been done much earlier on when I told them it wasn't working. I don't think the quality of their entertainment consoles are that good, something I have noticed on other flights with them. This experience confirmed that. The seat pitch seems particularly narrow. If you drop something on the floor you can forget about trying to pick it up. I'll fly the whole way with Qantas next time.",Passive
"Bangkok to Dubai, 4 July, EK373, A380 was as expected and as usual there was a good offering of inflight entertainment choices. The inflight service was some of the worst I have experienced and my expectations are pretty low! Nearly 2.5 hours until even a glass of water was offered. I would rather they ditched the hot towels and handed out a bottle of water at the beginning of the flight if they are incapable of providing a glass of water within a hour of take off. Crew were largely invisible and on the odd occasion one would scurry down the aisle avoiding all eye contact with passengers. The only visible crew member spent most the flight speaking to friends or family in row 45. All service requests in our section ignored and a number of other frustrated passengers mystified as to what was going on. Plane arrived on time but to a stand well away from the terminal. Buses, delays and a transfer that felt like we were driving from Abu Dhabi to Dubai.",Detractor
"Very efficient booking and check in. Very good value for the money. All flights on time and excellent entertainment choices inflight. Meals were ok, not great. The only complaint would be that the staff were grumpy most of the time. Service level of the female staff was below any acceptable level for any reputable airline.",Passive
Flights on time. For dinner the last meal available had something that I was intolerant of. They managed to find me a crew meal that saved the day. What was strange was the timing of the meals. Dinner was served about 5pm departure time. Breakfast was about 5am departure time. My guess that this enabled the service of a snack and a light meal on the 6 and 10 hours sectors. Personally i'd rather have dinner at 7 on the short sector. Breakfast much later on the long sector to try to get a sleep. Serving a snack later would be enough.,Promoter
"After several Economy and Business flights on Emirates we'd accrued enough Skywards points to upgrade our return flight to First class. Emirates First class on the A380 is excellent, you get your own private cabin with closing doors. The seat is massive and very comfortable. There's a tablet remote control so you can adjust your seat into any position or lie-flat and control the TV etc. The cabin is well designed with lots of flat surfaces and a big pull out table/desk. There's a mattress and pillow behind your seat and you are bombarded with free gifts from Bvlgari, pyjamas, slippers, writing kit etc. The cabin manager will greet you and explain how to operate all the toys in your cabin and as the cabin wasn't full we virtually had our own hostess who appeared from nowhere every time you opened you doors. The food is excellent and served to order with plenty of well aged spirits, Dom Perignon, wines and soft drinks. This cabin doesn't have toilet cubicles it has bathrooms with a shower! There's also a self service bar near the bathrooms or you can use the bar at the rear of Business class. This was 8 hours of pure luxury although I would never pay for it as it's double the price of Business class which is also excellent on the A380.",Promoter
Flights on time. Arrived in Dubai and stopped a good way from from the terminal. The flight from Dubai tracked through the South of Jordan to about Cairo and then to Madrid. This avoided the troubled area in the Middle East which was comforting. The available entertainment range is truly huge.,Promoter
"I have flown Emirates many times and the experience depends on how full and/or the attitude of the crew. This flight was excellent as it was only half full and I had a whole row of 4 seats to myself. The seats in economy are arranged 3-4-3 and quite comfortable, there was no one behind so I could recline my seat. ICE entertainment was very good but not the latest version as on the A380. The food was OK and they were generous with the drinks making several runs with the trollies during the flight and picking up litter. Unfortunately this is not always the case with Emirates, I've been on full flights with bad crew who are stingy with the drinks, slow with the food then leave your tray for 2 hours so you can't leave your seat, all deliberate tactics because they can't be bothered to deal with a full flight, over 300 people.",Promoter
"BRU-DXB on Boeing 777-300 in Business class. The check in was good, and you get a fast pass through security and passports. They share a lounge with other airlines but it was ok with nice views over the runway. The flight was good with good service from the attentive staff who knew our names and occasionally stopped to chat. The food choices were good, good Moet champagne and a lot of drinks options with good aged spirits. The seats are is 2-3-2 and we always try to prebook 2 together by the window. ICE entertainment system is excellent, probably the best in the air, and very good noise cancelling headphones. The seat is comfortable with a perfect preset recline position but you can adjust it how you want or lie-flat. They provide a mattress if you want to sleep. DXB-BKK on the A380. The Business cabin is nearly all the top deck apart from 3 rows of First in the front. The seat arrangement is staggered so if you want to sit together your only choice is in the middle so you won't get a window seat. However these seats are surrounded by furniture so you're away from the aisle so very cosy. The service was excellent and the staff seemed happy to serve. The seat is different but just as comfortable and of course lie-flat. It has the same ICE system. However the beauty of the A380 is the bar or inflight lounge with it's long, comfy seats and plenty of standing area. Both flights were on time and you get a fast pass to avoid the long queues at passports in BKK and your bags have priority so will be out before you. And Emirates provide a free chauffeur service into Bangkok, we had a nice Mercedes.",Promoter
"This was my first flight on the new Emirates A380. We flew Heathrow to Dubai in economy class (then on 777 to Delhi). I've flown on Emirates 777 in economy many times which is probably the best but on the A380 it's another level. My son and I sat in the back row of 4 seats in the front section, the flight wasn't full so we had all 4 seats to ourselves, a bonus. However the seats are wider with more leg room than on 777. The ICE entertainment system is excellent with over 100 movies for a 7 hour flight and the screen is big. The headphones are ok but I recommend taking your own to block out all noise. The service was excellent, maybe because it wasn't a full flight, and the food was good and they were quick with the drinks and made several drinks run throughout the flight. The next leg to Delhi was a 777 so I prebooked the 2 seats together at the back of the plane but when we went to the gate to board we were upgraded to business class, probably because the flight was full or overbooked but another welcome bonus. The business cabin is spacious with seat arrangement 2-3-2, we were in 2 of the middle 3. The seats are cocoon, lie-flat style so I slept this leg but my son stayed awake and enjoyed the Hennessey XO.",Promoter
"Check-in took over an hour at BOM, despite the best efforts of the ground staff. Boarding was done in sequence and the ground staff ensured passengers didn't get away.

All in all would still recommend Emirates for the flight journey.",Promoter
"It was a great relief to finally have an excellent crew on this leg. My last 2 flights to BKK return left me so frustrated and very disappointed with Emirates. It's a shame for the airline because when you get an excellent crew, Emirates is a fantastic airline to fly with. Yesterday's crew provided lots of attention towards their passengers. My daughter was in economy on the same flight and agreed on the great service too. Interesting find was that when you book an Emirates flight on Qantas website, the chauffeur service is no longer approved even though it says you're eligible to it! Just be aware.",Promoter

Captain very good at communicating flight status and arrival information. Aircraft was quite new and well kept. Children's meals arrived before others and with suitable choices. Our meals ok but nothing special. Movie selection was a little disappointing compared to previous Emirates flights. I struggled to find something decent to watch. Unfortunately at DXB aircraft was parked ages away from the terminal, which meant a 20 min bus ride. Overall, a pretty good experience but still issues with making the Qantas-Emirates interaction feel seamless, especially at check-in and transit.",Passive
Our flight (EK028) from Glasgow at about 2 left on the dot. The inflight entertainment was great and the meals were excellent! The cabin crew were friendly and attentive. Drinks service were often. The seat was extremely comfy and the 7.5 hour flight whizzed by! As we arrived at peak time in Dubai we had to wait a bit. (About 20mins). The following flight (SIN-DXB) was about 3 am and was an Airbus 380-800. We got to the gate as it said gate closing athough we didn't leave for another 30mins. We got served breakfast onboard.

The seats were comfortable and the inflight entertainment was very good. There was a very large selection of entertainment. However, the flight was significantly let down by the crew. When boarding, the flight attendant at the door sent me down the wrong aisle. When serving the hot towels, the flight attendant literally threw a towel at me. During the meal service, the flight attendant gave me the wrong order. Instead, she gave me my seatmate's order (and gave my seatmate my order). Additionally during the drinks service, the flight attendant seem bothered when I asked what tea they were offering. Ultimately I thought the crew were inexperienced, tired and annoyed.

I pre booked the seats and had booked for a bassinet seat and was duly accorded. Security and Immigration was smooth and fast. Aircraft seemed a little old but was clean. Seats were very narrow and had a limited pitch. However on account of us having a Bassinet seat got enough leg room for this short haul flight. The service was efficient, they took the drinks trolley thrice and served guests each time. The selection was food. Food was good but seemed very inadequate for a full grown adult like me. Departure and arrival timings were perfect. Inflight ICE System was good and had good selection of shows and movies, though the remote seemed a bit unresponsive at times.

"JFK-DXB on the A380. Hard product is great, excellent legroom, seats had decent recline and cabin was in good condition. IFE is top of the industry and is the best. Not only do they have a plethora of TV series but they have entire seasons. My biggest gripe about Emirates is the inconsistent service. Some of the flight attendants are wonderful but most of them on this flight were rude and unfriendly. Service was extremely slow and call bells were ignored. They had very terrible attitudes which is appalling. For example, during the breakfast service, a croissant was thrown at my tray because the flight attendant was simply too lazy to lean over a bit. Trays were also left in our tables for over two hours and when I tried to go to the galley and personally put it in the cart, I was met with a shrugged look. Catering was a disappointment and options easily ran out and were unimaginative, not what it used to be. DXB is also a mess and would try at all cost to avoid. Overall, still a decent flight but I would rather fly with another airline.",Detractor

IFE is very nice with a big variety of films, music, documentaries, radios and so on. Seat were very comfortable although I flew in economy class on a 9 hours flight.

A380 has an excellent entertainment system which has many movies in CC .This is an extreme plus for me since I am deaf. The washrooms were cleaned. The food was excellent with ample choices. Lots of snacks with an open bar! The seat was comfortable even though a fellow passenger hogged up part of my seat territory. There was WIFI but I did not use it.

"JFK to Dubai with Emirates. Since it was a long flight, I expected a nice sleep but was distracted with a long tantrum from a little kid throughout the flight. The aircraft condition was good, clean. Good flight entertainment but I hope they update the selections. The food is so-so because the bakery were served cold (croissant and bun). The cabin attendant were friendly at first but maybe due to a long flight, they get tired when we were about to land, plus with that little kid. Overall, my journey was not the memorable one. It was because of negative things but not with good impression.",Detractor
"My first experience flying long haul (London-Sydney) with Emirates in conjunction with Qantas, and it has been a really frustrating experience not least an unpleasant one. Right from my 24 hr delayed flight to the customer care or the aftermath of my family vacation to the way both Qantas / Emirates handled my complaint and the treatment has been appalling. Qantas passed this fault to Emirates (operator) and Emirates blamed the airport ground staff for the delay due to a technical fault! Qantas wesbite is not very clear as there is no email contact available to directly liase with whoever's handling my complaint or customer care department. Customer service email is no longer in use, according to the automated response to my online complaint.",Detractor
"Generally, this was a very good trip. If I ever have an issue with Emirates, it is delayed or missed connections at Dubai airport, but on this trip all went to plan. Impressed by Emirates first class cabin compared to the price that Singapore Airlines charge for theirs. Food was very good. Only complaint is the older aircraft in use from Dubai-Nice, which has no wifi connectivity.",Promoter
"EK863 and EK19 on 12 June and it was a seamless experience. I've been doing this route (or one to Birmingham) regularly for over 2 years now and appreciate the consistency of the service. The A332 Muscat-Dubai is rather old but who cares for a 45-minute hop, but service is still very good. I also had a free upgrade to First to go with one from Manchester to Dubai on the outward journey, so I guess that increases the feel good factor! The leg to Manchester on an A380 was perfect. The cabin crew were good , service was efficient. A good meal, an entertaining movie, a couple of hours sleep before a light snack and then chauffeur service to get me home.",Promoter

"I have traveled on Emirates airlines since it's inception in the 1980s when I was a resident of UAE. My husband and I were very excited to become a part of the Emirates airline family once again when the routes to Asia from US were introduced. I flew the SFO to India (Bengaluru) route for the second time in 18 months last month (May) with a stop over in Dubai for 2 days. I received an e-mail confirmation 24 hours prior to my travel time. However, when I arrived with my 7 year old daughter at the airport to check in 2 hours prior to travel time, I was informed that our seats had been given away. I had even requested and reserved specific seats for our family 2 months prior to the travel date over the phone with an Emirates customer service representative. We had to wait 30 minutes and were then given 2 seats to travel to Bengaluru and then were made to rush to the gates to make the flight. I was informed by the agent who was checking me in that my seats were given away because I had not checked in online! I told her that I had received e-mail confirmation just the day of travel, confirming my seats and now I was being told that online check in was necessary to ensure getting seats to travel. Our family travels all the time in several different airlines and have never heard of online check in being required to confirm having seats! We had to deal with this same stress once again upon our return journey from Bengaluru at the Emirates check in counter. This time I had confirmed all our tickets online prior to travel as suggested. However, when we were ready to check in our baggage, we were told that my husband's seat was not available and they could not seat us together. We had to wait for 20 minutes and insist on getting the seats that we had requested and wanting to speak to the supervisor before we were finally given the 3 seats together. Once again, they said that they had to hold our seats as the flight was over booked and full. I fail to understand how this can happen to any passenger traveling on an international flight who had confirmed tickets 2-3 months prior to travel date! We arrived on time as per schedule at the airports both the times to check in luggage and followed standard Universal airlines protocol. There was no apology for all the inconvenience and stress that was caused when we were finally handed our boarding passes. The agents at the counter made it appear as if they were doing us a favor by being able to give us boarding passes and seat us together. It was very disappointing to experience all this by traveling on supposedly a World Class Award winning airline.",Detractor

"Very disappointed with Emirates as I've heard people praise them. Where do I start? Touch screens for TV/movies did not work properly, I was constantly having to press it. I had two sets of headphones and neither worked properly. Attendants seemed constantly harried with poor time management skills, although they seemed to find lots of time to have a group gossip in the galley at the back. On the Dubai-London leg the young man in the window seat near me as getting wet from an overhead drip originating in the air outlet. When he asked politely if he could move he was told curtly no he could not, even though there were spare seats. Just before we touched down in London there was announcement could the five gentlemen who should have been travelling to London Gatwick make themselves known to cabin crew. How can the Emirates staff let people booked on a London Gatwick flight get onto a London Heathrow flight? We had a good laugh about that one.",Detractor
"Flew EK372 from Dubai to Bangkok on the A380. The A380 is a magnificent aircraft! Overall, very impressed with their service this time. Complete opposite to the previous times I've flown with them. The crew were superb, chatty and greeted passengers with welcoming smiles. During the flight they were very attentive and when called there were no grumpy faces! In terms of entertainment, I don't think any airline can beat Emirates' ICE entertainment system. It's fantastic and you'd never get bored with their selection of movies offered on their enormous screens (bigger than your standard iPad!). Loved their on board cameras too. Seats and legroom on the A380 are great - by far better than their cramped 777s! The plane was also only half full so I had 2 spare seats next to me. The food was good although I wasn't very hungry and didn't finish it all but needless to say there was plenty, not to mention the extra snacks offered on board. Emirates also give you real cutlery not plastic ones. Only downside is that toilets got quite dirty and weren't taken care of by the crew (but this of course is also down to careless passengers) and WIFI didn't work properly though with all of the above, you forgot it was even there. I shall look forward to flying back with them next month. I highly recommend.",Promoter
"I have flown Emirates 3 times in the last six months but clearly customer loyalty means nothing to them. My mother, brother and I are scheduled to fly with them to Italy tomorrow for my brother's 21st birthday but we got a call from them today (less than 24 hours before our flight) to say that our flight has been cancelled and we have been moved to another flight. The problem with this is that we were scheduled to arrive in Rome at 07h25 in the morning after a short 3 hour layover in Dubai but now they were making us arrive at 20h20 in the evening after a 16 hour layover in Dubai! I have called Emirates countless times today and wasted my entire day trying to get an earlier flight and they say there is nothing they can do. We are only going for 5 days so to lose an entire day, have a 16 hour layover and lose out on all the tours we had planned is just unacceptable. Very disappointing. This is the last time I will be flying Emirates.",Detractor
DXB-LAX - June 4th 2015 - The positives: Flight departed and arrived on time complimentary chauffeur reliable pleasant and polite A380 is a great plane to fly in and off course the unbeatable ICE IFE system with large screen in Business very few airlines in the world can beat Emirates on this one. They also have changed their menu on this route a welcome initiative after goodness knows how many years the previous menu has been served on the route. The mediocre part of the trip: Service quality difference between the multinational cabin crew. Some goes the extra call of duty being very accommodating some gives you the impression that they wish to be elsewhere one stewardess was just unpleasant - I do not need to justify my second request for a burger as the serving was minuscule as a mid-flight meal. Mid-flight desert was excellent. Breakfast main sounds appetizing on menu - poached eggs turned up rather disappointing the termed boiled is more appropriate the accompanying Salmon Potato Rosti was soggy rather than crisp. Overall a disappointing plate that is just so far from its description in the menu. Lunch menu prior to arrival on the other hand is excellent. Seared Tuna loin on edamame is a welcome change to the rather boring Arabian meze. Shrimps served with polenta is a welcome option to the permanent features of the menu the plain old steak and Indian inspired dish. Dessert is excellent. Menu on this route still needs to be perfected and I know Emirates can do this judging from quality of meal/wine on board of other route (SYD-DXB).,Passive
DXB - Istanbul - DXB Y class. Gold member with EK regular flights mainly Long haul in J class this was a business trip. Both flights full to the ceiling both flights late by one hour staff obviously over stretched but in no hurry and not one I ever saw smile. Entertainment would have been good as usual with EK except the ear phones I had and changed twice were useless due to the engine noise and two men talking behind me so could hear nothing. Staff service as mentioned massive difference from J class really is a case of get them in and get them out. No call bell answered ever actually looked at me and walked off - never again Y class EK.

Flew LHR to MEL in business class. Trip I take 3-4 times per year on EK (both economy and business). Over a 12 month period Emirates scores very high on the overall product and their planes are new and very comfortable. i write this review because the last flight was plagued by uninterested cabin crew menu that never changes lack of non alcoholic beverages to match wine/champagne list (unlike Etihad and Qatar) food that was poorly reheated (business class) bread selection (again unchanged but truly awful in taste and texture) and lacked freshness and flavour.,Detractor

Flew to Perth stopping off in Dubai. Not overly impressed with Business Class Lounge in Heathrow a very limited breakfast. Boarded their new A380 and it was fabulous. I thought I was in First Class initially. Very comfortable and spacious seat and huge screen and many up to date films to watch. Very pleasant and efficient cabin crew who dispensed hot flannels (face cloths) regularly. The food was excellent and the bar at the back well words pass me. 18 year old Chivas Regal and top class nibbles (nuts and savoury biscuits). The entire flight was a singular joy and if you are using Emirates do try to upgrade if an A380 is the plane being used. Even the US pilot (he told us) seemed to have a purr of happiness to be flying this wonderful beast. So why the low assessments I hear you asking? Well it started going downhill after disembarking. Had to undergo another bag and body security check (not Emirates fault). Then the nightmare trying to find the gate for the second flight. I was given so much false information. Finally got to check in which was slow and ponderous and another bag and body security check. This time a Boeing 777. Oh! what a difference. It was old tired worn out and uncomfortable. The seat could lie flat but was very narrow preventing changing positions when sleeping. The television screen was significantly smaller too. The cabin crew were very friendly and pleasant and the food was good (just as well I like fish though). The difference between the A380 and the Boeing 777 was astounding. Come on Emirates do something about this.,Passive
Flew EK725 from Dubai to Dar Es Salaam 19/5/15. I often fly this route after flying from New Zealand and always prefer this older 777 as it consistently has a great crew brilliant service and food/drink. Much more attentive than the huge long business class on the A380's where crew walk for miles to ferry food and drink. I only marked them down on the seat as it is an older one and same for the inflight entertainment otherwise I would rather fly these older planes than the 380's apart from the bar area of course.,Promoter

"Travelled NZ to England 3 flights both ways in May. I think their standards have slipped having flown with them several times now. My main gripe is the miserable cabin crew. Hardly anyone smiles or gives eye contact. The food was ok but quite repetitive. We often didn't get to choose the meal we wanted as ""they had ran out"". It's a pity you can't give an indication of which meal you would choose prior to the flight so they can get more accurate supplies. Meals seemed a bit disorganised and drawn out at times and we couldn't believe that they abandoned the last ""sweet snacks"" round after serving half the cabin. We thought the staff were going to get more supplies or we would be served later but no. We got nothing. Then it was time to land with a 3 hour wait for the next connection so we had to purchase some drinks and snacks in the airport to keep us going. Maybe they left it too late to start the snacks round. But again better organisation is therefore needed. The staff were not seen much in between the food and drinks serving unless somebody called for them. On previous flights they often came round with extra water. But this time hardly at all which left us quite dehydrated as I didn't realise till the end you could self serve from a point on the aircraft. This should have been made known to everyone at the beginning of the flight. We had the Airbus for all of the flights which was a great. The entertainment and leg room were much needed on such long journeys. All in all we are keen to try a different airline next time.",Passive

As an avid Qatar airways traveller I thought it is only fair that I write my thoughts on my recent flight from Manchester UK to Islamabad PK with a 3 day stop over in Dubai with Emirates travelling out on 26/04/15 and returning on 13/05/15. Confession this was the first time I have flown with Emirates and not had a major complaint. Travelled with my Mother and 3 year old Nephew. The flight going from here was fairly full but the staff were extremely pleasant and helpful. The Seating was ok food etc was served on time and they were efficient. They had better inflight entertainment compared to Qatar so my nephew was kept occupied. The food served was very nice. Flight from Dubai to Islamabad was very quiet not many people were traveling so they were able to quickly serve and people were able to sleep in more comfort if required. The return flight highlight for me would have to be the A380 from Dubai to Manchester they had more entertainment for the children as well as the adults. Seats were extremely comfortable cabin crew were really sweet especially with my nephew. I have travelled on A380 last year but my experience was not very good. Only complaint on behalf of the older generation would be the amount of confusion that there was once we had got to Dubai airport due to the sheer size a train had to be caught from one terminal to the other there were a lot of people were very confused about this and I cannot really blame them. However based on the overall experience I would definitely travel with them again.,Promoter
BKK-HKG-BKK trip on EK384 and EK385 respectively on April 1st and April 4th. On the outbound leg boarding was at will. Arrived at boarding gate about an hour before the departure time and was told to go ahead and grab our seats inside the plane. The cabin crew appeared to have little or no training in their jobs. They wore dirty shabby uniform. No safety checks or seatbelt checks prior to take off as one would expect from any airline. Rushed safety announcement which was barely understandable. The meal they served resembled a frozen microwavable quick meal. I picked the chicken offering which smelt and tasted horrible. Cabin crew were mostly absent through the entire flight. On our return leg same story with the meal - I didn't even bother to touch it. IFE screen was frozen on my wife's seat and despite promises from a crew to reboot it nothing worked. Headphones for half the passengers in my section were broken as could be seen from passenger complaints onboard. I fly this route at least once a year and do not look forward to flying EK again unless desperate. The A380 is an amazingly comfortable plane to fly however EK service was a massive letdown.,Detractor
AMS-DXB-HKG and MEL-DXB-AMS. Overall I was impressed by the aircraft (especially the amount of space in the A380) entertainment and catering. The crew however in my opinion delivered a very inconsistent service along the different flights. In general the welcome during boarding was excellent personal and warm. But then the crew members differed so much that I was puzzled. Some really were excellent did lot's of extras to make you feel a welcome guest. The other half however in my opinion was either rushed tired did not reply to call button at all. No apologies/no sign of human contact were made at all on the long MEL-DXB flight after forgetting two rows on meal service not replying to call button buttons forgetting to hand out drinks ordered. It really was an accumulation of mistakes that can happen but the handling of it made me unhappy. All in all I will fly them again for the comfortable product they offer but I have tempered my expectations for the overall face to face contact during the flights which in my opinion weigh heavily.,Passive

Flight EK375 Business Class from Bangkok to Dubai on May 23 2015 on a A380. After viewing all those promotional videos from Emirates I decided to use that airline to fly to Riyadh via Bangkok and must confess that I am somewhat disappointed. The lounge in Bangkok is quite plain and sterile with a very limited choice of food. As to the flight itself seats are not ergonomic: the armrest is very short due to the separation panel between seat and corridor and the table is difficult to pull out if you are very slightly overweight. Emirates is quite stingy with amenities and even socks are taken away at the end of the flight if unused. Service was efficient but it cannot be compared with the one on Etihad where you can wine and dine anytime and where the choice of drinks and the quality of food is far superior to what is offered on Emirates. Flight attendants were relatively indifferent. The bar of course is very nice and that is the best thing on that flight. The cabin decoration is reminiscent of a hospital corridor. All in all a flight without surprise but next time I will go back to the friendly Thai people or to the excellent Etihad performance.,Passive
23 May 2015 EK 095 and EK 095. Just arrived in Dubai flying the A380 Business class seats 14 E & 14 F from Bangkok. Read so so so reviews before taking the flight. Am very surprised as really nothing to complain about. Excellent service fantastic food great seating very comfortable. I am 193 cm and experienced no problem at all with the seating despite complaints in other reviews think they must be difficult people to satisfy - it's a plane not a hotel! Would I fly business with Emirates 380 again - absolutely. Next leg is in the 777 to Rome so will review that later.,Promoter
EK435 Brisbane to Dubai A380. It was a full flight and I did not get the seat I requested however that is not unique to Emirates and the aisle seat I had 87H was ok its drawback was being knocked as people navigated the aisle. The noise from the flushing of the nearby toilets was annoying but after 14 hours and 20 minutes it takes very little to mildly annoy you. I received 3 adequate meals receiving a menu would have been nice and would have avoided much confusion and a protracted meal service as the dishes or lack of was explained to questioning passengers. Being seated at the back of the plane meant no choice of meal as they had run short of one of the options. The cabin crew from 19 countries speaking 17 different languages were young and seemed to lack any cohesion or team work. The meal services were seemingly the most unorganised I have seen but everybody ate in the end. The bar service was poor but that might be expected of this carrier but was available if you were prepared to go looking for it. The staff were not overly helpful and frequently served refreshment throughout the flight the cabin staff were commonly found in the galley areas chatting and seemed to lack some direction and co- ordination. The seat was adequate with better leg room than some carriers a foot rest would have been useful. The inseat TV screens and entertainment system were excellent. The onward flight was equally full - EK161 A330 with a similar review. This time a menu was provided and the bar did arrive in time with the meals. We were airborne without being offered any refreshment for almost 2 hours until the meal service commenced and again this was more disorganised and ad hoc than any other airline I have ever experience but again all were fed and watered. Towards the end of the 7 hour 40 minute flight the toilets were dirty the bins overflowing and toilet paper expended. These seats were less comfortable with less leg room and smaller TV screen. Overall and an average long haul experience slightly better than I expected. I would use again if the price point was enticing.,Passive
Three of us travelled with Emirates leaving Heathrow on 30th April 2015 and returning on 16th May 2015. The trip to Singapore was ok but initially food of choice was not given to us until 30 minutes later they managed to find us the curry mutton. However the complaint I have about the flight is the return trip from Singapore stopover at Dubai to Heathrow. The first leg between Singapore and Dubai was fine. It is flight from Dubai to London on the 16th May 2015 which I am most unhappy about. At the start the flight was late. The air-conditioning was not working under the heat in Dubai. The pilot did inform us of the fault with the air-conditioning but that it would be fine once we were in the air. The flight was delayed 30 minutes and we were not given water from the flight attendants. For that reason I doubt if I will fly with Emirates again.,Passive
LGW-DXB-BKK-DXB-LHR. LGW-DXB B777. I had forgotten how bad the Emirates 777 were the decision to have 4 across the middle makes the aircraft feel cramped and the one I used felt in need of a refit. The good selection of movies and TV can be let down with many faults only the left side audio worked in my seat after trying 3 different head sets I gave up and the seat next to me had to be rebooted several times before it would work. All other legs on A380 had the feeling of space and room and after the 777 was excellent but still several cabin issues either with the IFE or the seat not being able to recline fixed by a male member of the cabin crew putting all his weight on it and forcing it back. I sat it up for the meal and it would not go back again so the rest of the flight was spent upright. Meals came at odd times and the drinks came much later than the meals. As for the cabin staff they are a very mixed group so you are never sure of the level of service you will get I went on one flight to ask for a toothbrush and it was met with a look of what do you expect in economy class then the curtain was pulled shut and I was left wondering if there was one or not a minute or so later a hand comes out of the side of the curtain holding 2 toothbrushes.,Detractor
Manchester (MAN) to Dubai A380 and then on to Christchurch (via BKK and SYD) on B777. Return from Auckland to Dubai (via BNE) and Dubai to Manchester all on A380. My first time with Emirates (lots of KLM/AF in last 5 years) and overall a good experience. A380 seats slightly wider so feel more roomy but what gave most space is that with exception of one leg (BNE to DXB) seat next to me was empty. Food mostly OK (one meal was cold) but Emirates choice of meal and times seems odd. (So 10pm flight out of MAN serves eve meal but no breakfast before landing at 7am local time) next flight leaves 9am local time and then serves lunch almost immediately. On the longer legs I miss the 'help yourself buffet' cart that KLM/AF have in the galley. Cabin crew vary a lot huge range of nationalities means considerable variety in service. In A380 it takes a while to get served so your meal is eaten (or left to go cold) long before you get offered a drink. Inflight entertainment is excellent once you've got used to having adverts at the start! Overall was happy with Emirates but didn't love it. I suspect the reason they were cheapest flights is because they do everything to a tight budget and the economy experience reflects this.,Promoter
CDG-DXB-KIX NRT-DXB-CDG. A380 / B777-300ER. First time with Emirates with high expectations. In terms of aircraft's themselves not disappointed at all. Great seats (especially on the A380) with space enough to bear long flights and extremely wide selection of entertainment. What disappointed me was first of all the service. In all 4 legs almost all crew members were almost bothered to give service. No smiles at all. When you asked them something basic like a glass of water you almost felt you were bothering them. Another disappointment was food quality and quantity. Continental breakfast from DXB left me hungry for few hours. The rest of meals acceptable but not good as other European Airlines (AF or KLM for example). Overall really not in line with my expectations and not same overall level as other airlines as SQ or QF. Anyway prices keep being competitive so at the end fair value for money.,Passive
Flight EK207 Dubai-New York May 14th 2015. We boarded the plane with 400 people and no air conditioning on time with no delays. When we were moving towards the runway the plane stopped and after an hour the captain realized there was a technical issue. We were kept onside the plane for 2.5 hours with no food or water. The flight crew were most inconsiderate. It was a madhouse! People were frustrated and angry without any details on what was going on. They finally let us out from the plane into a tiny lounge (at least it had AC). Forget about food or water at this point. 1.5 hours later they boarded the same plane all over again and with total of 4 hours delay we finally took off. We were in Dubai home country to Emirates and the company couldn't expedite the problem with providing us with the new pane? It was my first and my last time with Emirates!,Detractor

I just used Emirates for the trans-Tasman trip from Auckland to Melbourne so benefited from being in a big plane. It was the first time in many years that I actually enjoyed the trans-Tasman flight. Comfortable seat tasty food (real cutlery!) and polite service. Lots of movies and TV programmes to choose from and you had the option of viewing one of three plane cameras which made it interesting. The only downside was having to return the headphones 20 minutes before landing and I hadn't finished watching the movie. A tip to take your own headphones. I would highly recommend Emirates for Aus/NZ flights.,Promoter
Flew from Manchester (UK) to Dubai on EK20 and then from Dubai to Christchurch (NZ) on EK419 (this flight stops at Bangkok and Sydney on the way. Returned from Auckland via Brisbane to Dubai on EK 435 and then to Manchester on EK17. EK419 is on a B777 with the remained on A380's. Cabin crew are variable but mostly good I suspect the multinational nature of crews contributes to this variability. The connection time in Dubai for the outward leg was 90 mins but there was someone at the gate who met me and other transfer passengers with shorter connections and escorted us to transfer buses. On most legs the food was reasonable (except for the hot meal from Auckland which was nearly cold by the time I got it) though the decisions about when and what to serve seem bizarre. For example the flight leaving at 7:30am served lunch 2 hours into flight and on the return I got two evening meals served 3 hours apart. Unlike KLM/AF who I've flown with lots in last 5 years there is not a self service buffet mid flight on the long haul legs. Entertainment system is excellent though it's unusual to have adverts on aircraft. Seats were OK a bit wider on A380. Overall it feels rather formulaic: fine when it all works but with no margin for error.,Promoter
EK722 NBO-DXB business class Seat 9J. 777-200. NBO airport a total nightmare. Why EK even bothers inviting passengers to its lounge there when it is standing room only is beyond me. I couldn't get out of it fast enough. The terminal was painful particularly the gate area. Once on board not overly impressed with the seat. Crummy selection of newspapers. I was chatting with my seatmate but the privacy divider would not retract which made conversing awkward. We were in the air for well over an hour before I had anything to drink something that would never happen on QR SQ or CX. The lead FA for the business cabin came around asking people how their experience was so far and seemed to be aware of the horrors of NBO airport.,Detractor
I travelled from Heathrow to Dubai and then onto Singapore. On my return it was from Tokyo to Dubai and then onto Heathrow. As far as I am concerned it has been the best airline that I have travelled with. Seating and leg room was more than enough (I'm 6 foot). The food was adequate but how many breakfasts and lunches can you eat? Mine was a total of 8. One consideration which I was very pleased with is the fact that I am asthmatic and every time without exception I have ended up with a cold or infection. Not this time on all of the above flights. This must mean that Emirates change the air filters more often than others.,Promoter
I have not taken an international flight for many years but before then I travelled overseas all the time often with 2 small children (by myself). This trip I flew Sydney - Dubai - Dublin for Christmas 2014. Then returned Manchester - Dubai - Sydney in Jan 2015. I found on all flights that the cabin crew were fighting amongst themselves and were not interested in the passengers at all. I felt that it was an imposition to ask for anything. I went to the galley and asked for something to eat when most were sleeping and was told that food would be coming soon. It came 2 hours later. The cabin crew were sitting/drinking/eating and arguing. The meal thing surprised me as I had never been hungry on an international flight before. We were fed twice in 14 hours. Otherwise it was as you expect.,Passive
I flew PRG-PER and SYD-PRG both through DXB and was satisfied. The staff was friendly and helpful seats comfortable and spacious enough the planes (B777 on all legs except for SYD-DXB which was on the A380) were (or at least seemed) new and the vegetarian meal was surprisingly tasty. Both of the flights between Dubai and Australia were only half-full making it much easier to sleep. The only hiccup along the way was high traffic at the Dubai airport due to which we had to stay in the air for an additional 30 minutes. I also had to re-book my second flight (the charge for this is 99 euro) which I did over the phone in about ten minutes and without any problems. After flying with Emirates before I had high expectations going on this trip and it's safe to say that they've been met.,Promoter

I flew with my wife and 3 year old son from Auckland to Dubai via Brisbane and then a few days later onto London all on A380s. Our son was given a pack with a book and activities as well as a blanket and toy on all the legs. On the way to Brisbane it took an hour before any refreshments were offered. Interestingly going to Dubai they didn't provide him with a child's meal claiming we had to order it in advance (but surely they can see on the passenger manifest he is a child?) We asked our stewardess on the first leg if she could find one. She said she'd be back in a couple of minutes and we never saw her again. We asked someone else to see if they could organise one for going on to Dubai and same again. On the way to Dubai the lights were left on way too long. Yet when we went to London our son was given a child's meal straight away and the overall level of service was very good. The meals we got were very good although the breakfast frittata was a bit overdone. No complaints about the superb entertainment options though. So same airline for two flights but two quite different levels of service.,Passive
I flew on 21st April 2015 from Bangkok to London I had my baby with me and was feeling very nervous about flying with her but the staff were so friendly and helpful. When my baby cried they helped me calm her down especially one staff member who saved my sanity he even made me an iced coffee with out me asking. The second flight was not as great as I felt the staff weren't as friendly and welcoming I had the assistance light on for over an hour and no one came and when I tried to wave someone down they would just ignore me. You could also hear a few of them moaning about being tired and hungry which I don't think is very professional. The main thing I would say that was bad was at the baggage claim when the buggy's were the last items to be put round the belt so there was a lot of tired babies and parents waiting for their buggies.,Promoter
Flight EK225. Dubai to San Francisco. Airbus 380. Pathetic and Rude Infight service. Basic reply there are 400 plus passengers and 8 crew members only. If crew are short staffed is it a passenger problem? Terrible service at baggage claim more than 2 hours. Reason short staff.,Detractor
On a recent flight EK435 (A380) from Brisbane to Dubai on the 18th of April 2015 the flight had a technical problem shortly after passengers were boarded at 20.30 hrs. Resolution took over 3.5 hours during which all passengers were kept on the airplane with no food or drinks. Water and some fruit juice was distributed reluctantly by the crew after being repeatedly asked it appeared they did not want to go through the bother of having to open and close the trolleys before the flight took off! The Captain made a few sporadic announcements in the 1st hour of waiting and then disappeared leaving announcements to the Purser. All in all the 14 hour flight took all of 17+ hours. The food was as usual substandard the drinks as a few have mentioned only appeared after the food was served! I dread the day they are going to launch the new revamped A380!,Detractor
"Was on the Emirates flight Dubai to Delhi in February. Have done this route several times. They have this weird practice of serving meals before serving drinks which is the norm even on their other flights. It appears like they'd rather not have the passengers order any drinks which are advertised as included in the flight cost. Secondly meal choices advertised on their Menu cards are almost always not fully available - its always ""Oh sorry we've run out of this option so all we can serve is this"" Great - than why offer a choice in the first place. Seats are cramped with lower than average legroom.",Detractor

Food quality on board the B777 and the A380 was very poor. I travelled via Dubai to Tokyo and returned to Gatwick after a four night stop over in Dubai.

We recently flew Emirates to Dubai and then connected to Kuwait. The food and service was second to none. When we flew back from Kuwait our flight was delayed. We originally had 1hr and 30 mins between flights. By the time we landed in Dubai and reached the terminal it was 7.20 am local time. Our flight to Birmingham was due to close at 7.30 am! We ran like crazy to our gate A17. By the time we got there it was 7.35 am! We were then told our gate had been changed to A4. There was no way we were going to make it. The guy at the desk phoned through to gate A4 and told them he had 2 passengers and would personally bring them himself. He then picked up my wife's hand luggage and carried it to a buggy. We made it last ones on the plane but would never have without that member of staffs assistance.,Promoter
Flying to Dubai from Manchester on 15th March 2015 Boeing 777 flight EK022 seat 21e and 21d. We found the service very poor. The female flight attendant never smiled or offered any greeting. We were not offered any drinks but had to ring the call button twice to get a response. On the second occasion for some water again rang twice and from the first call to receiving the drink was just over 11 minutes. This was before and after lunch not at a busy time. At lunch we had to ask for coffee which the male attendant leaned over to pore I had to ask for milk and sugar. The coffee was lukewarm and the attendant was equally out of sorts with himself. We have never had this treatment on previous Emirate flights. I wondered if we were on a no frills flight or was it because we can only afford to fly economy. Our return on 30th March was just the opposite with friendly crew and excellent service.,Passive
Seattle-Dubai-Delhi and return. My first time with Emirates. Flew economy. 777-300 on all the legs. Positives: decent meals plenty of choices in IFE baggage offloading was quick. Negatives: for some reason during SEA-DXB leg the formation of two lavatories each per section didn't seem to work very well. There always seemed to be a line up. All four times they seem to be always taking off a bit late from all the four points of departure. We were bussed to the terminal at DUB on arrival from DEL which took extra 30 minutes of our lay over. Cabin crew could use a bit more politeness. Too many announcements and most of them were barely audible and sounded like mumblings. Overall not bad but I was expecting a bit more.,Passive
Doha to Dubai EK848 and Dubai to Zurich EK087. Both flights were 25 March 2015. Emirates was a great airline but lately its service levels are declining. We took a trip from Doha to Zurich with connection in Doha. On first leg we asked for blankets but no attention was given until flight landed and on reminding air hostess were told that no blankets were available on flight. On second leg the food was quite poor and head phones were collected 30 minutes before landing. Certainly service levels have declined significantly compared to 2 years ago.,Detractor
I was flying from Melbourne to Warsaw my plane from Melbourne was late and I lost the connection from Dubai to Warsaw.

Staff lacking the extra mile with far too many announcements unrelated to flight safety really disturbing at night time. Flying just once with Emirates is probably enough.,Passive
"Just returned from a 3 week break to Oz Manchester to Brisbane (via Dubai) Sydney to Manchester (via Dubai). Have to say I was thoroughly impressed. Yes the service wasn't fantastic from all the cabin crew. Yes the meals weren't fine dining yes improvements can be made but if my 4 legs of this trip is anything to go from I would definitely recommend Emirates A380 services to others. We sat all 4 legs in 59 ABC in order to have the most stable journey so didn't test the levels down the length of this massive aircraft however what we received was extremely good and am looking at booking again for this 22 hour journey with Emirates on the A380. If I were to be critical then improving the food offering would be good and using ""secret shoppers"" to test flight attendants would help I interacted with around 20 flight attendants during these 4 legs and 18 were great it's funny how 2 from 20 will stick out more in my mind. Emirates need to be careful with traffic flow as we had an hour circling prior to landing in Dubai due to congestion and then 3 hours later had an hour sat on stand waiting for a slot due to congestion. In essence I'd definitely recommend the Emirates A380 service safety and comfort are first rate and with a few improvements I'd say even economy is first class!",Promoter
BHX-DXB-BKK 1st April 2015 777 then A380 - EK 0384 and EK 0040. A Tale of Two Cities! The contrast between these two flights was vast so the data below is an average of both hence here is my review for each leg. Leg One Birmingham to Dubai. Plane full seats squashed leg room limited staff mainly rushed and miserable touch screen sensitivity useless. Leg Two Dubai to Birmingham. Plane full seats much larger in width and leg room wonderful attentive staff new screen with light touch sensitivity. No headphones provided to me. The price was Â£480 return with a return in July which was excellent and was much cheaper than from HRW with a better and shorter DXB layover of 2 hours. Would use again. Two gripes - advertisements at beginning of films and shows annoy me so an ability to just watch 20 seconds of a bit of each film in order to get the gist of it would be great I have no time to wade through numerous adverts just to eliminate 80% of the substandard films. Gripe Number Two yes its the Emirates Music! Great when you only fly them occasionally but hideous when it just goes on and on and on a four chord repeat monotony come on Emirates how about the sound of silence?,Passive
We have flown with Emirates more than 20 times. In the last 4 months we flew Business Class 8 times and First Class once. We have experienced 2 great flights with them but 6 awful flights. Emirates call centre were disorganised and provided conflicting information when we called to try to make changes. The crew in general are by far the worst we have experienced on any airline (including budget airlines). On 4 of the recent flights my wife was pregnant. Emirates made very little attempt to make the flight any better for her. We have flown with Emirates various times over the last 7 years and have found the experience increasingly worse. The food in Business Class has been paired back so much that it is almost inedible. They have chosen to use extremely cheap bread and pastry products as filler. The food at Singapore Business Lounge was inedible I say this as a statement of fact not a complaint. I returned to the main terminal and purchased food and drink from there and brought it back into the lounge. The chauffeur service is also highly variable. At Singapore we were collected by an 8 year old souped up mini van (replete with flashing lights inside and worn out interior) instead of the limousine they promise. We fly a combination of Business and First Class when we use Emirates our reason for this is to try to avoid undue stress when travelling to or from a holiday destination. Unfortunately we have found that for 75% of the time we come home feeling frustrated. We are going to try BA and Virgin for our future trips - I would highly recommend avoiding ever using Emirates airlines.,Detractor
I flew Emirates from Vienna to Harare in March. The difference in quality of aircraft from VIE-DXB to DXB-HRE was staggering. The Africa-bound plane was old the seats were narrow and uncomfortable (comparatively) the in- flight entertainment system was archaic (without even the detailed route tracker that is the standard of other Emirates planes). Before opting for the Business class flight I had flown Emirates coach a number of times and on the newer planes it is far superior to business on the Harare route if value for money is something you care about. Incredibly disappointed. The massive gulf in quality between the Europe-originating route and the Africa-bound one was massive. Unforgivably so given the fact that we were still expected to pay a premium. Poor showing Emirates.,Detractor
"My wife and I flew return business class from Toronto to Bangkok via Dubai. The Toronto to Dubai leg on a newer A380 provided excellent cabin service and food with the exception of the hot breakfast which was well below par. Upon arrival in Dubai we found The business class lounges to be very comfortable providing a good selection of food beverages and reading materials. The Dubai A380 leg went smoothly except for that hot breakfast again which once again proved inedible. The return flight A380 from Bangkok to Dubai was on an older series A380 and was a lot less comfortable due to a built in footrest which prevented me from stretching out my legs. I found this to be very debilitating as I have a bad knee and I was very uncomfortable unless I put the seat into the flat bed position. The Dubai - Toronto return leg was once again on a newer A380 and provided more comfort than the older A380. I still had not learned from my earlier hot breakfast experiences and fell for it a third time. This was by far the worst of all the three breakfasts and I took it upon myself to complain about the poached eggs that had the consistency of hockey pucks. The cabin crew were very apologetic and acknowledged that it was an ongoing issue. Overall the Emirates business class experience was expensive mainly pleasant but could be significantly improved. The chauffeur service was excellent however everything else isn't where it needs to be yet in order for me to stop shopping around for alternatives. My comments and suggestions are listed below. Business class seats are narrow and uncomfortable especially seats F & G which are only separated by an armrest. I was travelling with my wife so we didn't need to use the privacy screen which rises vertically from the armrest. Unfortunately even when it is not in use it still protrudes vertically from the armrest by approximately 9"" preventing use of the armrest for it's intended purpose or even holding hands with your significant other if so inclined. In business class the lounge 4 washrooms galley and stairs to the lower level are all at the rear of the aircraft. This can make for a very busy area particularly with cabin crews comings and goings. It also makes for a very long walk to the washroom if you are seated near the front of the business class section. Kudos to the cabin crew as they delivered all food on trays without resorting to the use of trolleys which would obviously restrict passenger movement and clog up the aisles. Having said that requests for individual items can be met by comments such as ""I'll be back in a minute"". When I mentioned to a member of the flight crew that the flight tracker program wasn't working during the Toronto return leg it was just met by a shrug of shoulders and no explanation? My biggest beef regarding my first Emirates experience is that we never once saw the plane's purser (cabin manager) on any flight as they never appeared from behind the curtain that separates first and business classes.",Passive
"I am a frequent traveler with Emirates and am sad to say it is all going downhill. MNL-DBX-AMM and CAI-DBX-MNL on the way back. The B777-300 ER is a nice plane with departure at 12.20 am. With all the time spent in the airport and the lousy lounges at Manila airport (not airline's fault) one gets to the flight starving. Just to find out they have ""Light Bites Service"". All options below business class standards. Tiny portion leaves you starving for the rest of the flight until breakfast comes. No service in between. This service takes more than two hours to be completed when people want to go to sleep as soon as possible. Then the connection to Amman was far worse. A330 plane is really bad when the passenger in front of you fully reclines you end up with his head on your lap. When things couldn't get worse they did on the way back. Ground staff at Cairo are as bad as the airport itself. No priority boarding long faces a true mess. Fortunately I was served dinner as it was dinner time. B777-200 also a very bad aircraft. My ICE screen got stuck when the guy in front of me reclined fully. Crew did nothing. Then another red-eye to Manila more ""Light Bites"" service crew took three hours in offering the duvet for the hard seats (by then they already woke me up). These flights require super-fast bed service not three hours after. An really can't you afford a true meal? Really disappointed.",Detractor

DUB-DBX-PEK and return. Four Emirates Flights in the last 6 days. First sector from Dublin to Dubai was astonishingly poor for an airline as reputable as Emirates. Chaotic boarding late departure - 1hr 10 minute delay. Staff onboard were generally surly abrupt extremely rude and unhelpful. One particular stewardess on this flight demonstrably lacked the people and interpersonal skills required to carry out her responsibilities. The aircraft's ICE system was particularly ineffective and difficult to navigate. However the further three flights resonated as if it were a completely different airline. Staff were utterly professional courteous caring and engaging throughout. The PEK-DBX flight epitomised the standard for exemplary customer service in every way albeit helped by the fantastic A380-800 aircraft used on this sector. Despite the first let-down Emirates will be my airline of choice for any future longhaul international travel.,Promoter
SYD-CDG-LHR-SYD. With stops either way in Dubai. Hadn't flown Emirates since 2005 and very mixed reviews but I had to book a trip due to a family illness in England literally booked 4 days before flying and Emirates gave me a very good price. On all 4 sectors I flew A380s couldn't fault them the planes were clean staff were courteous ICE was excellent and meals not too bad and above all the toilets were kept very clean flew in the forward economy section on 3 sectors and it felt very cosy.

DUB-DXB-PEK and return. First time to fly Emirates. Three flights on the Boeing 777-300 one on the Airbus A380-800. 3/4 sectors typified the renowned Emirates service but DUB-DXB left a lot to be desired with surly uninterested and even some ignorant cabin crew. Some even refused to bring water to passengers. Disgraceful conduct. The IFE system was also difficult to navigate on this sector leading to a less than satisfactory flight. However all other sectors were extremely good particularly service aboard the A380 from PEK-DXB. Staff were exemplary chatty smiling engaging and above all courteous. Our group received complimentary champagne on two occasions during the flight. They went out of their way to make us feel at home. Space was very good the IFE fantastic and food was excellent.

Traveled on 24th March 2015 flight EK435 from Auckland to Paris stop over Brisbane then onto Dubai. I would of appreciated more move selection the same with the music. 25 mins before landing our headphones were collected. Why? Flight attendants were slow bringing drinks. Flight from Brisbane to Dubai (13 hrs) I recalled them coming around with water 4x. I had to get up to ask an attendant to fill my water bottle because they were too busy talking in the food prep area. Meal selection always ran out by the time it got to the back rows. On our final flight the first meal from Dubai to Paris was served 3hrs into the 7hr flight it was breakfast of what was left over and not everything on the menu. Lunch again was what was left over and too salty I requested cheese and crackers and got told she'd come back after she served the drinks but I got nothing. One of the toilets (Brisbane to Dubai flight) soap dispenser was broken and soap seeped out onto the floor making a huge wet slippery surface. There was never moisturizers or spray in it and there was always one toilet not operational. I paid for a flight that covered all its services why should I be made to feel like my needs are not important. I didn't request extra food or alcohol I just wanted my choices on the menu toilet paper soap spray refreshers and moisturizer in a clean toilet and to be able to listen to good music and get water without having to ask.,Detractor
DMM-DXB-BKK on March 26 - In Economy Emirates has a solid offering few airlines can match. Crews are friendly courteous. I wonder why these crews are not deployed on the long haul route such as LAX even on Business Class of the same route need crews like this set to work on. For example there was a crying infant who tirelessly screamed pretty much the entire flight much to the annoyance of many passengers. One of the crew offered the mother to look after the screaming child although not taken by the offered customer her kindness and customer orientation is surely noticed by other passengers. Food on this route is enjoyable Asian style chicken. Got upgraded to Business on the first leg which is very nice of Emirates to recognize my status with them. Seat is a bit hard on the A380 however bearable on a short and medium haul flight. I can not imagine sitting in that seat for a long haul 16 hours flight to LAX.,Promoter
"ADL-DXB-VCE return March 2015. B777-300ERs all legs. First time on EK and must say I was impressed certainly compared to QF long haul. Able to use the Qantas lounge in ADL due to QF status nothing out of the ordinary but you need to allow time to pass through immigration etc at the gate. Boarding started well ahead of time (on all legs) and was strictly by seating zone which worked well and lead to on time departures all 4 legs. I prefer an aisle seat and on 3 of the 4 legs the middle seat was unoccupied. Chose the small Y class section just behind business which was good. I found the seat and leg room good but then I am quite short. Note that aisle seats don't always have power plugs but the USBs worked well. ICE was impressive but the relentless ads got a bit annoying after a while even though you can fast forward them. Service was universally good and friendly albeit with the inevitable slightly ""plastic"" airline feel to it. Hot towels menus small amenity kit. Food was more than adequate on all legs and always got my preference. Trays cleared away promptly regular drinks runs and staff seemed to respond to individual calls. Liked the mood lighting overnight and slept well. Transit in DXB worked well no long lines at security even a peak hours. One bus transfer but very efficient. Used the lounge in DXB - yes its big but just move away from the central hub and there are lots of quiet spots to chill out. All in all I was happy with my flights and would certainly use EK again on these experiences.",Promoter
I flew business class from New York to Dubai. I was so looking forward to it since I heard that it was in a class by itself. What a disappointment. The crew were well scrubbed in their uniforms and led me to my seat. It consisted of a small cube like area with a nice sized video screen. I soon found out that the space was very constricting. My wife was next to me and a partition between us was lowered but not all the way. There was a 4 inch portion that still protruded that did not allow for comfortable placement of my arm. The lie flat seats were not truly lie flat. By the way this was an A380 and the seats were more 175 degrees. The head area seemed a little bit elevated. There was a cushion-mattress that was given to place over the reclined seat that did make it more comfortable but the confined space of the pod like area was uncomfortable. I could not really move my arms very well around my head. I had flown Air New Zealand a few months ago and their business class on a 777 was far superior. When I arrived on New York on the return the flight was an hour late. Even though my baggage was checked thru to Jetblue when I went through customs and tried to recheck the baggage I was told it was too late for it to be transferred to the Jetblue flight. It was 55 minutes to the flight and they needed an hour at least. The Emirates rep said she could not help me. I thought that she could have provided a porter to take the luggage over to Jetblue with me but I had to do that on my own.

BRU-HKG via DXB return 1st class. Fab driver pick service in all legs from residence to airport to hotel and back and to residence. A big plus! Check in fast as it should be. Fast track and lounge a pity. EK uses SN lounge and it is outdated and crowed always. Whatever time of day. Used not only by Star alliance members but also other partners too which makes it too warm overcrowded and nowhere to seat. Boarding ok and then the usual fab experience of EK first class although on B777 suites are smaller and not the luxury of showers. No amenity kit either. Connecting in Dubai is a mess. Non one around and the first class in concourse C is small and not that good. Again boarding to HKG very average and not prioritized as it should be. A380 excellent experience not my first one with them but meals are very average. Excellent ICE. Return on HKG - Dubai leg not so good staff were rude and unpleasant. Again connecting in course C is a mess. Last leg ok. Bag not first out and unfortunately zip was broken and lock missing. To have the bag repaired took me forever and wasted a whole day waiting for a pick up service who after an 8 hour wait never turned up. Very disappointed. Customer service is not good either. However staff in EK office in BRU helpful and hopefully all will be sorted out soon. Not yet done though. I only fly them 1st class and am a gold member but I will think twice when choosing EK again.,Promoter
EK038 4 Mar 15 BHX to DXB. One and a half hours delayed. No drink service offered for another one and a half hours. Dinner then served without drink meal eaten before wine was served. On checking the menu I hate curry so informed the stewardess asking her to save me the alternative but she forgot so no main course for me. Very stressful flight due to worry about missing connection. Next year it's BA direct for us.,Detractor
Outward from Heathrow 24/3/15 EK002 to Dubai. Dubai to Mauritius EK701. Homeward Mauritius to Dubai EK704 on 11/3/15. Mauritius to Heathrow 12/3/15 EK001. Patchy service. If you did get a drink prior to take off it was immediately taken away. The seats were not clean. I actually found dry noodles on my seat on one leg of the journey. I had soup and scrambled egg served cold. You then have to sit and stare at your tray for 20 minutes or more after you have finished one course then wait again for the next. The staff are far too busy not enough of them no team work. Have flown Emirates Business Class before and was pleased but not on the huge A380. The only advantage was a fully flat bed but not too much of a bonus when the seats are not clean. Dubai Business Class lounge is like a transport cafe. Too big too few comfy seats too few ladies toilets. All in all not value for money. Awful.,Detractor
LHR-DXB - Seats spacious and ICE entertainment system excellent with a wide selection to choose from and a very large screen. However most disappointing was the crew onboard as they were very rude and made us passengers seem like an inconvenience. I was expecting a lot more from an airline like emirates in terms of customer service onboard. The food was also quite poor even for economy class.,Passive
LHR to KUL via Dubai RT. Business class. Best business seat I've sat in on the A380 out of LHR. Service excellent - pity the meal I wanted wasn't available - and as I was not among the last to be served this was not a good sign of forward planning the catering supplies. The bar at the back upstairs is of course a great bonus!,Promoter
Airbus 380 LHR-DXB and return. Normally fly Qatar but Emirates were more convenient times so I gave them a go. Overall good but not as good as Qatar. Not impressed with the 380 Business cabin they've tried to squeeze in too many seats. OK I'm big but I've never had to ask for a seat extender before in business. Couldn't get the tray fully extended difficult to sleep as too cramped. Cabin staff excellent but due to size of cabin (over 20 rows) we got our wine after we had finished our food. Food fine. So much better than BA but some way to go to match Qatar. Airbus 340 DXB-COK and return. Older than 380 but more room so more comfortable.,Promoter

I regularly fly Emirates from LGW-DXB-MNL and return. I have never had an issue until my last flight from Manila to the UK. Arriving at Manila for check in found that the flight was overbooked and Emirates were asking for volunteers to give up their seat. As a Silver member I was advised that I would be upgraded to business class for the MNL-DXB leg of the journey and all seemed well. The service on this leg was great meals were excellent and the business class cabin was roomy and comfortable. The only downside with this flight the entertainment system which wasn't working in Business class for most of the flight. The second leg from DXB to LGW was in economy class and this version of the 777 was very cramped much more cramped than previous Emirates 777 flights. Service was good though when trolley service was completed they struck the arm rest with the trolley breaking the headset plug leaving the prongs embedded in the socket. This resulted in the rest of the flight with no sound for entertainment system. Arriving in London found that there were issues with my baggage.,Passive
Dubai to Sydney Economy Class. After reading other postings here for Emirates just had to add my comments. I have travelled Emirates for many years but I feel customer service from the crew is getting worse. Friendly FAs are rare these days. The others just do the minimum of what needs doing without a smile. Almost knock you over if you are in their way. A couple of people took our seats and wouldn't move but the FAs couldn't care less. The once fabulous selection on ICE is deteriorating too. Plenty to see but a poor selection in English unless you like violent movies. Whatever happened to the snack pack with a drink at the beginning of a flight? Not served on my flight. Some passengers rang for the FA but they didn't come. Yes some might ring for minor things but on the other hand it could be an emergency. Annoying things on a long 14 hour trip these small things make a difference to the passengers. Lift your game Emirates or more people will be looking elsewhere. I firmly believe any airline is only as good as its crew. I am due another flight next week to Europe. Hope this is a better experience.,Passive
Flew Kuwait - DXB and DXB - Doha. Food drink and inflight entertainment is only what we can dream about on a short hop in Europe. However the crew were absolutely miserable. All of them. The crew also made no effort to enforce safety. During taxi there were people wandering around the cabin without being challenged at all.,Passive
QF8423 27/2/15. Perth-Dubai - business cabin. (Qantas partner). Beautiful lounge with excellent friendly service. Plane clean and smart with seats/flat beds very comfortable. Nicely appointed well decorated cabin crew helpful attentive and smiley. Food although not exceptional was more than acceptable and service was first class. No complaints whatsoever about the flight. The problems began at Dubai. Very busy so held before landing. Dumped at least a 20 min bus trip from terminal. No information of where connecting (Qantas) flight was departing from. No one in terminal to ask. Inserted boarding pass into state of art machine that was supposed to tell us where to go - it didn't. 15/20 min fast walk to train to change terminals. Rush to gate and just made it as gate was closing. 4 people at least didn't make it and had bags off-loaded. This was simply not good enough. Took the edge off the whole Emirates experience - such a shame. Would imagine this problem will go once airport finished! Would fly Emirates again but would in the meantime ensure at least 3 hour transfer time. Qantas booked this connection not us.,Passive
MAN-SYD and return. Couple of slight delays on take up but the airline made up the time and managed to land close enough to schedule. A380 all the way which is excellent because the business class cabin allows every seat to have direct aisle access so no stepping over your neighbour. Excellent storage and your own little mini bar in each seat. Bar at the back of the plane is great for taking a break on the 14 hour leg from Dubai to Sydney. Food good and IFE the best.,Promoter
From DFW 12/26/2014. From MAA 1/19/2015. I have been flying out from Dallas/Houston to couple of cities in India. Over the years Emirates have squeezed economy (or cattle class) as much as possible. Sometimes the behavior of the crew is surprising. Food is good however the overall service is okay only. Given that Qatar and Etihad now flies out of Dallas I will avoid Emirates in future.,Detractor
EK010 LGW-DXB was on an A380. The plane seemed very new with nice entertainment system and it was updated with the latest IFE system with a 10 inch HD screen. Seats were comfortable with lots of space to straighten your legs cabin crew were nice and friendly and food was delicious. The next flight from DXB-BOM was on an outdated B777-300 seats were quite old including the IFE system but the content was almost the same cabin crew were not friendly they seemed to be in rush all the time food was ok. On return my flight from BOM-DXB was on a B777-300ER and that was another plane with much more better seats and IFE system compared to the one I had from DXB-BOM although the service was nice and cabin crew were better with no rushing. On the A380 from DXB-LHR the plane was the same but the seats and screen of the IFE system were the same as the B777-3ER although the whole flight was nice was a bit disappointed with the system as the one I got from LGW-DXB was new. Will fly again with them.,Passive
Boarded EK040 20/2/15. From Birmingham on time taxied to runway then had to return for an hour delay due to immigration once taken off cabin service was good the ICE entertainment system was not as good as it should be once nearing Dubai we were told we were in a holding pattern due to sand storm all connecting flights would be held once landed after an hour circling rapidly made our way to departure gate as notice boards stated final call. Got to the gate and plane had already gone. We made our way to transfer desk where nobody would offer an explanation as to why we couldn't land but connecting flight could take off we were given a new flight EK 372 a delay of 6 hours boarded on time but then told we couldn't take off due to sandstorm sat on plane for 3 hours before moving yet planes all around us were taking off finally landed in Bangkok 11 hours late the only thing that helped me from going mad were the excellent cabin staff. Must also make a mention of excellent Chauffeur service. Emirates wants to be worlds best airline not even best in Middle East. Will go back to Qatar for next flight.,Detractor

EK584 I sat on 40A in the back cabin of the aircraft there were empty seats but only the window seats are full.

"EK 10 on Jan 4th onto EK 770. Noticed that 25% of passengers received a drink before take off. Crew too busy to serve all of us. No drink service for the 2hr 27min. Each request met with ""it will be along shortly"". I realize that is why so many regular business travelers dashed to the bar before the seat belt signs were switched off. The meal was still cold when I mentioned this I was told that ""it had been dealt with in accordance with instructions and we are very busy"". It is very obvious that Emirates do not carry enough crew on the A380 to serve everyone the same in the business section. Make sure that you are not at the back! The next leg of the journey on a smaller plane was far better. They just did not bring the luggage.",Detractor

Flew as a package Heathrow to Dubai Dubai to Colombo Colombo to Male Male to Dubai Dubai to Heathrow. On all of our paperwork we had numbered seats together. We actually sat in these seats on the first flight and never sat together again. After 3 days in Dubai we arrived at the airport after midnight to find that there were no seats on the plane so ours had been sold to someone else. We waited to see if there would be seats as we had a connection waiting for us in Colombo. Desk was hopelessly undermanned and after a long wait no seats available anywhere on the plane. After 20 minutes or so it was clear there wasn't a hotel to go to either so spent an uncomfortable night in a cold Dubai airport with a voucher for probably the cheapest meal in the cafe. Got on the next plane in the morning which was delayed by an hour. We did get a voucher to travel from Dubai to Colombo! How this airline has built a reputation for being one of top carriers is beyond us. The only thing that was better than the cheapest airlines was the entertainment system but no way can this make up for the rest of our experience. We did write to express how we thought that our experience should be giving real cause for concern to customer relations. Never got a reply.,Detractor
My advice would be to avoid Emirates until Dubai Airport improvements have finished: too many planes have to park out on the apron meaning 30 minutes extra until into the terminal delayed baggage and rushed connections. Customer Service standards also seem to be slipping. On arrival at the airport I was informed my flight was delayed 3 hours but wasn't told that an earlier flight was also delayed and I could have caught that one and still made an onward connection. The previous couple of flights also had delayed arrivals (up to 2 hours) and therefore incredibly rushed connections (with onward flight delayed to wait for connecting passengers). Hope they return to previous high standards soon.,Detractor
"My wife and myself flew from Glasgow to Sydney return January and February 2015 on economy. The worst flying experience. Five Emirates flights and all of them delayed! On two of the flights home they failed to serve two meals they even had the gall to state ""due to inclement weather economy meals will not be served"" OK if you were business or first but economy forget it! On the last flight back from Bangkok to Dubai the flight was late arriving we were met by Emirates staff who said our flight was being held for seven of us. We were rushed through Dubai airport (very large airport and some of us had ailments) no transport arranged. When we reached the departure gate the staff there told us ""its too late for you to get on we did tell arrivals this!"" We were then directed from desk to desk to make arrangements for another flight five desks in all we were sent too in all corners of Dubai airport. We managed to book flights later in the day and they offered us their hotel to shower etc. This meant another group around Dubai airport to get back through customs and to find the bus. We asked if we could just use the airport lounge due to the people suffering from all the walking and we were told ""you cannot use the lounge that is for business and first class only"". By the time we reached the hotel we just had time to shower eat a late breakfast and back to the airport to go through customs and immigration again. Emirates could not have made us feel any worse with there attitude and behaviour. Our advise to you if you are travelling economy is to go for another airline we have traveled on China Eastern and found the service much better than Emirates provide.",Detractor

Flying Perth to Manchester for a funeral both out and return flights delayed therefore missed connecting flights on each trip (facing an extra 10 hours on the return leg). On arrival at Dubai no one met the passengers to offer directions to desks etc and on asking to use the lounge to send an email was met with a 'no' - not every one has a fancy phone with internet service! Hotel voucher led to a hotel room for a 'sleep' of approx 3hrs not worth the effort. For the cost of the ticket was not impressed with the lack of ground service or apologies for such a long delay one would think they would be more organised as this must happen regularly.,Detractor
Flight EK148 AMS-DXB on 7/2/2015 in business class. Boarding in AMS was a joke. The economy class pax blocked the way to the gate exit to the aircraft. The ground staff did nothing here when boarding for the first and business class passengers began. Chaos was the word that came to my mind. About 20 minutes delay on departure. Food was of poor quality. The inflight service no better than any other 4-star airline. The seats are acceptable and provide ample space. We were transported by bus to the terminal upon arrival in Dubai. This took about 20 minutes. Another 20 minutes walk to the to the train for transport to the next terminal and another 15 minutes to get to the lounge. What happened to their so-called famous A380 terminal where all A380 aircraft can be handeld. Lounge was OK. Flight EK384 DXB-BKK on 8/2/2015 in business class. No exciting flight. What you can expected for the price you paid for business class. Food was mediocre. FA were friendly and gave good service. Flight EK385 BKK-DXB on 19/2/2015. Again an uneventful flight with food less than mediocre. FA's acceptable. Flight EK147 DXB-AMS. The best of the four legs. FA omnipresent and very friendly. Food was good.

My husband and have just returned from our holiday to Sri-Lanka and Dubai. We used Emirates on all four flights. We were very happy with Emirates except for our return flight home from Dubai. The service was not what we had previously experienced with the airline. We were some while into our flight when our first meal arrived clearly there was some delay with this meal as our next meal arrived within approximately an hour. It all seemed a little chaotic. We appreciate that the cabin crew worked hard and were very busy throughout the flight however during the other three flights in a two week period the service was excellent. We have flown with Emirates before and have received very good service so we're disappointed.,Passive
Flew Manchester-Dubai-Singapore and returned three weeks later. Going out OK but remember much longer journey than with other airlines you also have to change planes. Service in past has made this acceptable not any more will I be doing it. Earphones were not working so entertainment not good going out on one half of outward journey. Return journey was a nightmare. Plane full and a seat in front that came so far back I had trouble opening my tray. The guy in front watched movies all the way but was not concerned that I had no room. Monitor did not work for three hours so they reset it three times before it worked. Seatbelt was falling apart. Toilet had no water in sink after putting soap on hands. Water dispenser also was not working. Second meal before landing not served. I was already unhappy from first leg. Second flight was from the other side of the airport a good thirty minutes dash never had such a distance on such a tiring journey. Dubai to Manchester now another eight hours if you are lucky. Problems with a forty ton machine being loaded in cargo hold falls off pallets and jams luggage hold. We sit in our seats for two hours waiting to take off. We eventually do set off. Leave aircraft and immediately complain on website. No answer as yet. I have travelled with Emirates over the years many times I will not be doing so again service is no longer there.,Detractor
Flew from Birmingham UK to Dubai on 27th January and did not enjoy the experience. Cabin crew were terrible. Half the plane received a hot towel before takeoff and then the crew could not be bothered with the rest of us and abandoned it. Dinner service was dreadful. The rows behind us received their food about an hour before we did but then they had to sit with their food trays for about another 2 hours before being cleared away. It was 3 hours in before we received our first drink. Finally the menu said we would get a hot drink and sweet treat before landing - nothing given. The crew were so slow it was unbelievable. Flew back from Singapore yesterday via Dubai and could not believe this was the same airline. Yes we all got given hot towels and again before landing. Very prompt with food and drinks and was a pleasure to fly with them this time.,Passive
"Business class on EK 418 BKK-SYD. The flight itself on a 777 was good and my wife and I managed to get a decent rest on the angled seats. Had a very enthusiastic crew serving us with a smile. Dinner was well presented. We missed breakfast as we were asleep. Departure and arrival on time. Aircraft equipped with older ICE but not a problem on this medium haul night flight. Main negatives at check-in and upon arrival. I was very surprised that our reserved seats (9 K and J) were no longer assigned to us even though booked more than 6 months in advance. I am platinum with QF (code share on this flight) so got a bit upset as the check-in staff at the first class check- in in BKK tried to put us in to the middle row of three with one aisle and one middle seat. After rejecting this seat change lady suddenly ""found"" seats 10 K and J for us. Could not work out why our initially reserved seats were no longer available (managed to look at the boarding passes of both passengers sitting in 9 K & J and they had no status with EK or QF). Second negative aspect of the trip during luggage collection at SYD. Even though our 2 suitcases were both properly labeled with ""First"" labels and we checked-in at BKK 2.5 hours prior to departure our suitcases appeared as one of the last items on the belt in Sydney. As I said to my wife first economy passengers of our flight were already checking in to their hotels in Sydney while we were still waiting for our baggage. An overall great flight but check-in at BKK and luggage return in SYD needs to be improved. Also not impressed with the EK Lounge in BKK. Looks new and cozy with good food and drink on offer but the chairs are very uncomfortable.",Passive
I flew SIN-DXB-BHX after spending New Year in Singapore. I cannot believe that the standards have gone down so badly. I have been flying EK since 2006. Transit in Dubai - Dubai airport can be a huge one and boast of passenger numbers but the reality is that it is finding hard to cater to the growth. Terminal 3 is supposed to be exclusive for EK but why no aerobridges provided. My flight departed SIN at 01.20 landed at around 05.00 in DXB. EK parked their B777-300ER somewhere at the far end of the airport and we were made to climb down the staircase at that time. We were packed in a bus and sent to the terminal which took some 15 to 20 min. I entered the terminal at around 5.45am and walked down for security check. Finally at around 6.30am I reached my gate B30. After the boarding pass check guess what we are asked to board a bus again for a 15 min ride to the far end of the airport where they have parked their B777-300ER again. There was no proper organised zonal boarding as everyone just boarded the flight through the rear door and had to queue a lot before taking the seats inside the flight. Inflight Service - The inflight service was awful. The standards have down in this area since 2010. Their food portions have gone down I always felt hungry after the meal! Cabin crew don't want to move from their seats at all! If you want something it is always better to go to the galley rather than wait for anyone.,Detractor
LHR-DXB-BKK-DXB-LHR. Four flights in a A380s in a week. Service was slick and professional but there were signs of cost-cutting. Some of the meals were excellent and other mediocre. Boarding the flights was a relatively anarchic process. There were two specific problems that were drawn to my attention by the cabin crew. The first is that many of the business passengers had apparently been upgraded from economy because Emirates had overbooked the flight. This meant that the cabin crew upstairs were working extremely hard and were perhaps not quite as happy as they normally are. The second was the build quality of the A380. For instance two of the four bathroom doors at the rear of business were faulty on a relatively new aircraft (A6-EEN) and according to the cabin crew there were quite a few other similar issues. This is of course not necessarily the fault of Emirates but quite a lot of passengers seem irritated when the light failed to come on it one of the bathrooms and the door failed to shut in another. It never ceases to amaze me that having been building bathrooms in aircraft for many decades manufacturers still haven't managed to work out how to design cup dispensers that allow you to take one cup at a time or tissue dispensers the release a single tissue rather than a handful. That said the cabin crew were assiduous on all of the flights in keeping the bathrooms clean. The flatbed seat was extremely comfortable especially with a mattress although sitting towards the rear of the aircraft meant that there was a constant matter of closing doors from the galley. The OnAir Internet works fine for the LHR-DXB leg and enables you to download your emails (assuming no large attachments) for free because it starts charging at 10MB and even then is not overpriced. However on the return leg it did not appear to work at all. GSM also worked at the cabin crew reminded passengers to keep their phones on silent to avoid disturbing people.,Passive
I flew from Muscat to Geneva via Dubai with my 3 children. We were overall very disappointed with the quality of the service and the staff attitude onboard. Air hostesses were rude staff made us wait for our hot meals as we refused a menu we had not requested on the way back special meals were not edible!

EK412 and return on EK413 Sydney - Auckland return. A380 in business. As usual lounges both ends were luxurious spacious and comfortable. There is no doubt that the window seats on the upper deck are absolutely fantastic. Big screen TV private and comfortable. Outbound to Auckland the service was very slow and I only ate breakfast 20 minutes before descent. On the return flight no such problems. The bar is a nice touch and usable unlike similar products on 777's. The quietness of the 380 is unbelievable especially for travellers like me that cut there teeth on DC8's and 707's.,Promoter
"BKK-SYD on a 777-300ER. Emirates will always score points when I travel on their A380s and 77Ws. The IFE is brilliant and the food and beverage service is excellent for an economy class product. This flight was let down a little by the crew. They clearly did not get on well with one another and for some this carried over to their dealings with passengers. The PA announcements also seemed overdone with little thought to the timing of some especially when being delivered in three languages. I found the boarding process interesting. Row numbers were called in increments of 5 logically starting from the back. There appeared to be an insistence that the entire gate area was scoured for every last passenger within the designated rows before the next 5 rows were called. I have never seen a 777 boarded so slowly resulting in a 20 minute delay. It looked like the ""rules"" were getting in the way of reasonableness and that overly technical atmosphere summed up the flight. This flight was QF- ticketed and my outbound journey was with QF. I rated them the same overall but for different reasons. Emirates has the hard product in its grasp but I preferred the QF flight for its reassuring professionalism.",Promoter

In December I flew from Zurich to Dubai. I was excited to fly the A380. However my excitement quickly turned into disappointment after experiencing the absolute crankiness of the cabin crew. Although never really rude the flight stewardesses were all very short and only busy with themselves. Their body language and facial expressions were often as if they'd rather be somewhere else and as if were a constant nuisance. The A380 (AMS-DUB) itself is a very nice plane spacious and modern. The onboard entertainment was pretty good and the extra touch were the cameras outside the plane so you could watch the outside surroundings from your screen in front of you. The return trip with a 777 was also disappointing. Emirates could not seat us together on the 6 hrs flight despite that we booked under the same booking reference number. Will never fly with them again unless I have no other option.,Detractor
BKK-SYD on a Qantas codeshare flying Emirates 22/1/2015 arriving SYD 23/1/2015. The service was great. The food delicious. Ample reading material and the ICE entertainment provided more than enough distraction but the seat was too narrow and uncomfortable and the overall ambience felt cramped.,Promoter
"Last October I flew from Amsterdam to Jakarta through Dubai. I was excited to fly the A380. However my excitement quickly turned into disappointment after experiencing the absolute crankiness of the cabin crew. Although never really rude the flight stewardesses were pretty much all very short almost 'bitchy' and only busy with themselves. Their body language and facial expressions were often as if they'd rather be somewhere else and as if were a constant nuisance. The A380 (AMS-DUB) itself is a very nice plane spacious and modern. The onboard entertainment was pretty good and the extra touch were the cameras outside the plane so you could watch the outside surroundings from your screen in front of you. Between Dubai and Jakarta they use a Boeing 777. Another disappointment! The plane on the inside was old seats smelled and looked like they definitely could use new fabrics. The entertainment screen was small and old (my 3 year old tablet has a better screen than that onboard the 777 of Emirates) supposedly touch screen it worked horribly even with the remote control device. Different plane and different crew but not a different mentality of the crew. From Jakarta to Dubai we flew again with the 777. Same complaints as on the way to Jakarta and on top of that when we arrived 5am in Dubai we had to get out of the plane far from the terminal building. We had to use stairs to get out and clearly the stairs weren't designed to handle such a large plane since there was quite the difference in height between the stairs and the exit door of the plane. When I asked the crew why we didn't taxi to the terminal the reply was ""there is no available gate"". This is the home base of Emirates and there is no place for its own planes? From the runway we had to take a shuttle bus to the terminal which took about 20 to 30 minutes. From there it was very confusing where to go once inside the terminal building. For my girlfriend and I this was the first and last time we used Emirates.",Passive
We flew A380 to Dubai then 777 to Bangkok. Both flights on time. Loved the A380 it was so spacious we sat in row 88 at the back. The A380 was really quiet too. The 777 felt more cramped and was not as comfy. The IFE is brilliant both touch screens. Finally the food. We fly long haul twice a year but the Emirates food is by far the best we have had. Can't wait to fly with them again.,Promoter
RUH-DXB-MRU and back. Aug 15 RUH-DXB left Riyadh on time at 9.25 pm on a 777-300 ER. Service was excellent and the staff were kind! There were a few food choices (it was a short 1.5 hr flight) and I think it was Chicken Biriani or Fish. I had the Biriani and it was excellent (but spicy!). The IFE was very good and kept me entertained. We arrived to Dubai and they gave us fast track cards but we didn't need that since we were transiting in DXB for about 3 hrs. DXB was very busy and noisy. Arrived to the lounge and it was packed with barely anywhere to sit! Finally found a place near the buffet but it was pretty noisy. Our flight to MRU left at 3.10am (on the 16th and again on time so EK are pretty good at being on schedule) on an A380. It was a pretty nice plane but I had a few problems with the cabin and seat. The mini bar on the left (or right depends on where you're sitting) of the seat is pretty bulky and makes the seat more narrow and quite uncomfortable to sleep as it's quite tight (but it was a flat bed so I'll give it points for that). Another problem was that the cabin for Business was huge! It barely felt like Business from the amount of seats in the cabin! I sat in the smaller cabin on the back so I didn't have the problem that much and it didn't affect the service of the staff but it makes Business less premium. Once again the IFE and food service were excellent. For the lounge in the back of the deck I really enjoyed that! On the return flight I left MRU in the evening so I didn't have to sleep on that flight (and it was pretty much the same thing but the cabin was much busier). I didn't go to the lounge in the DXB layover since it was from 12.00 am to about 7:00 am and I took a room in the airport hotel. The DXB-RUH flight was normal but the IFE was more outdated. I would say it was pretty good but there were a few flaws with the A380.,Promoter
Series of Trips on EK MEL-CMB-MEL and CMB-CAI-CMB. All sectors in Business except DXB-CMB which was in First. Check in Good. Lounges not bad. However the quality of food in DXB has been going down over time. Good Welcome on Boarding. IFE is AVOD and excellent as always. Staff can be hit or miss mostly a miss. The quality of meals on board keeps going down every month. Bread basket is brought around only when you are nearly done with the main. Of all the sectors I flew the food on EK 650 First Class from DXB to CMB was the worst. The curry sauce which accompanied the rice tasted like chillies mixed with water. Depending on how much you pay for ticket it is still value for money. But EK is on a steep downward spiral. And if you have any comments or complains post flight and write to their customer service desk do not be surprise if you get a watered down response which is a border line insult.,Passive
LHR-DXB-BKK Economy. Check-in pretty efficient in T3. The flight was full (as usual) with Emirates and left on time. The A380 is much quieter than the 777 but there's not much difference in the seats/space. Cabin service on Emirates is variable depending on the crew and this one was OK - nothing special. Economy food has improved recently and quite tasty. Good choice of drinks and frequent water/juice runs. On time into DXB and A380's park at the gate instead of remote stands which makes connections easier. I got upgraded to Business on the DXB-BKK leg again an A380 which was about 30mins late. The best part of Business on Emirates is a priority pass for immigration in BKK. The cabin service in Business was nothing special and I prefer to eat in the lounge rather than on the flight. Good IFE - there's always something worth watching on Emirates.,Promoter
The flight from Hamburg to Dubai was two hours delayed and service on board started 25 hours after take-off. I pushed the service button in order to receive some water for taking medicine the only thing that happened was that after ten minutes a Stewardess came by switched of the service sign and went away. I pushed the button a second time and the same happened again. Furthermore there was only once service on an 8 hours flight. Food unfortunately below standard. The Entertainment System was quite ok though. Hope that I don't have to fly with Emirates again.,Detractor
FRA-DXB-BKK-DXB-FRA. Must take EK again for the flight to Bangkok due to the best price base on 6 months advance booking. FRA-DXB on A380 nice aircraft-flight full but still roomy DXB-BKK on B777 did not get the selected seats (even those seats are selected 6 months in advance by the time of booking on EK Tool) EK has changed our seats and we did not sit together/flight full - no more to say about the 3-4-3 seating. Worst service of all sectors slow service we requested water but were told to wait for the next service. BKK-DXB-FRA on A380/B777 flight full our choice of foods ran out on every sector. I've flown Emirates over a period of six years and I can definitively say that every time I fly the service is getting worse. Its route networks and frequencies are very good and its fares (if booking at least 3 months in advance) can be competitive. However EK progressively gets worse. EK is still on cutting back massively on quality example no amenity kits for Y class foods (quality and quantity) is getting worse cutting the Skywards-mileage counts too small number of cabin crews in Y cabin and they are disinterested in passenger service avoid service to passengers disregards the calling sign. Very chaotic and very slow on board-services choice of foods ran out very early no organization. All those bad on board services EK fare is no more valuable for money. Only IFE is the best.,Detractor
DXB - IAD [Washington DC] in January 2015 economy class. Given the only choice on this direct route is either Emirates or United it's not really much in the way of competition - give me Emirates every time. Emirates has an excellent on-demand in-flight entertainment system decent food efficient multi-lingual staff amenity packs in economy on long-haul flights and all drinks except champagne are complementary in economy. No one really wants to be stuck on a plane for 15 hours but it's on these really long routes that the little extras on Emirates - especially the in-flight entertainment system and power outlets for every seat - come into their own.,Promoter

We flew in August 2014 from Rio de Janeiro - Dubai and Dubai to Shanghai. We travelled with 2 children (3 months and 26 months). On our first flight the toddlers TV was broken so he used my husbands and mine couldn't be used as we had the bassinet for our baby. Staff were friendly though. One our second flight my seat didn't recline I was promised at the start of the flight that they could manually do it after the meal was served so I thought that was reasonable after the meal however they told me it couldn't be done I would just have to accept it. So for an 8 hour flight I sat upright with a baby on my lap as he wasn't allowed to use the bassinet most of the time because of turbulence. However our toddler slept in his aviation approved car seat that their telephone service agents said we couldn't use. I think their customer service needs improving they tried to tell me I needed to buy 2 seats to use one car seat for a toddler whose seat I had already purchased. However at the airport everything was ok due to a nice customer agent who was able to place all our family together when again customer service had placed us all separately. The airline didn't live up to the expectation that we had and we fly long haul several times per year.,Passive
Flew from DXB-KUL. Flight was onboard B777-300ER. Everything from boarding until touch-down was excellent.

Flew on their B777-300ER for a short trip to DMM. Aircraft was far more comfortable than the older 777-300s. IFE was pretty much best in class however I did not find their meals particularly great. Decent airline overall but definitely slightly over hyped.,Promoter
We were a party of eight travelling to Male via Dubai on the 20 December 2014 for two magical weeks in the Maldives. Going out had a 3hr stopover in Dubai which was changed to 3hr 40 minutes Our return flight times were good leaving Dubai at 2.35pm. 5 week before we were due to travel we were advised Emirates had changed their flight schedule meaning our flight from Male did not leave enough time to transfer the luggage from one flight to another. The only option we were given was a 12.5 hr delay or return a day early from our holiday We ended up using Dubai connect which was not good experience. We paid quite a bit more to go with Emirates than another leading airline. Never again.,Passive
LHR-DXB-PER-DXB-LHR. The trip out to Perth was almost a tale of two different airlines. LHR-DXB on the A380. The Heathrow lounge is dull and there was little sign of staff. It was not made clear that boarding would be straight from the lounge. Once on board a welcome drink was proposed but never arrived. No amenities kit was offered. The plastic bags they put the headphones etc in look cheap and nasty. The much-vaunted wireless IFE controller would not unlock from its dock so not much use. 3 different cabin staff said they would deal with it but nothing was achieved. Meal service was unduly slow. No drinks served (as promised) before the end of the flight. The promised Dubai gate information on IFE channel 94 didn't materialise. Yes it was business class but it was all very impersonal and irritating. The toilets are just by the bar area so if you are queuing you are mixed up with the bar clients - not a comfortable arrangement. DXB-PER on a B777 was totally different: perfect service and everything worked. PER-DXB the seatbelt adjuster didn't work and couldn't be fixed and they eventually cobbled something together with an extender - a bit embarrassing to be presented with that in front of other passengers. Again the IFE controller didn't work. We got to the Dubai area on schedule then had to hold for 40 minutes due to congestion. When we landed we were parked at a (very) remote stand which meant a long bus ride to the terminal. Terminal 3 is enormous and impersonal and there was no time left to do any duty free shopping. DXB-LHR was ok. The IFE controller didn't work - again! So all in all I'm not that satisfied with Emirates. There seems to be a lack of attention to detail. I've flown LHR-PER once a year for the past 10 years and have used Qantas Singapore Malaysian and Qatar all in business class. I'd rank Emirates at the bottom of this list. It'll be back to Qatar next year.,Passive
Whilst I noticed the narrower seating (Being 777) on my way to London (Emirates) I was lucky then to have a corner seat right in the area which is usually reserved for parents with small children. But yesterday I arrived back in Perth from Dubai on an 11-hour flight on the same Boeing 777-300ER and my coccyx and lower back are still aching from the narrow seating. I can only say I am going to carefully consider my next flight maybe even save up for 2nd class. Cattle class is just that I am not obese but have wide hips and shoulders and I am above average height. The seats on the Boeing 777-300ER were a good 2.5 inches narrower than on the remainder of my particular flight ( Dubai London) legroom is less and the back can only be minimally adjusted. Sleep is impossible. Service was very average crew seemed to be permanently engaged in jockeying their unwieldy carts in that narrower passage-ways food options ran out quickly. The entertainment options do not make up for the unpleasantness of the entire experience. Of course comfort is supplied to the higher-paying customers. I really do resent this! Will try and check out the plane-type before flying again.,Passive
This was my first time with Emirates and did not find it worth all the hype and pricey tickets. Traveled on an A380 on 3 legs of our trip and seat size + legroom was not very comfortable for a 14 hour flight. There is hardly any space to stretch or walk around a bit on the flight. Staff was courteous and polite however service wasn't quick enough but I think that's just due to the number of passengers on the flight. At one point it took them more than an hour to collect our plates after we finished our meal. Food was okay nothing great or exceptional. In- flight entertainment was the only best part about the flight screen is great plus they have a good collection of movies etc.,Passive
DFW-DXB-BOM: Booked Emirates as it was the cheapest and got a very good deal. The aircraft from Dallas was A380 which cannot be doubted on its comfort. I requested an exit row seat and got it. Food was very good and tasty from Dallas to Dubai. However cabin crew didn't respond for long on 2 occasions I called through my seat button. Service from Dubai to Mumbai was okayish nothing great to talk about. Old Boeing 777-300 which was stinking. I think Emirates doesn't focus properly on one of its major markets India with respect to quality and service. Overall I would give 3.5 stars to Emirates. 4 for DFW-DXB leg and 3 for DXB-BOM leg. I got value for money since I got a very low fare.,Promoter

Returned from Dubai to Newcastle on the 23rd November 2014. Our inflight entertainment system did not work. The staff tried resetting it but this did not cure the problem. Eventually I was offered another seat which I declined as we were travelling as a couple I did not wish to move without my husband. When the hot meal was served we choose the chicken which was cold. Mentioned this to the staff who offered another meal but declined this. Beware they have got too big to care.,Detractor
DUB-DXB-DEL. The flight from Dublin was delayed which meant I was a bit worried about my connecting flight from Dubai as I only had about 2 hours transit but transit was pretty smooth. I had a positive experience with the security staff at Dubai airport - the guy who checked me was polite and smiled. Compared to Doha airport Dubai seemed a lot better organized. This was my first time transiting through Dubai and I was impressed. The food on both flights was decent without being outstanding. For vegetarians Air India and Jet Airways definitely offer a superior product. The staff on the Delhi flight neglected to distribute immigration forms which meant that the foreigners on the flight had to try and find forms at Delhi airport which was hard as they seemed to have run out. A helpful passenger had an extra form and I was saved. Overall I would say the flight was okay without being anything special - about the same as Qatar Airways.,Passive
Great legroom even when the passenger in front reclines back. Cabin crew were friendly. Food was okay. Emirates has the widest inflight entertainment.

I flew from Dubai to Mumbai on EK502 on 1st Jan 2015. I had a confirmed internet check in with seat numbers allocated. When I arrived at the counter I was told that they were over booked and I had to defer my flight. They informed me that the confirmed check in was not valid till a boarding pass was issued. I had to wait until the boarding time before they called me and offered a seat right at the back of the plane and not the one I reserved at time of online check in. Looks like they don't honor their online check in system.,Detractor
A380 Dubai - Melbourne. Seated in exit row 52 although some kind of fridge malfunction had soaked the floor so we had to use blankets in order not to get wet - it being a full flight and already in exit row wasn't really going to give it up. Food was slightly disappointing - still perfectly edible but nothing special. IFE was great for TV loads of series but fewer movies. Inflight WIFI is a nice touch although it took me 10 hours to log on. I sent them a complaint email about the wet floor during the flight which I think is pretty good. Overall - the Qantas-Emirates tie up is great for Europe to Australia especially with the overnight timings of the flights and A380's going all directions. Emirates also a solid choice for service.,Passive
I flew twice with Emirates in December - Bangkok-Dubai-Gatwick returning Heathrow-Dubai-Bangkok then again Bangkok-Dubai-Istanbul and return. Their inflight entertainment options are above average although their headsets were broken 50% of the time. Other than this I am sad to say on both flights I was disappointed with all aspects of their service. Our group were always split in the most odd fashion - even on our business class flight I was separated several rows apart which made no sense. Food options ran out on one flight - chicken or lamb my parents cannot eat lamb but they ran out of chicken - no alternative or other option! We were no where near the back row so obviously many other passengers only had lamb as an option! There are far better options out there for similar prices or cheaper. Don't make the mistake I made - don't fly Emirates if you have other options.,Detractor
MXP-DXB-BKK-DXB in Business. As usual I found the biz product to be excellent both on A380 and on B773. VIP lounge in Milan is brand new with plenty of seats and amenities with direct separate boarding directly from the lounge. Once on board seats are very comfortable high quality food and drinks smiles and kindness from all the crew. The only weakness is concerning boarding procedures at Bangkok that don't allow priority at all once pre-boarded is all chaotic so you have to literally walk over economy class passengers. EK is one of the most comfortable J class in the market I'll fly with them again.,Promoter

Flew HAM-DXB-BLR and returned BLR-DXB-HAM in mid-December 2014 with Emirates. Before taking this flight I'd heard the hype about Emirates being one of the best airlines so was looking forward to the trip. How far could the reality be from the hype? A long way. Where to begin? The seats are not comfortable stewardesses missed me twice when bringing drinks around and once when bringing meals (I wasn't asleep they just didn't ask and were looking away from me so I couldn't get their attention until I had to practically shout at them - which got an angry- looking glare). On the return leg from BLR to DXB I got a nosebleed in flight and wanted to ask them for tissues - I used the call button but nobody came. Waited several minutes then tried again this went on until the bleeping stopped after about 15 minutes. Not one attendant came to repeated buzzing over that time. Finally it stopped and I got out of my window seat and to the toilet to take care of it myself. I noticed during the flights to BLR and on the return that there were plenty of other people who also got no responses to their calls - they finally gave up or I saw a couple of them get up from their seats and find an attendant themselves - so ignoring passengers seems to be corporate policy. Meals are also average. All-in-all not a good experience over 4 flights with this airline - I would not recommend flying with them - I sure won't if I can avoid it.,Detractor
LGW-DXB-SIN. Plane 2 hours late leaving LGW due to late inbound arrival. Fog at DXB extended delay to 3 hours including an abortive attempt at landing. Landed 03.15 exactly the time onward flight to SIN should have been taking off. That flight had closed so missed connection. Incredibly difficult to get rebooked. Long queues at transfer desk. Staff did not have ability to make re bookings directly but had to call their reservations department somewhere else in airport. Long long waits to get a response (half hour plus for each passenger) and no queuing system on their telephones. No offer to arrange hotels even though some passengers clearly becoming distressed at length of queuing time. To cap it all I later found that my connection was still on the ground when I arrived in DXB and did not leave for another 2 hours even though shown as flight closed i.e.they had allocated my paid for and checked in seat to someone else!,Detractor
My journey from Bangkok to London Gatwick return was the best journey I have had. On all sectors LGW-DXB-BKK and BKK-DXB-LGW I had a pleasant flight. Flight crew were extremely helpful smiling all the time food and drinks were served on time and food was surprisingly tasty. Fleet that served us on different legs of the journey were as following LGW-DXB was on B777-300ER DXB-BKK was on A380-800 BKK â€“DXB was on A380-800 DXB-LGW was on B777-300ER. Seating arrangements on both Emirates B777-300ER and A380-800 is 3-4-3 I have always considered these seating arrangements to be very cramped. Surprisingly Emirates somehow made it feel specious with plenty of leg room. Entertainment on board both B777-300ER and A380-800 was wonderful with over 1000 channels of entertainment to choose from flying cannot get boring. If you do manage to get bored then many of the Emirates B777 and A380 are fitted with inflight WIFI internet OnAir at a very reasonable price. I paid Â£0.63 for 600mb that's enough to last me on all my sectors. Overall I enjoyed everything Emirates had to offer staff were very helpful on board and on ground. Services offered on board were more than I expected. Entertainment food and drinks on board were by the best I have had so far on an aeroplane. I would definitely recommend flying with Emirates if you haven't flown before.,Promoter

Just flew PER-DXB-FRA. We found the overall experience to be disappointing and don't understand all the hype about Emirates being one of the best. The seats were narrow and hard which made them very uncomfortable for long flights. Qantas has way better seats. The food was average nothing to note at all. The biggest disappointment was with the unfriendly soulless cabin crew on both flights. Barely a smile out of any of them. They looked like they were dead walking just going through the motions of their jobs. One in fact entertained us by digging around for ear wax a few times and then flicking into the aisle. She was gross! Not at all what we were expecting. Maybe our return flights will be better?,Detractor
We flew to Istanbul via Dubai on the 01/12/2014 and back on 10/12/2014.

We had a 10 hours stay over at Dubai to Istanbul and a 12 hours over stay from Istanbul at Dubai. No where we was informed regarding the hotel vouchers-I am sure that I do not have to explain how tired we were. The staff when we bought our tickets should have notified us regarding this.

KUL-MEL-KUL. The outbound flight to MEL was perfect and in-flight service was top notch. However the inbound flight to KUL was less than ideal. There was at least a 75 minute delay out of MEL. I think this is to do with day-light saving time (1hr) in MEL plus a bit more. I think it is the airlines responsibility to adjust and advertise the correct departure times in cases such as this. I was not informed when I checked in over the web or the counter staff at the baggage drop. However given the price out of KL I would fly this airline again.,Promoter
My Husband and I travelled on Emirates on DEL-DXB-NCE-CDG-DXB-DEL between 8th and 16th December and were disappointed with the service that the airline offered. The DEL-DXB and DXB-DEL flights were the most horrible that I have encountered so far. The staff was extremely rude and unhelpful. On our DEL-DXB flight I requested for water thrice but it never came and on my third request I was rudely told by the staff that she can't give me water as she had other priorities to take care of. It was a clear sign that Emirates is not interested in taking care of its flyers. Our flight from CDG-DXB was also not great as the supply of water and juices was intermittent. However I have high regards for the crew flying on DXB-NCE flight on the morning of 8th December. They were courteous helpful and very prompt in their service. They made our journey special with a small pastry when they got to know that we were newlyweds. But this was plain luck as the rest three legs of the journey were very disappointing and we have decided not to fly Emirates again. The attitude of the staff clearly showed that passengers should not expect after sales service once they have paid for their tickets.,Detractor
I flew Business Class Dubai to Casablanca return (777-300) and Dubai to Addis Ababa return (A330-200) last month. All flights were on time cabin crew and service excellent meals pretty good. I really couldn't fault them. The angled lay flat seat on the 777-300 is comfy and I never fully recline it to flat - I find it much more comfortable to put it into a kind of almost lying down lazy boy chair so both ends raised slightly off flat. While I've read many poor reviews on the Business class seats in the A330-200 I have to say I found it very comfy. It definitely doesn't stack up against their long haul A380 seats or even the 777-300 but I was very comfortable with the deep recline great footrests ( so much room) and comfy leather seats. These aircraft's are usually only used on their shorter flights and in this situation I have no problems.,Promoter
EK204-EK304 JFK-DXB-PVG. We are skywards members. Departure time is 12:05AM Delayed for about 4 hours. We would not make our connection flight to Shanghai. The staff in New York only gave us one choice which was fly to Hong Kong from Dubai then transfer the flight back to Shanghai in Hong Kong. We asked them for next flight from Dubai to Shanghai but they said that they can not find the tickets in their system. The A380 from JFK to DXB is ok. Entertainment is the best of all airlines. The seat for A380 have more legroom than the 777. Food is fantastic. Three meals served. You can order beverages or snacks any time on board. I still recommend Emirates.,Passive
DUB-DXB 773 fantastic. New high quality equipment with great attention to detail from very professional staff. Connection to BKK flight in DXB international was a disgrace. Was looking forward to flying the A380 but experience was just not the same 20% of the staff did very little while the others were extremely busy on a very full flight. Conclusion other airlines should take note.,Promoter
LHR-DBX-SIN A380. Emirates A380 is a brilliant product. I flew economy - and it was arguably the best cabin experience. Spacious great inflight entertainment comfortable seat amazingly lit cabin at night and great food. It was really difficult to fault. The staff were friendly and helpful got some great sleep on the flight too - and there's really not much else to say! Would highly recommend.,Promoter
Check in staff at Gatwick were first class and helpful. Boarding was late but no idea why. On the flight the seats were comfortable and meal ok. Staff were not very forthcoming with service! Drinks not offered had to ask for them and was left waiting for over 30 mins holding used cups as no one answered my call bell. On return from Dubai check in staff not very helpful onboard staff - same problem. Slow to answer call bell seats not very comfortable and no drinks offered except with meal. Breakfast omelette was cold and so was the tea. This certainly wasn't up to the standard I was expecting from Emirates given their reputation of being a first class airline.,Detractor
EK 57 DXB to DUS Boeing 777-300 with the older ICE AVOD but still enough. Plane was on time both departing and arriving. Food and Beverages service was great. Ice cream was served as well. The crew was fantastic and very friendly they did a great job. Bags on belt took almost 45 minutes but that is a typical DUS Airport problem. Legroom was great again better than other airlines in Europe.,Promoter
BKK-Istanbul-Johannesburg. The A380 BKK-Dubai leg was very comfortable the widebody offered plenty of room to stretch out. The B777 on the Dubai-JNB leg was dated and the IFE screen did not work properly on the JNB-Dubai leg. The service offered by the cabin crew on all flights was excellent. The entertainment system (ICE) is the best I've experienced. The only thing that they need to improve on is the meal portion size.,Passive
We flew from LGW to DXB (777-300) stopped in DXB for 3 days and flew onwards from DXB to BNE (A380) as we'd heard good reviews of Emirates and wanted to see a little of UAE. Emirates offered the best price and connections to/from Australia and New Zealand. Really disappointing LGW to DXB service - staff were rude had no personality and seemed rushed. Food was average and entertainment not much better. We left the flight in DXB more than willing to give them a second chance to impress on the longer DXB-BNE sector (14hrs on the A380) but more of the same. Staff were rude unfriendly seemed rushed to complete service more concerned with doing their make-up (we were sat next to the galley) than much else. Really poor. We're flying back CHC-SYD-BKK-DXB-LGW and to say that we're looking forward to it would be misleading. Compared to other long-haul flights we've flown (Air NZ Virgin Atlantic Singapore BA) Emirates are by far and away the worst - unless it seems you are lucky to be a Gold member when they can't do enough for you.,Detractor
CPT-DXB-LHR. Appalling start in the Bidvest 'Premier' lounge at CPT stuffed to the gills and poor quality food and drink. FAs friendly enough on 777-300ER but dinner service slow and the 2-3-2 seats lacked privacy for a night-time flight. 4 hr stopover at DXB fine once the gate for A380 flight to LHR had been identified - no thanks to a discourteous DXB employee. A380 impressively quiet as ever and a pair of E/F seats were excellent for a couple. Lunch service again slow and the main courses inedible. Flight deck poor at updating on flight including bad turbulence. Quick disembarkation and speedy baggage reclaim.,Passive
"Not sure why Qantas decided to partner with Emirates - terrible deal for Qantas customers! Travelling from Dubai to New York on the A380 I bought paid for the WiFi access and used it for about 5 minutes before it went off. When I complained to the onboard service director she told me that Emirates was not responsible for the service and that I needed to write to ""inner"" the service provider. This was absolutely shocking - in my opinion Emirates is responsible for every service offered on it's flights. Also flying from LHR to Dubai on a night flight my seat was damaged and wouldn't recline so having paid for a first class seat I was unable to get a nights rest (the aircrew told me that they knew the seat was damaged before the flight left but that the engineer was unable to fix it). The flight was full so I was unable to be relocated but I would have preferred to have been given the choice of another flight - this is what Qantas would have done. Put simply I believe that Emirates have placed far too much emphasis on growth and not enough on keeping customers happy. Given the available alternatives and the cost of air tickets I for one will not be flying Emirates anymore.",Detractor
EK 772 CPT to DXB. Flight was on a Boeing 777-300. Boarding was on time and it was fast. Take off about 30 minutes late but even with almost 30 minutes holding time in DXB plane was still on time or schedule. Crew was nice and food choices was matched. I even got a second hot meal as I was still hungry. Bags were on belt when we arrived there. Only downturn was that the full plane got a remote stand and we had to take the bus to the terminal which took almost another 30 minutes. Would fly EK again since the legroom was great in economy.,Promoter
Glasgow to Male via Dubai and return economy class. All flights on time with Emirates' usual professionalism and efficiency in dealing with quick transfers of baggage between flights.

Friendly and responsive staff on all flights.,Promoter
Vienna-Dubai-Manila and return in Business all on B777. Emirates is decent 4-star airline. The night flight out of Vienna was as one would expect - quick dinner service (good meal but nothing special) friendly staff (always addressed me with my name) but seats are far too narrow for business class because Emirates squeezes a middle seat into the centre row. On arrival in Dubai we were bussed to the gate (out of 4 arrivals/take-offs 3 were from bus gates and the bus ride takes quite a while). The business lounge was a disappointment. It is fairly large as it stretches across almost the whole first floor of the terminal but it is rather narrow and dull it overlooks the shopping concourse below (noise) there are showers but they are tiny. Strangely I had to ask for a non- alcoholic beverage at the bar as only juice and water are freely supplied but all hard drinks are self-serve. The onward flight to Manila was on a noticeably older 777 in a two-class configuration. The staff performance on this flight was outstanding. On the return flight one of only two washrooms for C-class broke which lead to queues. The plane was spotless and new but cabin crew performance was below par. Coats and jackets were handed back some 30 to 40 minutes before landing some pax had to keep them over their knees as the adjoining seat was occupied. Drinks and snacks were taken away all of a sudden without warning due to landing (still some 30 minutes away). Generally I would recommend them although I still prefer Qatar or Turkish when travelling into Asia.,Passive
MAN-DXB-CPT in business class. The chauffeur service on time. The Manchester lounge was one of the best lounges I've ever used. The flight to DXB was the A380 - the business seats and service are very good. We never bothered with the bar at the back but it did look good. The business lounge at DXB was fairly gruesome to be honest. To crowded dirty and quite a let down after Manchester. The flight to CPT was a 777-300ER. The seats and facilities are not a patch on the A380 still much better than economy. The service was better probably due to the fewer business class passengers. The return flight was all 777-300ER on both legs. Again the seats weren't the best but the food and service on all the legs was generally very good. The chauffeur service was excellent. Our bags turned up first both at CPT and MAN. Overall a very positive experience.,Promoter

"SYD to DXB in Business and upgraded to First with Skywards miles from DXB to MCR. Business was OK - Slight problem with hand controls for ICE which couldn't be resolved. Minor inconvenience. Staff were efficient and tried to help. Always enjoy the small bar/lounge at the rear of the plane. Good to stretch legs and meet people. Food was fair though nothing special. Seat is a little narrow when lie flat but infinitely better than economy. First Class Lounge in DXB was disappointing. Apart from table service for eating I think that the Business Lounge is better. In First there is also a large ""Smoking area"" which I was amazed at. It is not enclosed and the awful smell permeates into the eating areas. Would not recommend. Flight to MCR in First was good. Privacy is appreciated and the crew were very attentive when you wanted them. Touched down at MCR and was through Passport Control and baggage recovery in record time. Chauffeur Drive was a nice finishing touch.",Promoter
Boston - Dubai - Mumbai. The long haul 777's economy section is scandalous. It's the equivalent of flying on a cramped domestic airplane for 14 hours. Honestly I have flown many international trips in Economy and never have I been this uncomfortable. In a standard seat it is so narrow that I had to take turns eating with the passenger next to me because neither of us had enough arm room to cut food. There was absolutely no back support in the 'new and improved' economy seats and the 3-4-3 seating is too much for the 777 â€“ so much so that the flight attendants do not even apologize when they hit your seat every time they walk by you in the narrow aisles. On the way from Dubai back to Boston my entertainment touchscreen misregistered every tap meaning that any time I went to pause a movie the system either exited rewound to the beginning or switched to a view of the map. It is clear that Emirates the is flying on a reputation clearly earned before its new-found desire for profit over passenger well being. Like American domestics they will now punish the passenger for the benefit of their bottom line. Unfortunately I will not fly Emirates again if they continue their push for more and more seats in Economy.,Detractor

We have just had four flights with Emirates Gatwick /Dubai/Singapore Beijing/Dubai/Gatwick on all four flights I could not fault the cabin staff they worked very hard frequently coming round with water. The food was typical airline food re-heating an omelette is not a good idea but the warm croissants a nice touch. The seats on the air bus are very comfortable and had plenty of legroom. We had a query before our first flight with regard to seats and customer services were most helpful and resolved the situation. It was a long tiring trip made bearable by Ice the wonderful entertainment system. We were quite happy with our economy flight.,Passive
Flew BKK to SYD - seat was really uncomfortable. In the upright position it felt like you were slanting forward and I could feel the metal bars in the seat. It was an 8.5hr flight and was expecting the dinner service to take place quite quickly so I could take advantage of the lie flat bed. Dinner wasn't served until well after 2hrs into the flight and was a disappointment. The staff were friendly and helpful which was great but apart from that I didn't enjoy what should have been a comfortable flight.,Detractor
Again a mixed experience with Emirates EK407 MEL-DUB and EK017 DXB-MAN business class both on A380. Business seat would be tight for a large person cabin crew patchy on night flight from MEL. Food wise advertised items like cheese and coffee had to be specifically requested rather than routinely provided plane from Melbourne was an hour late in to Dubai resulting in a frantic dash over a long distance to Manchester. Plane service and food better on day service.,Passive
Flew Brisbane to Dubai on 777 and the onto Rome on A380. You really notice the difference between these two planes. The A380 is a lot quieter and seats are more comfortable and spacious. Would recommend sitting in the first section of economy we were rows 49 and 50. Food was of high standard and their entertainment system was fantastic. Easy to use up the time watching a couple of the late latest movies. Would highly recommend to anyone making the trip to Europe from Australia.,Promoter
I have just completed a trip LGW to HKG on Emirates via DXB in Business Class. The London to Dubai and Dubai to London were on a 777-300ER the DXB to HKG on an A380. What a difference. The A380 was comfort personified. You are cocooned in your little area with nobody beside or immediately in front of you - I was in seat 23K. You have plenty of space with easy access out to the aisle. The 777 however felt very cramped with somebody sitting next to you. When that passenger has his seat in bed mode you have to clamber over his legs to get out to the aisle. With the A380 you have plenty of storage space with the deep side compartments. On the 777 there is no place to store anything other than the overhead locker. Up until experiencing the A380/777 difference I have never much cared about the airplane I am sitting on - from now on for me it just has to be the A380. Had I taken all legs of this trip on the A380 the marks given would be much higher in the Trip Satisfaction and Seat Comfort.,Passive
1st November Dubai to Cape Town on EK 772 on a Boeing 777-300. Transfer in Dubai at night is always full but not as bad as on any other airport. Boarding was on time but had to wait for take off clearance as the pilot informed us. Flight was with snack at the beginning and a nice breakfast before landing with one meal being lactose free. Crew was nice and helpful. We got a nice sleep on the 9 hour flight. ICE Avod system was the new one with even more choices and movies. In CPT luggage was on the belt when we arrived there.

31st October. Flew Dusseldorf to Dubai on EK 56 on a Boeing 777-300ER. Check-in and seats we booked via travel agent were honored. Check in for economy with queue was still fast and easy. Boarding was half hour later due to technical. It took them almost 15 hour before take off but no problem so far. Boarding was quick and water was served since there was no air-conditioning on the ground due to the technical. On board we got the menu card and soon drinks and snacks where served before getting lunch. Meal choices was matched and even our no lactose meals was no problem. Flight was smooth and crew came around with water and juice. In between they served ice cream that was nice. ICE avod was nice with plenty of choices. Arriving in Dubai we got a remote stand so we where bussed to terminal that was quick because they use a lot of busses and there was no waiting at all. Would fly them again seats are nice with good legroom compared to LH UA AA or BA and AF/KL.,Promoter
Flew from Brussels-Dubai-Tokyo and back again a total of 34 hours on Emirates planes. Absolutely outstanding airline. The crew were immaculately turned out and very friendly. The plane was clean and the meals were delicious. The inflight entertainment was also very good with a wide choice of games/films though some of the older planes have a slightly less user friendly interface. One feature I liked was as your plane nears Dubai on the inflight entertainment screen you can see where your connecting flight gate/terminal is. Families with young kids also get complimentary strollers when they land.,Promoter

LHR - DXB - CPT. Quick boarding of A380 direct from T3 Emirates lounge. Centre pair of seats excellent for a couple. FAs rather robotic with little warmth or humour. Dinner service slow with overcooked main course. A380 impressively quiet on upper deck. Excellent IFE but annoying that one has to use supplied noise cancelling headphones. Flat bed seats reasonably comfortable. Quick disembarkation to huge Emirates lounge at DXB. Bizarre bus journey (30 minutes!) to 770-300 on the other side of the airport for the flight to CPT. FAs again going through the motions and food service just as slow as on A380. Flight noticeably noisier. 2-3-2 business class seating arrangement affords little privacy and seats don't lie fully flat. Arrived in CPT on time with impressively fast disembarkation and baggage collection.,Passive
MEL-AKL-MEL in J Class. Wonderful service on both sectors with a really varied and friendly crew on each sector. Staff were oblivious to the call button on the return leg the bight little light above my seat didn't attract anyone's attention which I found quite grating considering how professional these crew were appearing to be. The seats were extremely comfortable and although perhaps not quite as comfortable as some airlines lie flat fold over beds for sectors like this they were great. The scrambled eggs on the breakfast flight out of MEL were very disappointing and quite solid but a small grizzle. The dinner on the AKL-MEL leg was exceptional the best steak I've had in the sky! The bar at the back is a great feature it was packed coming back into MEL. For this reason I'd avoid sitting in the rear cabin the noise would be too much on a long night flight. Only real (yet again very minor in the scheme of things) complaint when our jackets were handed back as we started to descend there was nowhere to hang them around the seat. They had to lie crumpled on our lap or draped along the bins at the side. A hook in the seat back would be so handy. Would recommend anytime and aside from the couple of small complaints a perfect way to fly. Well done EK. SQ have lost themselves a regular traveller.,Promoter
Traveled Business Class to LHR - EK005 on the 5th November returning from MAN - EK022 on the 11th November 2014. The 380 flight to London had a delayed departure but this did not deter me from enjoying the flight in total. The return flight from Manchester on a 777-ER was serviced by a crew that was second to none. On both legs the quality of food served was excellent in fact I go as far to say it gets better and better every time I fly with Emirates. I am a gold Card member preferring to travel with Emirates on all my flights. Enjoying the journey with Emirates really starts in the Business lounges. The new Dubai dedicated 380 Lounge is wonderful the Manchester lounge is obviously smaller but very pleasing typical of the other Emirate lounges around the Globe.,Promoter

CPT-DXB-SIN. First leg old A343 that had really old IFE and seats. Food was good and the staff welcoming. For DXB-SIN I was on a 773 that had the current cabin and I was impressed all the way. Seats were really comfortable food was good staff were great and IFE was good. The only problems were the boarding process and delay. It was weird that passengers had to sit in separate areas of the holding room for boarding also there was an hour delay. If I had the chance I will try to fly EK again.,Promoter
LGW to HKG return. I was pleasantly surprised with this airline. The staff were actually interested in the passengers and polite and hard working. There was no amenity kit but we did get hot towels. The food was tasty and plenty of it. Sensibly they only served a light snack on the very early departure from Dubai. We were late leaving London but made up the time and caught our connection. Plenty of films to watch. The seats were comfortable especially on the A380.It made a nice change to go from Gatwick.,Promoter
Recently flew AMS-DBX-BKK the first time that I deviated from my favourite SQ. Flight left AMS 75m late and approaching DBX was put in a holding pattern for over an hour. That - and the fact that the A380 was parked about 25m by bus away the terminal - left me very little time to catch my connecting flight even though I was in the second bus. Surprisingly on reaching the terminal there was no ground staff around - there must have been many people missing connections - and after security I had to walk a long distance and eventually did not make it in time. After queuing for over an hour in front of an understaffed Emirates transit desk I finally got booked onto a later flight and spent the following 5h in the Emirates Business lounge. That following flight - a 777 - left an hour late too. Was lucky that my Emirates chauffeur-drive was still available in BKK. The flights were otherwise uneventful. Seating on both planes was good but definitely less roomy than on SQ's 777. Food was OK service on board friendly. My return flight is coming up and hopefully that will be a better experience transit- wise. Will withhold my recommendation of Emirates to others till after that event. Again I was very much surprised that nobody was meeting the transit passengers arriving over 2h late. In similar situations at Changi/Singapore SQ staff is there to either get you to your plane in time or if it too late altogether make immediate arrangements to get you to your destination as soon as possible.,Passive

My first leg was with a fabulous crew of young female flight attendants. I was travelling with my husband and my 9 year old daughter. My daughter was treated like an absolute princess. My daughter was given flight packs and a child's meal (which I didn't request). The service was excellent and served with a smile and professional manner. The food was lovely better than expected. The food was some of the loveliest presented airline food I have had. The cabin toilets were always kept clean and dry. The inflight entertainment ICE is second to none.

Used a bus to board our connecting flight to HAM at Dubai. We had to carry our baby and stand in the bus during 20-30 minutes bus ride. No seats available. We had our hand luggage as well.

It was our first time with Emirates and we expected to have good service for the price we paid. I would not recommend Emirates.,Detractor
The seats are uncomfortable the staff service is poor they take along time to come when we need them.

LGW-DXB-CMB-DXB-LGW. All flights economy class on B777-300ER. My first time flying with Emirates and a good experience overall. All flights on time. Comfortable seats but on the 777 you would not want to be sat next to a large person as the seats are 10-abreast in economy rather than the usual 9. Excellent touch screen entertainment using ICE system. Very good food served. Sadly Dubai International is not big enough for the large numbers of passengers and was heaving and cramped.

Business class on the A380 offers an excellent experience with the best IFE there is a comfortable and cosy seat that sits well in all positions (including fully-flat bed). The drinks on offer are also excellent best cappuccino there is in the clouds but the food is very average with the menu not changing often and the mains being the true letdown. Transfer at DXB T3 very efficient as always. First on the 777-300ER is truly great with private suites an excellent seat that converts in a very comfortable bed (am 192cm tall) fine a la carte dining huge tv screen. As good as it gets!,Promoter
Very good airline but unfortunately the boarding/disembarking procedures at Dubai airport are a nightmare. Except for flights operated with A380 which are parked at gates for many flights operated with B777 and A330 the airplanes are parked at remote stands which means long (20 to 40 minutes) transfers by bus between planes and the terminal building. I do not recommend flying with Emirates unless on the A380.,Detractor

Copenhagen to Manila via Dubai. The flight from Copenhagen was 1 hour delayed because of late arrival from Dubai. Boarding in Copenhagen was fast. The service from Copenhagen to Dubai on the flight was good and the ICE system working well. The boarding in Dubaifor the flight to Manila was good. The plane was one of the older models of the 777 so for the ICE system you needed to use the remote. The return flight from Manila to Dubai was good the check in was fast and nice that they are now using terminal 3. Boarding was good and first time I saw boarding using zones not used in the other airports. The plane was an old B777 and the IFE system was not working well - it was stopping in middle of movies.

Leaving on QF 1 on 12 Oct and from Dubai back to Sydney via London on Emirates planes. All sectors on A380. The aircraft is the common factor between Qantas and Emirates. But the experience is so different. The Qantas flight attendants are very professional in the way they go about their work. Emirates FA's are to a man and woman under 30 lack experience and customer skills. On EK 2 from LHR to Dubai on Saturday 18 October it was particularly bad. A couple of FA's would not have been out of place on easyJet. One fixed up her lipstick during a meal service whilst serving. On four sectors flown in the last week on Qantas and Emirates planes it can be said that Qantas came out way on top. This is not some pro Australian rant. Have been using Qantas and Emirates combination for a while now and the same result. What can Emirates do? Get some serious training for their cabin crews and some old heads on board to oversee the younger staff. At the moment they all look and act like kids serving in McDonald's. I will continue to fly Emirates as their scheduling from Australia is so good and much of my work is in the Gulf and Europe.,Passive
First and probably last time with Emirates. At least not on this connection to Beijing. EK306 arrives into Beijing at 15:10h. It is a 500 Passenger flight arriving simultaneously with other flights from Singapore Hong-Kong Dubai Doha Fukuoka and Vancouver. Immigration took nearly 2 hours due to the masses of people arriving. Chauffeur Service did not wait. Disgraceful Emirates Service at the Airport and no apologies whatsoever. The immigration staff did their very best to speed up the process and all 24 Counters were open. Just way way to many people arriving at the same time. 15.10.2014 EK60 HAM-DXB on B777 and continuing on EK306 DXB-PEK A380. Chauffeur service to HAM excellent new Mercedes S-Class all the comfort you need before a 16h Trip to Beijing. Lounge at HAM okay - lots of good quality food and drink quiet and very large thus not crowded even though flight was fully booked in Business Class. Aircraft was very new (April 2014) but 5 Row Business Class is just unacceptable. No real storage. Agree with most users that Seat is much too narrow and doesn't go fully flat (opposed to A380) I am a smaller person and the seat would not really fit in any position. Food was okay. Good but grumpy stewardess serving my seat. Overall a typical flight on a fully packed plane. DXB is a very nice airport (even at night) but very crowded. Business Lounge in T3A is good but very slow and spotty WiFi. Boarding directly to A380 Upper Deck is a nice touch but also clearly a necessity because of the crowds and cramped waiting areas for Y guests on the main floor. Flight DXB-PEK was comfortable had a good sleep - service was uneventful. Business Class was about 70% Full. On Board Entertainment again the best I have seen yet. The rest about Emirates has been explained on a platitude of occasions here.,Detractor
I took the flight from Shanghai Pudong(PVG)-Dubai(DXB)-Hamburg(HAM) and FRA-DXB-PVG.The seats of A380 is comfortable and the food is nice. The air hosts and hostesses were very helpful. Shopping at Dubai Int'l Airport was so convenient because they received Euro and US Dollar. But the 18 hrs trip is a little tired!,Promoter
Compared to anything we have in the U.S. and other international airlines I've flown this organization is top- notch. Or at least they try to be. Flew the A380 JFK to Dubai and A340 Dubai to Seychelles and back again. Were upgraded to Business Class on the second leg which was absolutely amazing. The A340 seats not as comfortable as the A380 but once you're on the A380 it's hard to find anything to complain about. Service great pillows headphones blankets great entertainment. My husband enjoyed the music options and we both enjoyed the in-flight information system. Bathrooms plentiful and clean seats comfortable boarding and disembarking painless and we got our free meal vouchers in the Dubai airport and got our free meal! How many airlines do that? I hate to fly but this was definitely a treat. It was a bit pricey to say the least but you get what you pay for. I think Emirates are doing a great job. Would gladly fly them again. Customer service did their best in every area.,Promoter
"We recently travelled on Emirates but were disappointed that the flight home from Dubai/Adelaide was overbooked and on arrival at the check counter at 11.30pm for a 2.00am departure that we would not be able to board the flight. Our luggage was tagged and we were asked to wait until the plane was boarding to see if our seats would be available (along with 4 other passengers). With 40 mins to go we were told that we could now board and to hurry through customs immigrations and no stopping to shop so that we would make the flight. We were given EUD 100 each to spend on duty free on the flight but the crew told us that ""they were far too busy to offer any duty free items"" and this was a 12 hour flight. We still have the vouchers but what good are they to us?",Detractor

Flew LGW-DXB-MEL-AKL in First on 23 September 777/A380. The First class experience exceeded my expectations. On all three sectors cabin crew were efficient and friendly with immediate responses to any service request. Chauffeur service worked exactly as booked. All lounges offered high standards of seating and refreshments. A la carte menu on all sectors offered meals to a very high restaurant standard. Shower facility on A380 well managed and co-ordinated and welcome towards the end of a 14 hour sector.,Promoter
Flew AKL-SYD-DXB-LGW in First on 12 October. On the outward journey all crews on the three sectors were highly professional motivated and friendly with good banter ensuing throughout the flights.

"CMB-DXB: EK655: A330-200 Oct 12: Business Class. Plane immaculate for its age (1999-2000). However horribly let down by the most uncomfortable Business Class seats I've ever experienced over the past 17 years. Seven across in Business Class instead of six in an A330 is a rip-off. These seats are nothing like the nice new modular units in their B777-300ER aircraft. The video remote control intrudes into the 18"" wide seats making them clamp-like seats. Not suitable for the 4.5 hour flight. Service was very good and the food and beverages were good too. There were only five passengers that day in Business Class on this flight and I had the single row area behind First Class to myself. The tray table is too low when the seat is even slightly reclined. These are old cradle seats not flatbeds. The whole experience was let down by these awful seats the main reason one buys Business Class in the first place to get more personal space not something worse-than Economy Plus. Check-in and the dedicated Emirates Lounge at the BIA in CMB were excellent. On time performance and good baggage transfer to my connecting BA flight. EK is generally good but not their A330-200 seats.",Passive
I usually fly to Europe in economy class with Singapore Airlines via Singapore or Thai Airways via Bangkok but was persuaded to try Emirates. I found the 14.5 hours from Sydney to Dubai to be unbearable. The service from flight staff was both difficult to access and disinterested. Staff on the second leg to Amsterdam were much more personable. The experience was so bad that I have paid almost $3800 to upgrade to Business Class for the return journey. It had better be worth it!,Detractor
Flown MNL-DXB-MNL Sept 20 on EK 337. I was amazed by the in-flight service. Five drink runs on an 8 hour flight food is plenty and palatable. All the crew are hard-working attentive and friendly.

LAX to Hyderabad Economy October 102014 I always use Singapore Airlines and I decided to try Emirates for a change. Long story short: Singapore Airlines wins. Pros - the seating is comfortable great selection on entertainment nice mood lighting nice warm facial towels are provided to freshen up quick water service when requested. Cons - Food I ordered a Asian vegetarian meal 2 weeks in advance. It is actually offered as a part of the regular choice of 3 main course meals but it ran out before it got to my seat. This happened on the Dubai to Hyderabad flight which was for 3.5 hours. On the other flight I lucked out getting the last vegetarian meal. The main food meal service (lunch or dinner) is pretty filling. I felt Emirates should have reserved Asian vegetarian meals for those who pre-order and offer extra ones for the rest of the passengers during the service. A vegetarian pizza was given as a light snack in between - very salty. Dubai airport is poor when I compare it to Changi in Singapore. I was given a meal voucher at the ticketing desk. If you have a layover for over 4 hours you can get a free meal at Dubai airport. Also the free internet stations are horrible. The internet is slow and the machines cannot seem to load Internet explorer. I gave up after 5 mins of trying. Not worth using the Wifi there either. Dubai airport ever heard of high speed internet? Be prepared for the most unfriendly airport staff you will ever come across. No smile angry replies. Have a good flight if you are considering this airline.,Detractor
Arrived at Dubai DBX at 18.15 for 21.45 on 10/10/14 flight to Perth to be told flight was over booked we had been travelling through Europe for eight weeks and had a stop over in Dubai. I was very surprised to hear we had no seats having booked the flight nearly 12 months in advance. We only managed to secure seats after we explained our daughter was flying overseas on the 11/10/14 and we would not see her for 3 months. We have travelled with Emirates several times because of the quick connecting flights to Europe but intend to look at other airlines operating from that area in future. We were very disappointed they way we were treated by Emirates on the last leg of our journey home it was the only blemish of our holiday.,Detractor
6 Aug Gatwick-Dubai EK0010. 11 Aug Dubai - Singapore EK 0352. Sep 8 Singapore-Heathrow EK0005. London-Dubai service was appalling. Dinner was served after midnight although the flight took off at 8.15pm by then I was desperate for water which the crew kept saying they would serve with dinner. They ran out of choices on their menu and could only serve chicken. We were not served any breakfast nor a beverage before landing. However the flight from Dubai-Singapore was better than the one from Heathrow to Singapore. I won't take this flight unless it is the only airline that'll take me to the destination.,Detractor
After not having flown on Emirates in almost 7 years I recently flew EK round trip NYC/JFK to Milan/MXP. Departed on Thu 2nd Oct and returned Wed 8th Oct. Friendly service on both flights. Smiling and smartly turned out flight attendants on both flights always seen in the cabins. On the outbound flight - flying time of 7 hours 5 minutes 2 hot meals served. In between the meals 2 beverage services were provided. I like many other passengers skipped the hot breakfast in favor of more sleep time. On my return flight with flying time of 8 hours and 40 minutes a copious hot lunch was followed by an offering of fresh fruits and snack bars from wicker baskets. This was followed by a hot pizza snack and then about an hour prior to landing the same wicker baskets with fruits snack bars and pre-wrapped vegetarian sandwiches were offered. All of this in economy class! What more do passengers want?,Promoter
DMM-DXB-LAX return trip on Sept 18 and Oct 6 2014. I am a frequent traveller on this route at least 3 times a year and always with Emirates. After so many years of loyalty I am now tempted to try other airlines for the following reasons: Menu does not change on this route and it gets so unexciting and predictable after so many flights. While quantity of food is generous the taste is so below average. I have never seen sea-food being offered on this menu it is always the predictable steak Indian dish and Arabic dish. On board service consistency is very patchy sometimes I am lucky to be served by kind and helpful flight attendant in 50% of the flights I had not. Simple things such as smile when attending the customer never miss any customer when laying down mattress on long haul flight will be appreciated. While other aspects such as on-time arrival IFE lounge access complimentary limousine pick up at LAX are fine the on-board menu needs to be improved to retain customer loyalty. Considering that Emirates are charging premium and much more expensive that competitors I see no reason why it cannot improve on the menu and consistency of on-board service. Loyal customers such as myself are now shopping around for better experience and value than what Emirates is offering at the moment on the route. With less generous miles and redeeming a ticket now will cost close to 1000 dollars in additional fees and charges there has been something Emirates truly learned from its partner Qantas in how to upset its loyal customers by slapping them with 4 digit charges. Come on Emirates you used to wow me but not anymore.,Passive
EK147 Y 22 Sep Dubai to Amsterdam. First time with Emirates on their A380 crew friendly on boarding. Seating was comfortable with excellent inflight entertainment system. Was served a light breakfast after departure which was tasty. We were situated reasonably close to the galley on this flight and I can't but help feel this particular crew may have been in training under the eyes of a supervisor with exacting standards. The inflight service food and beverage service was great not too much but not too little. Inflight announcements were clear. Lunch menu had a good choice and again was very tasty as was the free flowing wine service which I personally enjoyed.,Promoter
ICN-DXB and DXB-LIS between October 5/6 on economy. Check-in was smooth and simple at ICN. Departed about 10 minutes late but arrived about 20 minutes early. Staff ranged from nice to snippy. Food was good with multiple drinks services in between meals. Noodles were available between meals but didn't see anyone having them. Entertainment system on A380 was state-of-the-art and worked perfectly with countless movies TV shows and albums to pick from. Wi-fi was free on that flight thanks to Eid and worked flawlessly on phone and tablet. Seats comfortable and roomy. Arrival and transfer in DXB was normal. DXB-LIS had an older B777 which is not as good but my window seat was on the back which has a 2-4-2 configuration. Recommend getting a seat on that section as you have more aisle space. Food was better than on the other flight with multiple drinks services in between meals again. Entertainment system is the same but the touch screen wasn't as responsive and software was slightly slower due to age of plane. Staff was nicer and didn't mind engaging in chit-chat with passengers. Departed 15 minutes late but arrived 30 minutes early. Overall very nice flights and airline.,Promoter
I flew NCL-DEL-NCL. The flight was good. I ordered a special meal and this was provided. The flight attendants were very receptive and helpful. The entertainment system was one of the best I've used. It had a very wide variety to offer. The seats were neat clean and comfortable. Will definitely fly again.,Promoter
Long time Emirates business class passenger - Australia to UK and or Europe. Flights and services are deteriorating and we will look to another airline after recent trips in September. Flight from Melbourne to Dubai was given a gate at Cargo terminal in Dubai resulting in long delays in off loading passengers and luggage and our luggage (plus the other passenger's) then missed our next flight to Zurich. Staff not good on flight. Dubai to Zurich staff were better. Returning found no Emirates business lounge at Amsterdam - desk staff embarrassed and unhelpful.

Just flew return BNE to DXB on A380 and then onto VCE on a B777. I agree with what many on here have said. If your flight is on an A380 then it will be excellent plenty of space plenty of food and drinks toilets clean and spacious. If you are on on B777 not so good - cramped seat configuration staff overworked felt not much different to a budget carrier. If it were a long haul flight I would consider another airline.,Passive
"Flew on the EK 38 on September from Birmingham to Dubai. First time flight on Emirates very disappointed! Expected great things long wait for bar service told not long after two hours food arrived no drinks. Asked cabin crew ""it's a short flight"" we are not serving drinks until later. Really not what we were expecting. Biggest problem was the very poor attitude of crew. Complaints department said drink fountains are provided.",Detractor
My flight was a true class act. Flew First Class DFW-DXB and it was better than expected. The crew were friendly and personable aiming to please throughout the flight. From the Dom Perignon champagne to onboard shower onboard lounge at the back of business class to the limo ride to my hotel in Dubai it was a flight to remember. This was my first time flying Emirates and after reading some of the mixed reviews here I have to say my experience surpassed all my expectations. For the benefit of readers I have flown a lot being a Lufthansa Hon (highest tier status) for the past 6 years. My opinion is the European carriers have a lot of catching up to do if they are to retain their share of premium passengers especially from the USA where Emirates is rapidly expanding.,Promoter
Bangkok to Dubai and then on to BHX. A very pleasant trip on both legs of the Journey. The only gripe I have was the seven hour wait in Dubai but that was my fault for booking that flight. The flight crew were great the food was great and the ICE entertainment was world class. The return trip BHX to Dubai and Bangkok was great. No complaints from me except one (when food was served the crew did not ask the people to put their seat back to the upright position). Other than that I can say that Emirates are a very good Airline to fly with and I would have no hesitation in flying with them again in the future.,Promoter

Having flown First or Business class long-haul from east-coast Australia to north Africa the Middle-East and Spain three times as well as trans-Pacific to North America twice in 11 months I consider I am well qualified to say that both Emirates' First and Business on their A380s simply don't cut it. From the time my wife and I checked in at Brisbane there was simply nothing to make us feel special. plane seating is okay but no better than Etihad and the onboard shower more a time-filling novelty. A flight is not just the time on board. The lounge in Brisbane is dull and sparse and as it is shared with at least 84 traveling Business plus whatever FF card-holders are in economy not surprisingly very crowded and noisy. There is nothing to make the $23000 expended on First Class deliver any kind of special or exclusive feel. Onboard the outbound leg the cabin crew were obviously tired and disinterested. To land in Dubai and have to be off-loaded via stairs in the desert-heat and put on a bus for a 15 minute 5 kilometre lap of the on-going massive airport expansion project only to have to then walk scurry elevator and shuttle-pod back to almost where we started taking over an hour from landing to lounge. Lucky we're fit and speedy as it is a physical challenge after the 15 hours on board. The cabin crew on to Barcelona was a complete contrast to the tired Brisbane-Dubai crew with attentive service. Arrival in Spain was slick and via an air bridge. Departure however was a different story with the crowded lounge and nothing to eat except ham sandwiches crisps and a platter of limp stale pastries. The crew and onboard service were fine and the airbridge arrival in Dubai on time. The return Dubai to Brisbane was the final straw that at this stage has turned me off Emirates possibly forever. The chauffeur failed to arrive at our hotel. On arrival at the First check-in nobody could care less about out the chauffeur not showing up. First check-in promptly spat out the boarding passes and told us to get moving as it was a 20 minute walk to the gate. We managed to find a small First lounge just past the gate and had time for a quick refres. At gate 23 there was no separate priority boarding for First or Business passengers. All 520 passengers were jostling and pushing to get through one small door. Emirates boarding was farcical and sums up what Emirates have become. Once onboard staff did their jobs providing good attention all the way to Brisbane. First offers cabin service pretty much on demand however one thing I have never noticed previously in First was the constant clattering of cutlery and crockery. There are no socks at all and earplugs have to be requested. We also found the cabin hot and noisy and despite repeated requests by us and other passengers in First it remained uncomfortably hot. In conclusion I won't choose Emirates again.,Detractor
I neither would fly Emirates again nor recommend them. They position themselves as a high end service but are actually low cost/low service. We just flew Rome to Sydney via Dubai and Bangkok. The Dubai to Sydney sector was an old 777 with 10 abreast seating (3-4-3). The 777 was designed for 9 abreast seating but EK has added an extra seat in the middle. The cabin is like a sardine can. The service was amateur. The entertainment system average. A horrid flight and experience. EK positions itself against Singapore Cathay Qantas and the like. However it really is a third rate airline. Never again.,Detractor
"Emirates service has down downhill over the last few years. Recently flew Melbourne to Dubai and return. A380 both ways. Check in staff very disinterested. Plane was extremely hot. I rang for some water - no one came. The second time I went to the galley and asked for a drink. Staff just gave me a drink and walked off. Passengers recline their seats during meal times which makes life very difficult. Food was appalling on flight over and back - stale bread rolls even warmed up croissants tasted stale. Dubai check in staff even worse than Melbourne for return flight. The woman went to put wrong labels on my luggage. When I pointed this out she said ""Well there are two flights to Melbourne"" - I would have thought that was her job to check not mine. Very hard to get a drink on flight going home. Snacks were handed out in the night but our row missed out. A man sitting behind me asked for some nuts and was told ""There are no nuts for economy passengers"". Sought of sums up the whole attitude.",Detractor
2 Oct Glasgow-Dubai 777-300ER. Check in smooth and easy at Glasgow. Flight was nearly an hour late taking off which made our connection tight in Dubai. Can't fault the staff or service on board although the food wasn't great. Sat at the back of the plane in one of the few rows of two seats. Dubai-Hong Kong A380 - wider seats and much smoother ride. Again food quite bland but all crew were friendly and cheerful. Switched seats at check in to an empty row towards the back and luckily had all three seats to ourselves so very comfortable journey.,Promoter
I have flown Emirates pretty much all my life. Emirates considers itself one of the best airlines - I think this is true only sometimes. For the most part I see the service (on certain routes) getting worse with time. By service I mean that of the cabin crew. They do not seem to like their jobs at all and don't like dealing with passengers. I agree it's not nice dealing with certain passengers who don't co-operate but why treat everyone the same way? And why must we hear what the cabin crew have to say about the unruly passengers? With some other routes I still do see very friendly cabin crew from time to time but it's rare now. Entertainment is pretty good on some flights but some routes it's terrible almost non-existent. I do like the food though. The flights would be so much better if the cabin crew seem less - angry impatient and grumpy. You almost feel like a criminal when you request something!,Passive

Caught the Dubai to Adelaide 300-777 Sept 18 2014. After the A380 experience this was definitely a louder bumpier ride! Seats were smaller and more cramped. People had far to much cabin baggage which really annoyed me on this flight as it was us who had stuck to the rules of 7kg limit 1 bag who had to separate our luggage and have it stashed all over the plane. I feel this should be policed by the terminal staff. Our luggage was only ever weighed leaving Adelaide airport. The people in front reclined their seats fully for the whole trip and they were not asked to sit upright when we were trying to eat which had happened on other recent flights. The galley was very noisy especially in down time when the passengers where trying to sleep. The toilets were very noisy when flushed and although we were seated away from the toilet we still constantly got woken by them. Ambience was lovely. Plane was clean and fresh looking although a little worn around the edges. Food was tasty and a lot of it. Drinks were regular but cold drinks were warm. Seemed a common problem on all our flights. Staff were friendly and attentive just loud. My entertainment screen was broken and wouldn't work by touch once I worked out the hand set this was ok. The audio was broken and static I had to listen to one ear input only! This was a shame as the other experiences I had were great and despite this I would still fly Emirates and recommend them to friends.,Passive
Caught the A380 from Rome to Dubai Sept 17th. Plane was lovely clean plenty of room. Took awhile to board at Rome airport and everyone seemed to want to push on.

Got the A380 from Dubai to Heathrow EK001. Loved the plane. Very new looking and swish! Toilets updated and cleaned regularly seats roomy and I am a big lady! Entertainment was great. Staff were a little harassed thought they were maybe understaffed as very different from earlier connecting flight. They still managed to get all the food delivered and drink runs done! Boarding was easy in Dubai despite this being or first venture outside of English speaking countries. Felt a little less special than at Adelaide but then that would be because in Adelaide we were the special ones at Dubai we were one of many! Plane was very quiet compared to the 777 a bit more clumsy on take off and landing though! I think this is more plane design issue. Food was outstanding. Very tasty and a lot of it!,Promoter
First Long Haul flight to Dubai from Adelaide EK441 300-777. Found boarding at Adelaide International very professional and easy! Seats were at back of plane. My choice however we picked seats that had immovable solid sides and as I was larger it made it a bit squashed however I was glad of the extra aisle room as the 3 seater areas looked very small and often the passengers seemed to get bumped a lot! Toilets were clean until the end of the trip where they were over used and left messy the food was great. Very tasty and a lot of it. Left feeling full! Cold drinks were warm and hot drinks were cold. Service was great though. Staff seemed very friendly. The comfort bags were good and we used the eye pads and blankets.

This is the first time that I have flown with Emirates and if I can avoid it I will never fly with them again. The service was terrible - the meal was served and half an hour later they came to ask if we wanted beverages with our dinner. Bit late as most people had already finished. The leg room was not adequate for an average person and the staff were very indifferent to the passengers. In Dubai it was more important that the girls behind the desk send text messages than attend to customers. We actually had to ask them to help us even though there were two people behind the desk and no one except us waiting. So much for customer service. I can't think of anything positive about the experience. By comparison Qantas for the second leg to Sydney was a dream with attentive staff beverages offered at the same time as meals. Snacks bought around every hour as well as water and other beverages offered every hour. The toilets were clean and tidy and the staff were super friendly. Could not fault their service.,Detractor
Emirates Flight 406 from Dubai to Melbourne 22 SEP. The limousine failed to pick us up at our hotel which had been arranged the previous day. There were no ground staff to show us the way to the lounge/gate. On board I found the staff less than friendly. I expect to receive prompt attention when I request water to be replaced and food to be delivered during the breakfast service. My past experience has been satisfactory the steward aboard our Nice to Dubai flight on 20 SEP made sure we knew the aircraft features and helped with our carry-on bag at the bottom of the stairs on our arrival in Dubai. The state of the Business washroom on 22 SEP was unsatisfactory. I followed a staff member who had just used the washroom and found the litter container full and overflowing toilet paper on the floor and the toilet bowl very dirty.

We flew last night from Athens to Dubai and Dubai to Singapore and both flights were horrible.

EK432 Dubai to Brisbane via Singapore (Continuation after EK2 - see separate post). Economy B777-300ER. Disembarking from EK2 all transfer pax clear a security check before entering the terminal eliminating the need for it at the gate. Clear signage to the next gate. Not impressed with T3B terminal. Boarding was just turn up and go. No order. Once onboard the difference between the A380 and B777 is quiet marked. Seats an inch smaller and the aisles are smaller too. I had an aisle seat and every time the trolley or a person went by I was bumped. The person next to me was a little above average and kept leaning into my seat when she fell asleep. It was most uncomfortable not helped by the AV units under the seat taking up space. The food offerings on the first 7 hours sector was too light. A roll and breakfast of cheese omelette. No sausage bacon or baked beans. The last dinner I had was a bit bland a beef casserole. Would have benefited from a wine reduction. The AV on this craft was the old ICE. Far more limited and a smaller very blurry screen. Very difficult to get it to load were you wanted. We had a medical emergency and had to make a landing in India. We were told it would take 30 mins but it added 2 hours to our trip arriving at 2.30 BNE time. At no point did the crew tell us what time we were expected to arrive in BNE. I had to spend my time in Singapore looking on the web to find out and make arrangements. Very poor form. This along with the incredibly uncomfortable seats on the 777 make it extremely unlikely I will fly with Emirates again if this is the only option available.,Detractor
"Perth - Dubai - Stockholm then Heathrow - Dubai - Perth. On a Qantas ticket but code shared with Emirates. Emirates Business Class consistently high standard. Personal greetings and introductions nothing too much trouble. Food and beverages excellent. Lounges excellent especially in Perth. Emirates Business seats are slightly narrow for sleeping but overall good. Contrast with Qantas is very stark - Heathrow - Dubai was with QF with other 3 legs with Emirates. QF not quite ""sit down shut up and don't bother us"" - but that's what it felt like. The lesson is - get a QF ticket to get the points and status credits but fly on Emirates codeshare planes to get the service.",Promoter
"EK402 London Heathrow to Dubai connecting to EK432 to Brisbane (See separate report) Economy Class A380. First ever flight with Emirates. Check in at LHR quick and efficient. Carry on bags were weighed and tagged at check in. Boarding by zones seem to make it quick but it did take a long time. Lots of people wanting to swap seats and a few claiming to be ill to get an upgrade or window seat. Selected bulkhead seat and had couple with baby next to me. Toilets in front and the full size door opened 180 if left and would hit me. People would step on my feet while waiting for the loo. Food was good but there was supposed to be a ""sweet treat"" served with the pre landing drinks. This didn't happen. Given this is about the same length as LHR-JFK BA and AA serve a proper snack. If we were meant to hold onto the ""Light Bites"" from the meal tray then it wasn't made clear. ICE+ was very good but the armrest for the bulk head seats was too low. 18"" seats felt comfortable. Staff very good. Overall a satisfactory flight for the distance flown.",Promoter
I have flow with Emirates 6 times now and there are some very good good and poor aspects to the overall experience. In particular I refer to our Istanbul to Dubai flight on 7 Aug 2014. There was the normal long delay in check-in due in perceive (after working 30 years in aviation) large quantity of check in baggage that Emirates passengers have - some would see as a plus - combined with minimal experience staff. But the carry on baggage was the big issue both in regard to safety and comfort! Some people were bringing 35kg on board. Bags that just fitted into the lockers and a passenger opposite us had three of them. The onboard staff just helped them put more into the lockers without regard to the effect on others of the 100 passengers I could observe we were the only ones under the 7kg stated limit. When a senior crew from business class started stuffing our soft bags into a smaller space so they could get others large bags away and close the doors I was pointedly told what I could do with my concerns. He did not dispute that others had 35kg of carry on bags! In addition we had 2 obese passengers next to us. The crew provided them with extension seat belts but this doesn't stop them squashing those adjacent. Again the crew were unhelpful. I spent most of the flight walking around the aircraft. Finally the food on this flight was well below the standard I have known on other Emirates flights.,Detractor
London to Dubai on 6/9 flight EK 012 and returned 12/9 flight EK 0009. I flew business class with Emirates both on 777 and 380 airbus. The seats were narrow in the extreme even on the 380 and I found it very uncomfortable. The staff were 'going through the motions' and the food was tepid. I have flown with many airlines-first time with Emirates. If you compare them to Qantas they have much to learn. Not impressed at all and will avoid in future.,Detractor
I've flown Emirates over a period of ten years and I can comprehensively say that every time I fly the service is getting worse. Emirates pitch themselves as being a top-top airline and to a degree the service they offer on paper is quite comprehensive. Their route network is very good and their fares at times can be competitive however the last four long haul flights I've taken with Emirates progressively gets worse. The cabin staff seem disinterested in providing a first class service to the nonchalant ground staff in Dubai. They are cutting back massively on quality they've stopped handing out comfort packs for flights the food is getting worse and the cabin crew don't respond to calls made from your chair. I can give quite a few examples of bad service travelling with Emirates over the last few trips however it was compounded by a poor experience travelling with an infant recently. I've always looked forward to flying with Emirates and I have quite a few Tier Miles and Skywards miles however I feel I've flown my last flight with Emirates.,Detractor
I flew SYD-BKK in Sep 2014. This was my first time flying Emirates though certainly not my first time flying. I've flown quite a few of the greats (ie Cathay Singapore Malaysian Qantas etc) but Emirates completely impressed me. I flew economy and the furnishings and ambience felt and looked better than most economy cabins I've been in. The service was fantastic. Friendly and fast. Not to mention the flight attendants were immaculately groomed well-presented and spoken and quite attractive (male and female). Their overall demeanour was professional friendly and classy. This is in stark contrast to other airlines (ahem Qantas) whose cabin crew look and act like they'd rather be elsewhere. The food was good and plentiful and the in-flight entertainment was excellent.,Promoter
Flew Mumbai - Dubai on the Boeing 777-200 ER. Even though the flight arrived late into Mumbai I applaud the Emirates staff at Mumbai to do everything possible to keep the flight on-time and it was with a slight 5-10 min delay in departure. The aircraft had the ICE AVOD system. The first 30 mins of my flight wasn't satisfying as my PTV froze after take off and crew members did not help. It was only a seat change which actually made my experience on Emirates really worthwhile. I was glad to see the patience the Emirates cabin crew have in dealing with passengers. Crew were polite well-mannered and courteous. Food was great. However my seat seemed to be a little bit on the uncomfortable side but I guess for this short sector its pretty good.,Promoter
First time Business Class with EK. VIE-DXB-HKG.DXB-VIE. Disappointing service by cabin crew remote stand in DXB on the way out lounge in DXB very different in the Terminal areas. A380 nice but bar closing early and was partly not staffed while all cabin crew chatting in the back. Service the pure minimum for the travel class (small selection and medium quality) and inflexible. You did not see staff after main service. Woken up for breakfast just to wait half an hour for it and the last hour of the flight there was no service and bar closed. I could have slept longer this happened on both A380 flights. IFE is great good selection. Expectations where high as was the ticket price and EK did not deliver in my view.,Detractor
LHR-DXB-BKK / BKK-DXB-LHR. My first experience with Emirates and it was an impressive one. All flights on time with no issues with connecting flights. Outward connection at Dubai for 3 hours was a bit too long followed by another 6 hour flight to Bangkok would have meant feeling shattered on arrival but it was a brand new 777-300 and it was empty I counted 10 pax in our section so climbed on the 4 seats and slept uninterrupted until woken for landing. How anyone can not be impressed by the A380 beggars belief. We had seats in the rear on outward front section on return and it's incredibly quiet compared to the 747! Plenty of leg room (I'm 6ft) and comfortable seats. Food quality was good too I've flown Thai quite a few times and the food as been excellent every time for me Emirates was not far behind. Plenty of drink runs and flight attendants were helpful and courteous. The ICE system needs hardly any mention it's simply superb especially on the A380. Online check-in and seat selection made this experience an effortless one. We landed at LHR at a busy time early Friday evening we were off the aircraft through border control and collected our luggage within 50 minutes! All in all can't fault Emirates. Would recommend and certainly fly again.,Promoter
"I have travelled Emirates a lot but the last 2 experiences were not as anticipated. We flew from Gatwick to Johannesburg via Dubai on the 26th June 2014. Staff on flight to Dubai were good kids fed and good attention. Flight to Johannesburg was not so staff seemed occupied and unavailable. You had to keep asking for things like kids toys drinks etc which I do not really like doing. Return flight to the UK via Dubai on the 2nd of September was the worst of them all. Staff are different now to when we flew a year ago on the same route. Check in was a hassle in JNB and Dubai. Our 2 year old was not given a child's meal because ""it was not booked"" we had to keep asking for almost everything. Both kids were not given the complimentary toys. The cabin crew seem to have no people skils at all - only one seemed to be on top of his game. Previous staff 2011-2013 were always happy caring and service was impeccable. Standards have changed and I will be trying other airlines after such an experience. Emirates have to do something about their staff especially in terms of customer services and people skills. Travelling with kids is not easy and Emirates has been one of the airlines very good at easing this but this has changed.

Emirates have very clean and modern aircraft excellent entertainment and easy transfers to and from flights within Dubai.

Next time I will fly another carrier. Crew should treat every pax as they would want their family members treated and remember they have chosen to be there!,Passive
My wife and I live in Singapore and consequently fly quite frequently to visit family/friends. Emirates have always been one of our top choice airlines for 7 years. It is therefore with sadness that I have to complain about the in-flight service received on flight EK37 on 10th July which was the beginning of a tour of the UK. We have always found the stewards very professional in their approach and care for passengers. However on this flight even before we were airborne personal and banal chit-chat from the staff was very audible from where we were sitting and remained so for the entirety of the flight. Throughout the flight the emergency exit behind us was blocked by the trolley and an ever-growing pile of cardboard rubbish which prevented us from standing to stretch our legs. Furthermore when we did stand it was made quite clear that we were in the way. During meal service the air stewardess commenced the service with my wife only to be shouted at that she had started at the wrong â€˜end'. Consequently she left midway in serving my wife and proceeded to the other â€˜end'. This has somewhat clouded our view of Emirates and we are reluctant given the price of a ticket these days to fly with this airline again.,Detractor

Just flown Emirates for the first time Manchester-Dubai-Singapore-Melbourne out Mel-KL-Dubai-Manchester return. All in Economy. 14th August to 14th September. I won't use them again. Apart from one leg a more miserable unenthusiastic group of attendants I have yet to see. Food on all of the sections was grim. ICE entertainment on way back awful. On three sections delays and not one explanation even after the First and Business clients complained after us poor souls in economy.

We flew from London to Dubai on 9th September 2014 on the A380 with two children one infant and toddler. It was really great to fly with Emirates. The staff were very friendly good food and it exceeded our expectations. My only regret was not to use the same airline to fly back to London.,Promoter
SYD-AKLO-SYD September 2014 Return trip on the A380. Both flights about half full. Food good particularly on return leg and staff were welcoming. They were happy to provide passengers with additional drinks beyond the trolley service with dinner on the return leg. Entertainment fantastic and undoubtedly the best (had flown on Etihad in business the week before and struggled to find things to watch). Flight back to Sydney was 25 minutes early. If they were like this on all their flights then they would deserve a 5 star rating.,Promoter
Flew MAN-DXB 26 Aug. Ordered Bassinet seat due to 1 under 2. Flew with 2 young children. Given this disappointed at activity pack.

Satisfactory.,Passive
Travelled London to Dubai. Aircraft in excellent condition didn't feel the plane rattle during take off and the landing was perfect. Arrived at destination on time picked up luggage and was out of the terminal 15 min later. Great selection of onboard entertainment that I ended up watching 3 movies throughout flight. Nothing extraordinary with food but as flight was not a long haul it was enough to get by. What I felt was the deal breaker was the rudeness of FAs who didn't give a toss about customer service. A request for water didn't come until a quarter of an hour and only after another reminder met by a glare. When it did the FA (another one) poured too much and spilt some on me but she was in a rush to push her trolley to even say a word of apology. The FAs in my cabin section were hardly smiling and didn't make efforts to put their passengers at ease. Why were they so grumpy and ill mannered?,Passive
We have been flying for Emirates for four years and the service is still amazing. My last flight was DXB-MNL in Business Class. It was a log-haul flight 9.05 hours. This was the first time I've experienced Business Class and it was superb! The seats were lie-flat the crew were (very) friendly and tried to keep you well-fed the IFE System is still excellent and the Lounge was very good. Definitely going to fly with Emirates again.,Promoter
We flew economy from Paris to Sydney via Dubai. It was my first time flying with Emirates so I was unsure what to expect. Everything was great! Great seats which recline enough to relax in economy. Enough TV shows and movies which kept me entertained and for my wife who prefers things in Arabic there was also subtitles on mostly everything for her. What we did do to make things a little easier was the first leg Paris to Dubai I purposely selected a flight with the 13 hour layover so we left France in the morning arrived Dubai around 8pm. Explored the shops visited the spa for a massage then stayed in the Airport Hotel over night for our connecting flight the next morning. It was the first time I had done it this way normally just allowing 2-3 hours wait between flights but then usually you are so tired on that second flight you sleep and in economy its not the most comfortable which ever airline you choose as you are not in a lie flat bed. So did that and left the follow morning for Dubai to Sydney. This was a long flight though entertainment system is fantastic. The food for me was nice though my wife did not like any of the hot food. All in all it was a great flight and I will fly with Emirates again.,Promoter
August 11-12 flight EK127 and EK335. The crew gets sloppier and sloppier! We've flown MNL-DXB-VIE and the crew seemed to react more to a Pax with two Infants rather than one? We didn't get anything for my Infant and the other seat got something? They didn't even ask how old my infant was. All in all I think the service was not as good as always. The crew from DXB-VIE was very slow and seemed so busy that you didn't want to request anything.,Passive
Flew London to Bangkok via Dubai. London to Dubai was reasonable no complaints. Other than I had the only seat with the inflight entertainment not working. However the service staff reset this and it began to work. Good choice of films. The entertainment also includes sport TV shows latest movies movie classics and music. The food was good - I had salmon for starter with a yoghurt chicken and sticky toffee pudding. The best flight food I have had. The breakfast wasn't bad either. The seats weren't too good though - slight lack of legroom. Dubai to Bangkok started slightly late but made up the time. Nice choice of newspapers and magazines for in flight use as well. Food on this leg not so good but still reasonable. I had a fish curry which was quite edible. I cant really comment on value for money as I paid for my ticket as a RTW flight so I didn't know the cost of this ticket.,Promoter
ADL-DXB-LHR. My first time flying with Emirates and enjoyed the journey Boeing 777ER. Check-in was quick and efficient as was the boarding. We were seated in row 19 AB for the flight to DXB. Nice and comfortable seating the in flight entertainment is excellent as was the food and service. We arrived in DXB on time and had a 2 hour layover before our flight onto LHR. The LHR leg was on the A380 in row 43AB. Once again boarding for us was quick and efficient the flight was smooth and the cabin service very good along with the food and beverage.

Monday 25th August 2014 EK 776. DUR to DXB have been Skywards Gold for many years always had good to excellent service on Emirates. This flight however was one of the worst. Food service has always been prompt after takeoff to allow pax to sleep and breakfast left to the last minute. 2 hours after takeoff and food was served many pax asking for main or asking for table cloth etc. to be removed. Throughout the night there was constant noise from the galley banging of plates crew talking loudly leaving curtain open (I closed it 3 times). Breakfast served 2.5 hours before landing so total sleep time was about 3 hours (normally I get 5 to 6 on this flight). Friend in economy said no breakfast was served and every time he asked for a drink it never came. Hope this is not a sign of things to come.,Passive
I fly Emirates as often as I can and if they had a route from Heathrow to JFK no one would fly either BA or Virgin to NY. This week I flew BA to Dubai for business and Emirates back (only because it was last minute and Emirates was full on the way to Dubai). I flew business class and was upgraded to First just as I was walking on board the plane. It was a complete surprise but they really look after both their silver and the gold card members very well. BA does nothing of the sort. The plane was clean the food superb the staff lovely. It honestly is one of the best experiences in flying on earth and they have really got their product right. It puts their competition to shame. Well done Emirates!,Promoter

Flew from BHX to Hong Kong (via Dubai and Bangkok) in August 2014. Now after 15 odd long haul flights on Emirates over the last 4 years I can safely say they are not as good as they used to be. The tired old 777 from BHX to DXB was awful the entertainment didn't work the crew were grumpy and the food was tasteless. I must say the A380 from DXB to Hong Kong was a vast improvement apart from the crew. I appreciate some passengers can be tricky to control when they stand up during taxing and landing etc but other passengers should not be able to hear attendants be very rude about them to their colleagues.,Passive

Flew ADL-DXB-BHX return on 777 all the way. Seats felt smaller (not sure if they are) and the service was below average. I had to ask numerous times for a drink on the long let the seat belt signs were on for 8 hours so I could not help myself to water but they did not bring trays of water/juice around regularly either. Everything seemed to be too much trouble. On the return leg from BHX-DXB the flight was not full and many women with children moved away from their sleeping husbands to sit next to other customers who were probably hoping to curl up on the extra seat. They allowed their children to claw the hair of passengers in front and change channels of those behind. They were not asked to return to their seats and one even changed a nappy on the seat and at no time was approached by cabin crew. The food was fairly awful and I was forgotten for over an hour when they ran out of my choice (though I was happy to have anything). It wasn't cheap $2400 AUD return but they are direct from Adelaide.,Detractor

"19th August GLA-DXB DXB-MRU. Poor experience at silver skywards check in glum emirates staff when asked about upgrading (paid) to business class told ""speak to someone at the lounge"". Upstairs at lounge was told ""there are 4 spare seats but you booked with a company so it's difficult to upgrade you"". After 10 seconds of silence I put my credit card away. Upon boarding I was told ""no seats in business class"" despite what lounge said. Flight great FA's a mix of good and poor food and drink good IFE good.

DXB-JFK on the A380. Boarding and departure was delayed by nearly an hour due to the late arrival of inbound aircraft. Seats were comfortable but worn out. No footrests but legroom was great especially at the back of the plane when it started to curve. Entertainment system as expected is simply the best in the industry. The choices of movie shows music and cool things like exterior cameras is virtually endless. However this was the only exceptional part of the flight. Flight attendants with the exception of one or two looked exhausted disinterested and frankly very rude. I've never encountered such bad mannered and grumpy flight attendants. I've had wonderful and memorable crews on domestic flights here in the United States and the crew on this flight was just a disappointment. Service calls were constantly ignored and service was extremely slow. It took them more than two hours to serve dinner that the sun already rose so it might as well be called breakfast. Catering was another disappointment while the quantity is good the quality and choice is disappointing. Omelette or scrambled eggs for breakfast? So basically it's a choice between an egg dish or an egg dish. Also the bathrooms were filthy and the cabin was a disaster. Only good part was the cool mood lighting. Overall it was a mediocre flight the hard product is competitive but Emirates' customer service from ground staff to flight attendant is just inconsistent and most of the time cold and unfriendly.,Passive
Flew CAI-DXB-CAI Boeing 777-300ER on all sectors. Outbound was first day of Eid loads in Y could not have been more than 60 people. Very pleasant flight cabin crew friendly and efficient. Hot towels and a menu with 2 options lamb kofta or chicken. Seats were okay for a 3 hour flight but definitely not as comfortable as on the Qatar Airways or Egyptair 77Ws. On return flight baggage was slightly over the 30kg allowance and the baggage drop agent asked us to shift some stuff onto our carry-ons. While I have no problem with EK enforcing the 30kg rule it did seem odd as the plane was going to carry the additional 2-3kg anyway and in the end the carry-on was taken by a gate agent to the luggage hold before boarding. Cabin crew were friendly and welcoming at all times and promptly responded to passengers' requests. The service and EK Y product is what really makes a difference and of course the added advantage of flying non-stop as opposed to connecting.,Promoter
"I recently flew from Singapore to Melbourne on a Boeing 777. On the plus side the fare was extremely cheap - $79 for a round trip ticket. The food was good and the entertainment system was enjoyable - especially the selection of movies. It was an overnight flight though so I didn't use the system much. The cabin mood lighting during ""sleep"" periods was also relaxing. On the negative side the seats were quite uncomfortable and I could not recline the seat enough to attain any sufficient degree of comfort to rest. Admittedly I was travelling in Economy class but I have no trouble reclining the chair enough to fall asleep in economy class of most other major airlines. Unfortunately the Emirates chair stopped short of achieving a comfortable level of relaxation and I was only able to doze fitfully. The other thing I was disappointed with was the service. Emirates provided stickers to instruct the crew to wake us up for certain events (such as meals DFS etc). I used the sticker to instruct the crew to awake me for meals. However they did not do so. The service was also not the friendliest - though that could probably be due partially to the timing of the flight when the flight crew are undoubtedly tired too.",Passive
"Flew EK384 BKK-HKG today my first Emirates flight in 2 years. Every time I fly this airline I swear I never will again - things have not improved. The planes are good but the cabin crew are just horrendous. Without doubt Emirates is the rudest airline I have flown and they are not improving. Instead of asking passengers to do something they demand it. Instead of asking if people would like a landing card they say ""where are you from?"" I think in the entire flight I heard one please or thank you. I really don't care if they don't enjoy their jobs but it would make for a pleasant experience for the pax if they weren't abrupt surly and clumsy. I've flown economy and business and in all instance staff attitude has been absolutely appalling. For completeness the flight was also an hour late although compared to the staff this was only a minor annoyance.",Passive
Flew Sydney to Istanbul return in May and August. Booked through Qantas but didn't set foot on a Qantas plane. As a codeshare passenger you are a second class citizen. No online check-in and no seat selection you get what's left at the airport. An unnecessary stop in Bangkok with even more unnecessary duplicated security checks even we were just stepping off the plane then back on again. Flight and food were good though I always score the entertainment system that doesn't work they were able to move me to another seat (I wasn't able to sit with my wife anyway). One whinge Emirates (and other airlines) really need to police their hand luggage policies. I'm sick of having my reasonably sized cabin bag under my feet because some selfish person has put a suitcase in the overhead locker. Hand luggage is for what you need on the flight not overflow from your check-in bag.,Passive
Traveled SIN-DXB-BCN and MXP-DXB-SIN on Economy. On the flight outbound nothing special besides the connection in Dubai the filthy and overcrowded toilets in DXB which is still not up to the standard of Changi in Singapore or HKIA and the wifi that I could never get going (and I wasn't the only one). On the flight DXB-BCN on the 380 they ran out of cold beers and had to serve warm beers declined the suggestion and opted for red wine which was also warm so I just asked for a glass of water hoping this one would be fresh. There seemed to be friction between the FA's as I was waiting for the toilet one was scolding the other in front of the passengers didn't look very professional. On the way back from MXP we got a remote stand and were transferred by bus. Nowhere to sit people sitting on the floor toilets were filthy and overcrowded. Managed to get to my gate (after a long walk) and boarded the flight. Nothing special the meal trays seem a lot skinnier than you get on Singapore Airlines or Qatar. FA's doing their job and that's it nothing like Thai Singapore or Cathay they are young but not very service oriented. And last but not least they lost my bag. I am not happy with the whole experience it is value for money because it is cheaper than most airlines but don't expect a whole new dimension it is just an OK airline with good value for money and an average service an extremely good brand positioning and an overrated self-attributed reputation with below average delivery. Business Class doesn't look anything special narrow seats on the 777 and if you're on the middle section you will be seated 3 abreast.,Detractor
"Bangkok-Hong Kong-Bangkok. I take this round trip fairly regularly. I love the A380 especially the on-board bar where I spend most of my time! I think the Emirates lounges on the ground are the best. However the flight on 20th August Hong Kong to Bangkok just did not gel. The business cabin was only a third full and there seemed to be more flight attendants than passengers. A decent time after seat belt sign was switched off we strolled back to the bar and had a pleasant drink and snack. We were then told (and not too nicely!) that if we wanted to eat we would have too return to our seats. Fair enough but I wish I had forgone the dinner presented and stayed with the snacks. My prawns with noodles was atrocious. The noodles were a dry tangled coagulated mass and impossible too eat. My companion's chicken was similarly inedible. Are these business class dinners cooked and prepared in Dubai 24 hours before? They certainly seemed to be. After dinner back to the bar where with one hour to go before landing we were told by the attendant that the bar would be closing in 10 minutes and it did. And no further service even to the seat with 20 minutes to go before even the captain announced the descent. Weather perfect no turbulence. I just had the feeling the entire cabin staff were in a ""couldn't give a damn"" frame of mind. This was disgraceful. On no other Emirates flight has this happened. I was very disappointed.",Passive
This was my first flight on both Emirates and the A380. Neither lived up to the hype. Emirates is trying to build a reputation as a premium carrier with budget prices but ultimately they failed in some crucial areas. The food was sub-par especially on the HKG-DXB leg where it was downright inedible. Flight attendants were reasonably efficient but neither particularly friendly nor very welcoming. The layover in Dubai was simply too long at 4 hours but the A380 requires extra time for transfer which brings me to the second major issue with Emirates. The A380 is a cattle carrier I will never fly again. Emirates loves those planes because they can fill them up and maximize profits with sheer volume of passengers. There are inherent flaws like the lavatories behind the cockpit that have staircases leading to them. This causes unnecessary risks and inconvenience to passengers. Another problem of course is that moving that many passengers requires extra time and increases the risk of delays and other mishaps. After an 18 hour journey we had to wait for an infuriating hour at the baggage carousel in MUC. This experience was repeated by friends who traveled on the same route a few days later. Even efficient HKG couldn't move the baggage in an acceptable time frame. For me that was not only the first flight on Emirates and the A380,Passive
Flew round trip from Houston to Dubai in August 2014 seated in economy class party of four. Seats are fine but cushions are on the firm side. Inflight entertainment was very good several choices of things to watch across several categories. Children enjoyed their flight having found several movies to watch received their food first with colorful cutlery had their pictures taken with flight attendant hat etc. The adults suffered from what seemed to be lacklustre customer service. Attendants were professional but seemed somewhat inexperienced,Passive
Excellent trip all round. Flight EK 373 from Bangkok (BKK) to Dubai (DXB) then only 1.05 hour wait to transfer to EK039 (Airbus 380) to Birmingham (BHX). Flight attendants were superb. EK373 when serving food the attendant asked if I'd like a drink with my (pretty nice) meal so I asked for a gin and tonic - 'Would you prefer a double sir?' was the reply! Then as she was leaving she said 'Oh I may as well give you another one while I'm here save me coming back'! Great stuff! On her return to collect the tray she asked if I'd like a glass of wine 'to help your food go down'. I agreed so she then said 'Oh we only have half bottles will that do? In fact while I'm here I'll give you two so you don't go thirsty'. EK 039 to Birmingham (Boeing 777) was an excellent flight with great service yet again. On my return EK038 from BHX (777) the flight attendants were somewhat less attentive but perfectly adequate. However (and this probably was why the flight was much cheaper than normal) there was an 8.05 hour stopover at Dubai where signage and facilities were not as good as expected. However the practising of a youth orchestra and a girls choir in departures was delightful and a nice surprise which whiled away some empty hours. EK 370 from DXB to BKK was fine again the attendants not as attentive as on the outward leg and there seemed to be about 20 of them! However service was quite good although some attendants seemed to be on autopilot at times. All in all Emirates lives up to its reputation and I was more than happy with the experience. The 8 hour stopover in Dubai was a bore but that's what happens when you get a flight Â£400 cheaper than normal I suppose.,Promoter
RUH-DXB-MRU arrived a few hours ago. EK818 I left Riyadh last night and my flight arrived to Dubai on time. The seats were good and comfortable seats though the width is sort of small. It was a 777-300 2-3-2 configuration. Food was great! The Lounge at Dubai T3 was rather disappointing. Very busy there was some noise from the passengers outside of the lounge the internet was horrible it didn't even work because the network was overcrowded! EK701 DXB-MRU on an A380 and I had my expectations up because I've heard a lot of good things about Emirates Business class seats on the A380. The cabin wasn't full which was good (for me at least) the seat width was pretty tight because of the drink bar in each seat. Flight crew were really nice. The onboard lounge was really nice the food was good and I met a few passengers on the flight with me which was a good experience. Turbulence hit which was really strong and stayed for some time so I was sort of stuck in the lounge for some time but I was busy chatting with the crew and passengers. Flight arrived on time. This is my 1st time flying Emirates and I had higher expectations but it was OK. I would fly again if I had to and didn't have any other alternative.,Passive
AMS-DXB-SYD. Both legs on A380 booked business class upgraded to first on DXB-SYD. Emirates offer top-notch one- stop connections to Australia and their partnership with Qantas provides for great fares when also adding domestic flights to one's trip. I flew SYD-BNE and BNE-PER on the same ticket and flew PER-DXB-AMS inbound. Emirates business class on the A380 in my opinion beats SQ and CX. Great seat excellent IFE bar is very pleasant on long flights good connections at DXB. Was also upgraded to first for PER-DXB-AMS on 77W which is also a great plane to fly. Business is better on the A380 but first offers the same suites on both airframes. Emirates is very reliable and offers great value for money. Food is maybe not 5* but I'd rather have a good schedule excellent seat and great IFE.,Promoter
ADL to DXB. Slow boarding and no separate lines for First and Business. ICE System had to be re-booted halfway through the flight. Business class about 70% full and still the steak dish was unavailable. Only had the choice of the other two spicy dishes. Disappointing regarding meal availability for business out of ADL. Meal table in the Business Class seat not working correctly. Slow drink service on take off Business Cabin Crew seemed new and unsure. Business class to Geneva a few weeks prior was of a much higher standard.,Passive
MEL-CPH B777-200ER return and had a great experience. In the air warmly greeted and escorted to our seats great food and attentive service. Seats were comfortable screens were large and staff were looking for opportunities to serve. First Class lounges in Dubai are terrific. CPH 1st lounge not so. Where Dubai is spotless and easy to find in both terminals we used the CPH lounge floor was poorly signed with dirty carpets. SIN was closed outbound which was a minor inconvenience. Overall this is our second trip with Emirates Business and I would definitely travel with them again.,Promoter
We flew on an Emirates ( Qantas codeshare) Sydney - Paris - Sydney. I strongly advise anyone contemplating this option to forget it. The flight goes to Bangkok where you spend 1-2 hours on the tarmac/transit lounge with the 'joys' of the dual security inspection at Bangkok airport and the usual scam of your duty free bottles etc being confiscated unless you have made the necessary arrangements before hand. Then to Dubai (another couple of hours). The total is close enough to 27 hours from Sydney to Paris. The return flight was worse. Late take off from Paris (unexplained delay nearly two hours) tushed transit in Dubai then a late take off. Then the Bangkok nonsense (and the inevitable late take off). And the food option s- if you don't eat chicken then a diet faces you. Chicken featured as one of two options on every leg every meal and complemented the chicken 'appetiser' - of course you could have chosen the Asian style fish - not an attractive dish.,Detractor
"I've travelled several times on Emirates nearly all within the Gulf region short economy class flights all fairly decent. This was my first Business Class ""long haul"" London - Dubai then Dubai - Dammam in economy as Business class was full on that sector. I have to say the reality doesn't live up to the hype. The lounge at Heathrow is nice decent selection of food. The flight was full and that told on the cabin crew who looked tired. Inflight entertainment was the best part of the journey. The seat wasn't as comfortable as some carrier I've used the food just a little above the economy standard and the wines middle of the road. No amenity bag toothbrush and razor are in little plastic bags in the toilets. Arriving at Dubai I went to use the Business lounge before my onward connection but was refused access as my onward connection was in economy. Other airlines I've travelled allow access if you have travelled inward on a Business ticket. All in all an average Business class experience but not as exceptional as the publicity would make you believe. Oh Sorry on the onboard bar was a nice touch if only it hadn't closed so early.",Passive
I flew from Washington DC to Ho Chi Minh City 20 hours in economy class. I find Emirates to be quite enjoyable! The in-flight entertainment is excellent with the latest music and movies and TV. The food is excellent! I would travel with Emirates again just for the food. The only negative is the seat comfort but hey you get what you pay for with economy. Toilets are clean and staff are friendly enough. Definitely recommend. I also stayed overnight in Dubai at the Copthorne Airport Hotel and I'd recommend that too.,Promoter
SEA to DXB. Boeing 777 business class. The actual experience did not live up to all the hype. Had business class seat in Row 8 the bulkhead. Rather than an A/V screen as part of my seat my screen was bolted to the bulkhead. Made for poor viewing experience. Also found the handheld controller to be ridiculously slow. Getting from my window seat to the aisle was a mountain goat experience when the adjacent seat was in sleeping position. Was also surprised to learn the 777 seat was not a 180 degree fully lie flat. Staff were pleasant and attentive but not any more so than British Air or Lufthansa. Food the same as BA and LH. Emirates arrival terminal in Dubai is excellent!,Passive
DXB to SIN. Airbus A380 business class Dubai to Singapore. Far superior to the Emirates 777 business class seat. Fully flat seat. Loved the walk-up bar and personal refreshment center at my seat. Once again staff just so-so and not better on average than British Air or Lufthansa.,Promoter

The worst economy flight I have had. The seat was good but the legroom wasn't. The IFE was very nice lots of German movies. Staff were awful. The flight FRA-DXB: Flight was 35 minutes delayed. After take off: Flight attendants went off for about 30 minutes! On our other flights: DXB-SGN: 3 hours delayed SGN-DXB: 1 hour delay. Staff were very slow. They walked 3 times trough the cabin but they didn't see the reclined seat the open seat belt and the fold down table. My bag was on the seat and not in the overhead compartment. The food was good but I will never fly again with Emirates.,Detractor
July 25 2014 from Hong Kong to Dubai on EK383. I always travel economy class with Emirates. Amongst all the airlines I've travelled they are one of the best in customer service punctuality fairness seat comfort etc. I'm extremely picky when I travel and so far I have not found a chance to complain. My only concern during a couple of the flights (2/10) was that the inflight entertainment monitor could not get adjusted very well.,Promoter
June 13th EK433 BNE-DXB with overnight stay at Transit Hotel and on to FRA with EK 45. Boeing 777ER. At Brisbane Airport plane missed turn to active Runway 19 and had to be pushed back resulting in 45 min delay. Apart from that delay everything went well. Unfortunately Emirates still has the 3-4-3 configuration which makes for extremely cramped conditions. Food and Drink service was efficient and even service calls were answered promptly. Toilets were kept clean. In Dubai I stayed at the Transit Hotel and was greeted by a Porter as requested. That is a great service they offer. I would have had big problems finding the hotel. Highly recommended if you need a rest from your travels even though a bit on the pricey side. Next morning after a good rest it was on to Frankfurt.,Promoter
EK 088 ZRH-DXB 17th July 2014 Airbus A380. What a difference to the B777ER. Wider seats and more legroom plus a big TV screen. ICE worked to a treat and can keep you entertained on these long haul flights. DBX-BNE B777ER. Cabin crew were attentive on both flights but food offered was nothing to write home about. Will fly Emirates again but try to get on the A380 first even if I have to go via Sydney or Melbourne to Europe.,Promoter
27 June 2014 HYD-DXB EK 529. 28 June 2014 DXB-HYD EK 203. I have been travelling EK between US and India since 2011. One of the best aspects of EK is that they keep changing their products which makes the passenger experience exciting. This time it was a whole new experience on the A380 between DXB-JFK: the food is simply superb the presentation style has changed - better trays and plates a mini-snack bar with crackers and dips food quality and quantity are great the ICE continues to exceed my expectations and it was lovely to watch it on ipad style 12 inch HD screens with a smooth-touch screen remote! The flight between HYD-DXB on B777-200LR was good older IFEs even with 3-4-3 seat configuration it was comfortable [I am 5'5] but the food was simply excellent! I love the fact that EK gives a hot towel lime water [on flights between DXB and India] a menu card and stainless cutlery for Economy. However it would be nice if the flight attendants could learn to smile more but they always seem to be in a hurry. Overall EK is the most enjoyable way to fly!,Promoter
I did the long haul from Gatwick-Dubai-Bangkok-Sydney in economy for all but one leg when I was in business class. I tried to upgrade the other sections five times over three weeks and was given the run around each time including at the airport three hours before departure. Turns out the plane was full on every leg so they could have saved me time and angst. The crew in economy looked unhappy without exception and were overworked and brusque. Seat comfort was what you could expect - but narrow seats made sleeping very hard. Luckily my fellow travellers were sanguine about the heat stuffiness and general mayhem. Not an experience I want to repeat especially after they lost our bags.,Detractor
Flew economy with my wife Sydney to Dubai 17 July and Dubai to Barcelona 18 July. Both flights flawless. Food definitely edible trays cleared away promptly tea and coffee served after the meal when the trays were being collected. Drink runs every hour or so. Snacks available at each galley during flights. Arrival into Barcelona nearly an hour early but only downside was that baggage took some time to arrive on the carousel. Inflight entertainment superb with huge selection of movies and TV programmes.,Promoter
Flying from Hong Kong back to the UK on flight EK383 on Thursday 17 July our flight was delayed due to bad weather for four hours some time was made up and arrived in Dubai and the flight EK021 to Manchester was still boarding.

Return Biz class ticket purchased with EK from Muscat to Beijing. On arrival at DXB airport following the flight from Beijing with a 3 hour wait - barred from using the EK Business lounges in Dubai and told that as it is a code share on the last sector (EK ticket) I would not be able to use the Emirates facilities at Dubai airport but must instead use Oman Air! Staff on the business lounge desk most unhelpful. Following a very long walk through DXB airport to terminal 1 no Oman air lounge was found so option was Gulf Air - who (unlike Emirates airline ground staff) were extremely helpful and friendly! Note for the future - avoid flying Emirates business class if possible!,Detractor
EK161 DXB to DUB on 16 July and EK384 DXB to BKK on 17 June. We still look forward to a decent experience on Emirates that I have read about here on airlinequality.com. Interestingly people I have recently spoken to have also shared negative experiences on Emirates - I guess we have just been unlucky. Inconsistency is clearly a problem. Some of our sectors were on Qantas and we found the service to be of a much higher standard on Qantas and they were also more family friendly than Emirates. Ultimately we don't have massive expectations in terms of service in economy on any airline but Emirates service was dismissive at times rude and you had to beg for basics like water. I travel on a variety of airlines for work and the Emirates service was similar to that of a very bad US airline. Anyway we arrived intact with all luggage accounted for so not all bad. Would avoid if possible in the future.,Detractor
QF10 for LHR-DXB connecting to EK380 from DXB-HKG. For the second part of my flight the Emirates A380 experience is just slightly overrated. To start with you could tell that some of the cabin crew were experienced and some were just very new to their job one tried to help a passenger climb over two seats for a toilet run during meal service but were quite clumsy when she dropped the tray of food entirely spilling everything on the aisle. Nevertheless it was evident that the cabin crew tried very hard to impress. What was annoying was the amount of commercials they had on their video screens - other airlines just have safety demonstration videos prior to takeoff but theirs include videos on Dubai the ICE entertainment and skyawards which was slightly unnecessary. The food quality wasn't as good as what was offered aboard Qantas but was still satisfactory. Even if Emirates have been praised over and over again I think it still needs to improve its service consistency and still is not in the same league with airlines such as CX and SQ.,Promoter
I flew AKL-MEL-DXB-JNB with a minor stop in DUR due to OR Tambo Airport (JNB) being closed due to severe weather. Wheels up at Auckland as EK407 at 6.00pm on an Airbus A380 for a 4 hour flight to Melbourne. The food on the first leg to MEL was excellent. It was Mediterranean chicken. We were in MEL for 1.45 hours to fuel up and pick up/drop passengers off. The second leg was 15 hours to Dubai from Melbourne but with the great in flight entertainment systems and comfy seats the time flew past quickly. Early morning arrival into Dubai at 5.20am then for a 5 hour wait to catch flight EK763 which was a Boeing 777-300ER. Great flight until we hit severe turbulence over the middle of Africa. We dropped a couple of feet which was scary but the EK staff kept us calm and served us refreshments after the turbulence had past. Just before we were about to descend into Johannesburg we were diverted to Durban due to bad weather in JNB. We were in Durban for 2 hours but we weren't allowed off the plane. But the EK staff were excellent they gave us refreshments and they were mingling with the passengers. Highly recommend flying with Emirates great seats (economy) in-flight entertainment systems are excellent and the staff are impeccable. I flew JNB-DXB-SYD-AKL on the way back home with the same excellent service.,Promoter
NBO-DXB-SGN on 20-21 July 2014. Travels on Boeings 777-300 and 777-200 respectively. Flights on time. Wonderful service from ground staff throughout. Smooth hotel stay (all inclusive) provided and perfectly arranged by EK in DXB due to long transfer. I was only dissatisfied in DXB with a 40 minutes bus ride from aircraft to gate in the middle of the night - unbelievable and extremely tiring. On board: FAs of superior kindness alertness and professionalism. IFE outstanding. Food: Special meal provided. Other passengers were provided with three options all of acceptable quality. Many soft drinks available. 3 options for beers but all industrial waterish and with a boring taste. Wines tolerable there were 2 red wines in mini bottles and 1 white-wine. DXB-SGN was another tiresome new bus ride for 45 Minutes (including a stop for 20 minutes standing as planes were taxiing. Economy cabin was completely full. Food even better than on the previous flight including special meal. Drinks very generous. Staff did well despite a very crowded economy cabin. Too many seats squeezed in (3-4-3 configuration) which make extremely narrow aisles which hardly can accommodate a trolley. Compared to Qatar Airways Emirates appear to be regaining the lead as (apart from DXB bus experience) they are overall more professional even to customers without status cards.,Promoter

Brisbane - Auckland return on A380. Used online check-in both ways and service was great. Completed bag drop very quickly and efficiently in both directions. This was my first return flight Bris-Auck on their A380. Had travelled Dubai/Heathrow Auck/Bris prior to this. Not disappointed. Flight time a lot quicker than 777 and A340 previously used on this route. Boarding was as quick as the smaller aircraft. In the past I have avoided seats in front of the bulkhead however found. Row 50 has plenty of space to recline which avoids disputes with the passenger behind and also gets you off the aircraft quicker.,Promoter
We have traveled 8 international legs with Emirates in the past 16 months so we have had a good opportunity to check out this airline. It is our experience that they are so focused on their business and first class customers that they do not care about economy despite the huge number of passengers that they cram into economy seating. Food takes so long to be served to economy customer that if you are seated towards the back it is cold once it eventually arrives. It is also our experience that you can expect to have you dinner tray on your tray table for at least on hour after you have finished. Service other than for meals is almost non existent and economy is severely understaffed. Legs out of Dubai to Sydney are particularly bad and the check in processes in Dubai simply terrible - long queues and slow processing. Inflight movies limited. Every time we have flown from Dubai to Sydney there has been a huge hassle with our seating despite having booked our seats months in advance. One time my husband and I were not seated together despite having been allocated seating together - they gave our seats to a sporting group. It is our opinion that this airline does not care about economy class customers. We have flown with many other airlines so have a good idea of the basic standard that one would expect in economy and in our opinion Emirates does not meet event the most basic standard.,Detractor
Flew 2 weeks ago from Ho Chi Minh city (SGN) - (DXB - transit) - LHR (London) and back. My first time flying with Emirates. I was served with a hot towel and was able to watch my a film during take off. After flying for 5 hours I needed my bag with me. Unfortunately it was in the locker which was too high for me to reach so when I saw a flight attendant pass by I asked her if she could help. She helped me open the locker eventually but her attitude left me disappointed! On my way back from DXB to SGN I was lucky to have a lovely flight crew. In general the on board entertainment was very impressive. Even though the hot meals were served quickly they didn't taste good the food was incredibly salty and I couldn't finish it. The desserts on the other hand were the best amongst airlines.,Detractor
A recent trip to Europe with Qantas/Emirates involved three legs with Emirates and one (Dubai to Sydney) with Qantas. Two of the Emirates legs were OK but the leg from Barcelona to Dubai was not up to any realistic standard for economy let alone business class. The food was barely edible (my wife's was inedible) and the service was appalling. No tea or coffee offered after the meal and resentment shown when my wife asked for some. They basically left us alone except for serving the meal. three previous flights with Emirates have been much better. other aspects of the flight (on time check in etc were fine and the Dubai terminal is excellent). The Qantas link with Emirates also works well if flying into Europe without having to go through London. Saves a lot of time.,Detractor

Quick trip to London last weekend. First time on Emirates and not the last. Haven't flown for a long time due to illness and the impatient and entitled behaviour of passengers was disappointing to see as the crew has a difficult job already trying to navigate people's expectations. I have nothing negative to say. Check-in was a breeze each way. Food was fantastic and plentiful. Travelling with children can be stressful at any time but saw crew assisting them and parents with respect and care. Am travelling long-haul again twice in the next 3 months.

SYD-DXB-DUB. DUB-DXB. I have mixed feelings about Emirates. I was very impressed with the efficiency of meal service and taking up the trays when finished (some airlines leave you waiting for ages). On the other hand on the Sydney to Dubai leg the crew were very straight faced and wouldn't crack a smile. It was as if they had a timetable of stuff to do and any other communication was an inconvenience to them. A cabin crew member was very rude pushing by me as I was waiting for the bathroom and she did not excuse herself. I asked for a second wine when all meals and clean up etc. had eased off and was left 40 minutes waiting and had to search out the guy I asked. From Dubai to Dublin was the same experience minus the wine. Food was awful - stale rock hard croissant was included in the breakfast. On the way back I had trouble with my travel agent booking and the ground staff in Dublin were very kind and helpful. The Dublin to Dubai leg was very enjoyable - crew seemed happy and engaged with passengers and food was slightly better that my trip from Sydney to Dublin. I would recommend plunger coffee - Emirates serve instant. Each plane was very comfortable. I could stretch out - I am 5'7' and my partner is 6ft and a large build. We were very impressed with the comfort on both the a380 and the 777. Entertainment was my lifesaver.,Promoter
"Flew Emirates for the 4th time and the in-flight experience keeps on getting better and better! After flying thrice on-board Emirates between the KHI-DXB sector in the past my recent trip with the same airline consisted of two sectors: KHI-DXB-IST (EK601 & EK123) and IST-DXB-KHI (EK 122 & EK600). Aircraft's were their B777-300(ER) which I love although some people might find the 3-4-3 configuration to be a little cramped. The B777-300(ER) aircraft's operated on the two flights during my inbound journey (A6-ENO and A6-ENI) were some of the latest in the fleet and their seats were equipped with the all new ICE Digital Screen which consists of a 12"" IFE Touchscreen and a touch-enabled remote control.

I have flown with Emirates on and off for the last 10 years and have enjoyed great service over the years and seen a lot of improvements. My most recent flight was LGW to DXB on the A380. This plane is great and the bar / lounge is a must not just a gimmick as seen on other airlines. My only negative is that the meal service has been steadily declining over the years. First the 'As You like It' menu disappears and now it seems that to obtain a glass of wine with your meal you have to wait until you have nearly finished for the wine to appear. Its the little touches that make flying Emirates a pleasure but they need to be maintained otherwise Qatar and Etihad with their dine on demand will gain more business.,Promoter
BKK-DXB-HAM. BKK-DXB Morning Flight EK375 - long check-in queue but check-in staff at Bangkok were friendly. Delayed 30 mins due to waiting for all passengers to finish boarding. A380 full but still roomy in Y (great aircraft) no highlight - same experience as inbound flight in May - very slow service. As the lunch tray arrived to my row it was cold - quality and quantity under 4 stars airline standard. DXB-HAM on EK 61 (B777-300ER) flight full/ no more to say about the feeling of 3-4-3 seating. On this flight the crew was very rude inexperienced and the poorest inflight-service I have received on EK - very chaotic no system. Crews forgot which seat rows they have already served drinks to and which rows they had not. After meals passengers sitting in seats A to E were served drinks tea or coffee twice while the left hand side passengers (F to K) did not get any. Hours later crews noted this mistake during the collecting of meal trays as the coffee cups were unused and it was too late to serve as we were on landing process and no apology came.,Detractor
Flew on a round trip from Jakarta to Newcastle via Dubai. Once again I was not disappointed flying Emirates. The cabin crew are attentive and have an excellent attitude. The food and entertainment system are the best in the business. Previously queues at Dubai airport security checkpoint for transit passengers could be a nightmare but this has improved drastically with the introduction of a 'snake' queuing system. I was through security in less than 10 minutes while in transit. The only things that could be improved by Emirates are: 1) It could remove the 10-abreast seating arrangement in Economy class on its 777 fleet and switch to a standard 9-abreast arrangement as seats are currently too narrow. 2) A snackbox on the galley similar to that of the British Airways 'tuckbox' would be a useful addition. Nevertheless Emirates will always remain one of my first choice airlines based on my experiences with them so far.,Promoter
We arrived in London Gatwick for our 13.35 flight to Dubai to be told that the flight was delayed 6 hours and would not take off until 19.00 so we asked to move/change our connecting flight from Dubai (knowing that we would have missed it for sure) but were told multiple times that it could not be done in the UK but it would have been done quickly in Dubai airport transfer desk. When we arrived in Dubai airport all the serious problems started as we went to the infamous transfer desk and found more than a 1000 people crowded into a small space with no proper queue. Only 2 Emirates staff were available. We stood queuing for about 6/7 hours with no refreshments and in a very warm environment. Communication was very poor and we had no idea how long the wait would be. At around 12/12.30 so after nearly 6/7 hours (standing queuing sweating with no water or possibility to go to the toilet) we were finally moved onto another flight leaving at 23.00 (further 11 hours wait) we were handed out only 1 food voucher each even if we had to wait 18 hours inside Dubai airport and although we waited so long Emirates were unable to offer us a hotel room or even a lounge. The food vouchers were used for breakfast but when we went back to ask for more vouchers for lunch/dinner we were told that they were all finish so We had to pay for our own lunch and dinner. Worst customer service ever lack of communication lack of organization and lack of care for customers. Definitely would not recommend also Airline refuses to compensate blaming natural causes when they had more than a day to prepare for all the delayed planes to arrive and the fog was only the day before for 2/3 hours.,Detractor

Flew in Economy on both legs and have to say that I was very impressed by the cabin crew who were extremely helpful and friendly on both flights and did an outstanding professional job in looking after me. Food was adequate and very tasty. Planes very modern clean and safety was paramount and the pilots were very exceptional on both flights informing everyone of the route turbulence etc. ICE was very good with plenty up to date movies to keep everyone entertained.

ABJ-DXB-SIN June 22nd-23rd. Good experience overall. Emirates staff improved its service since our previous flights one year ago. On board service is good beverages offered very regularly including on night flights. Food and snacks are excellent. IFE was excellent on the Dubai-Singapore leg but quite average on the Abidjan-Dubai one. Both legs were on B777 and the 3-4-3 seat configuration is quite uncomfortable especially for a 2 times 8 hours journey. But the main setback remains the transfer at Dubai with this incredible and uncomfortable 20 min bus drive from the plane to terminal 3 a bit problematic if you have a short time connection and have to queue to security check and walk across those long corridor to reach your departing gate something Emirates whose traffic is mostly longhaul transited through this Airport should fix.,Promoter
Flew BCN-DXB on 23/06 in an A380. Comfortable roomy. Excellent IFE although I didn't avail myself of the myriad of choices - too many violent films. I found that the controls are not all that user friendly (flying to/from Europe). Pleasant staff. Food was fine. Arrived Dubai 00.50 am (24/06) and we had 70 minutes to transfer to our connecting flight. When I requested a priority transfer whilst checking in at Barcelona the staff member was disinterested and unhelpful. It took a lot of fast walking and anxiety but we made our 02.05 am connection DXB- ADL. The Boeing 777 made me realise what cattle class is. Cramped and the seats are appallingly uncomfortable. For the 12hr journey we were served breakfast and lunch hot pizza snacks were handed out only to awake passengers. Chocolate bars and fruit were readily available. Very pleasant staff. The toilets were kept pristine on both legs - very impressed. Aisles in the Boeing are very narrow so that when one is walking for exercise or to the toilet one is constantly bumping other passengers. In our hurry to get our connecting DXB-ADL flight my husband left our camera in the seat pocket of the A38! We spoke to the site manager on our arrival in Adelaide (24/06) and gave him the necessary details. The next day (25/06) I received a call from the Emirates office in Adelaide Airport to say that the camera had been located and that it would arrive on the DXB-ADL flight on Thursday night. So professional so helpful.,Passive
First class on this brand new A380-800 from New York to Dubai is truly an excellent flying experience. From the time you board to the time you disembark in Dubai you would never know that you're traveling with 500 other pax! I'm always amazed how Emirates is able to create such an exclusive travel experience in first class while also meeting the demands of the other fellow passengers on the plane. The private suite is spacious the personalized service exceptional the IFE works very well. And then of course there is the shower. Just after take off you book a slot for your pre-arrival shower and this does make a difference after a 13+ hour flight for you walk off that flight feeling refreshed and clean and smelling good.,Promoter
I have had 2 return journeys with Emirates to the Seychelles via Dubai from Heathrow within the last 3 months (EK002 & 3) and from Dubai to Seychelles and back and I have to say I was really shocked at how under-performing the cabin crew were. On those separate four journeys I found the Cabin Crew miserable sarcastic rude and looking like they really would like to be anywhere other than where they were. In a nutshell I have left the planes on each occasion really rather appalled at the lack of customer service and I have no wish to fly again with them anytime soon. On one of the flights food was almost thrown at us and scrambling to find anything to give to us as we were last rows of seats on my most recent flight back from Dubai the stewardess just before landing said I will be back (she was collecting blankets and headsets and checking seats were upright etc) but we never saw her again. Air Seychelles I have been told don't fair any better but on my next trip I shall be trying them out flying from Paris direct to the Seychelles which they start from July and see how they do compare because I really don't want to fly Emirates again!,Detractor
Flight from Newcastle to Brisbane via Dubai and Singapore. We booked in August with Emirates staff promising seats that would be allocated for me being disabled I have severe walking problems that require me to be able to stand up and stretch my legs. What I got were seats in row 37 seats D and E just getting to the seats was extremely hard as I need to use a crutch to walk with the aisles are too narrow to move to the seats while using a crutch.

Flying the A380 from Hong Kong to Dubai in business class you wonder if there is really any point to pay extra for suites given the amazing product that Emirates has in biz class. This was a new A380 with the improved biz seat and a great IFE system. This flight was pure perfection. Well done Emirates.,Promoter
Unfortunately Emirates used an older 777-300ER on this 14+ hour route which is a shame. The biz seat is not entirely flat - the ever so slight angle still makes you slide down when you sleep. I would have preferred to see them use a newer 777-300ER on this route with the full flat bed and place this equipment on a shorter route where sleeping is less important than on an ultra-long haul route. Besides that the service the food the IFE are superb and live up to the Emirates standard.,Promoter
20/6/14 EK88 ZRH-DXB. Boarding very orderly by zones. Pretty new aircraft of 1.3 years old. 85% Full flight. IFE as usual very good with ICE being top notch. Too many things to watch and do. There's even a customer service survey under the C component. This time drinks came with salted biscuits 40m after take off. Dinner service 2h30m after take off and drinks came 30m later. This left many passengers parched and kept asking crew for drinks which they weren't very happy to oblige on this leg. There was no menu as well not sure if crew forgot or there was insufficient. Dinner was really good with choices between salmon with saffron risotto and grilled chicken breast with mashed potatoes. I had the latter. Chicken breast a little dry but went well with the sauce. My mother had the salmon and the risotto was really delicious. Dessert of lemon torte was really good and I could have had multiple servings. Drinks service was really generous and there was no limit on the number of drinks both alcoholic and non alcoholic that you could take. Staff service was terrible on this flight the worst flight out of the 4 legs I flew with them. Hardly any smiles during service which honestly does not matter call buttons by other passengers went unanswered. No drinks service after the meal service. I went to the galley to ask for my bottle to be refilled and they obliged. I asked for 2 boxes of playing cards as souvenir and a rude male crew told me to get back to my seat and ask for it later. Not recommended this time. On a positive note a family of passengers who ordered Indian vegetarian meals didn't have their meals loaded and a female cabin crew were extremely helpful even going to business class to get a sandwich for them.,Passive
13/6/14 EK71 DXB-CDG. Boarding very orderly by zones. Sparkling new aircraft of 0.6 years old. Full flight. IFE as usual very good with ICE being top notch. Too many things to watch and do. There's even a customer service survey under the C component. I didn't like that there were no drink runs done after take off not even a tray of drinks like what SQ and CX does. Snack service 1h after take off and drinks another 30m later. Snack consisted of a roasted chicken sandwich and chocolate chip pecan cookies. Breakfast was really good with choices between omelette with creamed spinach and scrambled eggs with hash browns. I had the former. Omelette didn't taste like airplane stuff creamed spinach really good. Fruits were fresh too. I like that they provide croissants in addition to normal bread made me feel like I'm in France already. Drinks service was really generous and there was no limit on the number of drinks both alcoholic and non alcoholic that you could take. Even during breakfast drink service you could ask for alcohol and no questions asked. Staff service was really good on this flight the best flight out of the 4 legs I flew with them. Smiles during service call buttons answered promptly and drink trays brought around after meal service for people who turn thirsty quickly like myself. I went to the galley to ask for my bottle to be refilled and they even asked me to sit down and they'll return the bottle to me. I asked for 3 boxes of playing cards as souvenir and they obliged as well with a smile. Excellent service beats SQ on this leg. EK is really good if you get an awesome crew like this.,Promoter

Dinner service 1.5 hrs after take off and drinks another 30m later. People's throats were parched by then. People then begun pressing call buttons this could have been avoided if a simple drink run was done. Food was really good with choices between sweet and sour chicken and beef with mashed potatoes. I had the former and dessert was good too. Drinks service was really generous and there was no limit on the number of drinks both alcoholic and non alcoholic that you could take. No drink runs nor snacks provided after that although menu said so that was disappointing so 1 star less for F&B.,Promoter

Too many things to watch and do. There's even a customer service survey under the C component. I didn't like that there were no drink runs done after take off not even a tray of drinks like what SQ and CX does. Due to this passengers kept pressing call buttons to ask for drinks. Snack service 1h15m after take off and drinks another 30m later. Breakfast was 3h before landing. Snack consisted of a roasted chicken sandwich and chocolate chip pecan cookies same as DXB-CDG. This time the sandwich was rock hard and the cookies weren't as good they were soft and weren't baked enough. Breakfast was really good with choices between omelette with creamed spinach (Same as DXB-CDG) and fried noodles with siewmai. I had the former. Omelette didn't taste like airplane stuff but was more bland this time creamed spinach bad this time. There were also fewer potato wedges and they were soggy. Fruits were fresh. I like that they provide croissants in addition to normal bread. Drinks service was really generous and there was no limit on the number of drinks both alcoholic and non alcoholic that you could take. Even during breakfast drink service you could ask for alcohol and no questions asked. Staff service was good on this flight. Smiles during service call buttons answered promptly and drink trays brought around twice after meal service for people who turn thirsty quickly like myself. I went to the galley to ask for my bottle to be refilled and they obliged. Landing was smoothest of 4 legs. After landing during disembarkation I requested to a cabin crew to allow me up to business and first class to have a look. She asked the chief stewardess and got a nod. She then enthusiastically showed me around the upper deck and I was amazed at how luxurious it was. I thanked her profusely after that. Good service from her.

Vastly overrated. The staff may be good at delivering food but have very little idea of what service means. I did 5 sectors in first and met one Purser and one person who claimed to be in charge of the first class cabin. On two sectors I was addressed by my name on three I was just another person. Staff seem to not want to engage with passengers or communicate with them except to take food orders. On two sectors I had to go and search for cabin staff - none seemed to be around when found they were all talking in the galley and appeared upset that I had interrupted them. As best I can determine there is only one first class lounge and that is in Dubai all the others are business class shared with first. On the plus side the suites are great and the beds excellent.,Passive
Upgraded from Economy to Business SYD-DXB on A380. Sydney lounge is one of the best around with respect to the food and wines. Best breakfast lounge menu ever. A380 business class seat superb rivals Cathay although I'm not sure why it needs touchscreen + handset + tablet to operate the IFE. That said it all worked seamlessly and very good quality screen. Food was fantastic from the main meals served to the in between meals (a highlight) to the finger food in the lounge at the rear of the plane. The lounge is fantastic - it sets them apart from the other high quality business offerings pity it's only on A380s but then they have a massive A380 fleet anyway. Staff were great but a little over friendly at times. Will be my first choice from now on.,Promoter
DXB-CDG and NCE-DXB-SYD. Great economy class with comfortable seats great IFE quality food (particularly impressive) and very good staff. Difficult to fault. Lounges are mixed bag DXB terminal C for breakfast wasn't great but plenty of space Nice airport lounge is very average but better than nothing DXB terminal B for dinner on the way back was fantastic. Very happily fly with them again. Saw staff taking Polaroid's of couples on the 777 from NCE to DXB and then giving them as a gift (I think) - very unusual but thought it was quite a nice touch.,Promoter
Flew Copenhagen-Dubai-Seoul and back. The seat in economy was rather large. The food was quite good - not the best I've had on a flight but definitely not the worst. There was apparently no limit on how many drinks and snacks you could ask for - a major bonus especially on long flights. There were lots of movies on the inflight entertainment and many of the English-language movies also had subtitles which is really nice because it's difficult to hear everything due to the noise from the engines.,Promoter
Flew to Los Angeles in April. Food on the 04.30 am flight from Bangalore to Dubai was terrible as usual. The flights on the double decker A380 aircraft from Dubai to LAX and back was very comfortable. The massive queues to board the aircraft long queues at check-in and the scramble for the baggage at LAX airport will deter me from choosing this aircraft in future. It took me 2 hours to get my baggage at LAX airport and with 500 pax searching for their suitcases it was a total mess! Food portions on the flight were very small and food was disappointing. For a 16 hour flight the in between meal snacks were just fruits and chocolates which vanished soon and were never refilled. The crew were unfriendly. Ask for a drink and it never comes until you remind them thrice. Very disappointed. The food on the Dubai/Bangalore sector was excellent.,Passive
"More food please! On a trip from SYD to London we were only served 2 meals and one ""light bite"". That's over 23 hrs flying with just 2 measly meals. Meal service is appalling.

No second round of tea /coffee served Service is slow milk and sugar need to be requested and served separately and this takes forever By the time tea is served it is cold and too late after the meal has been eaten.",Detractor
Emirates has got to be the best value for money for any premium carrier. The pick up from home is excellent they will take you to an airport hotel the night before.

Recent trip with Emirates from DUB/DXB/SYD in First. I was going out to Townsville in Northern Queensland for about a week to help my daughter celebrate a big birthday. My wife had travelled out a week in advance of me and returned a week after me. Chauffeur pick up to and from Dublin Airport worked extremely efficiently. Travelling out on 27th May in DUB Emirates use the DAA lounge which is fairly basic with it's services. Hopefully in September when they increase their schedule to two flights each day from DUB they will have their own lounge. The four flights were all in general very good with respect to service comfort etc. The FA on the return from SYD/DXB was absolutely superb. The staff on the final leg from DXB/DUB were not quite up to the general standard shown on the previous flights. I have flown in First with Malaysian Singapore (a lot) and Etihad and I would certainly be happy with the Emirates product.,Promoter

I flew Emirates for the first time return Glasgow to Dubai. My daughter and I were extremely impressed by the comfort of the seats the quality and variety of food and the huge selection of movies etc offered on the IFE. We flew out overnight on 30th May and were looked after by a lovely FA who quite simply could not do enough for us. We arrived early in Dubai and were provided with Fastrack passes for Immigration. I have travelled to Dubai on many occasions (with BA KLM and Air France) and this was the best experience so far. The return (day time) flight was also excellent - again could not fault anything. Another fabulous FA - a young man this time - friendly and helpful. Ground staff in Dubai and Glasgow were courteous and helpful. One minor thing - if Emirates are serious about their commitment to Glasgow Airport they should establish their own lounge. This was the only downside of my experience - they do not have their own lounge in Glasgow - they have space in the ServisAir lounge which has to be one of the most soulless places I have encountered. Very limited choice of drinks no fresh foods at all (only packs of crisps!). Polar opposite is the lounge in Dubai - wonderful is the only word to describe it. It is large airy and offers free WiFi. Hot and cold meals and snacks available in abundance - and Moet and Chandon by the glass! Chauffeur driven cars were provided for both of us for the journeys to and from Glasgow airport (I was travelling from Edinburgh my daughter from Glasgow). Both my drivers were excellent cars were extremely comfortable and on time. I will most certainly be using Emirate again in the future.,Promoter
"We flew airbus A380 Manchester-Dubai and returned on the 777. Both planes were excellent and the entertainment system was 2nd to none. I found the seats to be adequate although I have read some concerns about the width we did not find this but both my wife and myself are average height and build at 5 ft 10"". We were however lucky enough on our return journey to have booked just 2 adjoining seats at the rear of the plane which we found really good as there was a bit more room at that point in the aisle as well and we were far enough away from the toilets not to be annoyed by any queue. However my only gripe would be the complimentary drink situation If you are happy to have a drink just when the food is served then its not a problem for you but my wife and myself do like a drink more often than this and class a 7 hour flight with great entertainment almost as one of our nights out (especially on the outward bound flight) Now I don't know what other people would say is over the top but I would quite easily get through 6 or 7 of the little wine bottles they provide in this period of time but found it hard to be served 3. I really did have to keep asking to get any more and on 2 occasions was acknowledged but no wine brought to us. I would have quite happily purchased some at this point but obviously its all complimentary so I couldn't even do this. I have a suspicion that the staff are trained to spot people who may want more alcohol than what they deem to be average consumption and enforce delay tactics to slow you down and felt they were avoiding eye contact with me when passing. They ignored the ""call service"" light on our seat completely and I had to eventually keep getting up and going to the galley where they were. This did spoil the flight to some extent as even when we are on a flight where we have to pay we would have had more than this The food however was again very good.",Promoter
Flight ok. SYD to New Zealand flight was late 30 minutes causing us to miss connecting flight. Was unable to get a response from them after 3-4 emails using the Emirates email given to meet the Emirates rep inside the airport. Finally got hold of someone on the phone who said she could not help me. So the flight and carrier were comfortable and pretty polite - unless you end up needing customer service for something. Then it's very difficult to resolve a problem.,Detractor
Flew Wellington - Sydney - Bangkok return. Having booked with Emirates legs were actually with Qantas (partner airline). This was made clear at booking. However Qantas schedule changed prior to flying which gave a very short connection in Sydney then the Wellington-Sydney plane was late but Qantas air hostess rang through and arranged for a buggy to meet me at the terminal and fast-track me to the gate for the Emirates flight. They closed the gate immediately after I arrived for my flight which I appreciated. However I was seated at the very back of my flight and knowing my predicament no effort was made to help me off the plane first to make my connection. I arrived in Bangkok to discover that though I had made the connection my bag had not and would not come for another 17 hours. The Emirates staff person at Bangkok informed me off this but gave no apology. They promised to deliver the bag to me but as I was two hours out of Bangkok and in a rural area my host had little confidence that a courier would actually make the delivery so we decided to come back to the airport ourselves to collect the bag. Effectively I lost a day and extra money for taxis etc and have still had no apology from the airline. I have flown several times with Emirates and am a member of their skywards programme and this is the first significant complaint normally they are very good.,Passive
"LGW-DXB-MNL round trip Economy. Excellent and very efficient Check-in at LGW and very generous 42kg baggage allowance for Skywards Silver. On time Departures and Arrivals for all flights apart from MNL-DXB which was 1.5 hours late in leaving MNL due to ""Immigration Delays"" for 15 passengers. Not Emirates fault as such but I'd have thought the Captain would have had a cut-off time with many more passengers (myself included) having tight onward connections in DXB. In fairness they made up 30 minutes en route. In Dubai passengers with tight connections on late arriving flights are usually gathered together and accompanied through the terminal and allowed to make their connection after the 45-minute cut off period stipulated by Emirates - usually. Cabin Service on all flights was perfectly acceptable but the seats on both the B-777 and A380's are not the best. Food in Economy was of a high standard with plenty of drinks choices. The IFE on Emirates is still amongst the best on any airline and eases the journey considerably. Good value on the ticket price and I'll continue to use Emirates as my first choice.",Promoter

Flight from Heathrow to Dubai very good on the A380 comfort service and entertainment all good. Changing aircraft at Dubai for Perth was appalling. Had to get 2 lifts a 6 minute train ride a 15 minute walk and then an 8 minute bus ride from the gate out to the plane and then a climb up a large flight of steps to the plane. Had no time to use the business class lounge as the transfer gate was so far from where the first leg of the journey arrived. This may have been due to all the construction going on everywhere at the airport. My advice would be to avoid Dubai if possible for at least a year until they are better organised.,Passive
AMS-CPT via DXB. Easy check in at AMS and departure area spacious and good control of boarding. Had rear row to myself so able to stretch out.

BEY-DXB-LHR Economy. Emirates continue to set the overall bench mark. Flawless crew and aircraft all on a very well priced ticket. But the food standards have dropped dramatically or should I say the product has somewhat become much cheaper and basic. This is a pity. Food on both sectors was only edible because people were hungry. I note that Alcoholic drinks are kept generally hidden from the public eye to perhaps give the impression that they are not available. The fabulous ICE IFE has somewhat shrunk too. But again they are probably the best overall.,Promoter
19th May CHC-SYD-BKK-DXB-LHR 31st May LHR-DXB-BKK-SYD-CHC. On all legs apart from DXB-LHR and LHR-DXB flew on 777-300er and on the DXB legs A380. I have to agree with others who have written about the cramped conditions imposed by the use of 3x4x3 cabin layout and the impact it has on both passenger comfort and cabin crew mobility. Of the two aircraft's I flew on I found the window seat most comfortable on the 777-300er curvature of the aircraft body interior on the A380 ate into what little legroom there was. The cabin crew for the most part was professional and good at their job however on the flight from DXB-LHR there was an issue regarding careless parents and a wilful toddler intent on roaming the aisle and not strapped in as we prepared for take off which an obviously inexperienced FA did not have the confidence to deal with. I found all food offered and on such a long series of flights there was a lot of food offered to be acceptable not amazing but acceptable and the drinks service adequate. If I asked for anything it was brought promptly and with good grace. On my return journey I had a crashing headache and had nothing to take for it in my carry-on. When asking if there was anything onboard for a headache a FA swiftly brought me two Panadol and a glass of water for which I was most grateful. I was pleasantly surprised by the hotel used for my Dubai Connect transit stop. I was taken to the Arabian Park hotel and having read some of the horror stories about the Copthorne I was pleased with my allocation. However it was not easy or clear where I was to go to at DXB to avail of the Dubai Connect offer as there is no signage for it specifically and it was trial and error that found it and not due to any help from staff at DXB. If I have any complaints at all about my flights they are mostly about some of my fellow passengers who seemed to go out of their way to make the rest of us uncomfortable and the irrational 3x4x3 cabin layouts. One of these things Emirates can change the other they can't. My final thoughts about my flights are this and one concerns the blatant disregard many of my fellow passengers had for the carry on baggage protocols. The lack of enforcement regarding carry on quotas results in overhead bins being so stuffed that some of us had no space to stow baggage of legitimate size and quantity anywhere near our seats. The other being the reliance of the IFE system to divert us from the cramped cabin conditions. Let's face it no movie is going to stop FAs bumping passengers in aisle seats or avert the ridiculous situation of a 3x4x3 cabin layout.,Passive

The staff were pretty scarce for much of these flights but they were responsive if you managed to get their attention. I thought it a bit unprofessional that they were often chatting and laughing at the back of the plane while the poor people sitting back there tried to sleep. On the last leg the plane was only half full and the service much better. But at least 20 screens weren't working at all - luckily there were lots of other empty seats to move to.,Promoter
LHR-DXB-LHR. First flight on the Emirates A380. Compared to B777 seats were wider but legroom felt the same. Flight was quieter and smoother than B777. Check in in LHR was good with no queuing and friendly staff. Check-in in DXB no so good 20 minute queue with certain locals known to Airline staff being allowed to jump queue. Check in agent did not smile once. Boarding on both flights very efficient with no queuing or crowding on aircraft or airbridge. Service on outbound flight no so good no drinks served until after meal only one trolley drink service and no breakfast or food before early morning 6.30am arrival. Long wait for trays to be collected. Service on return better with drinks service before and after meal and light afternoon staff. Again long wait for trays to be cleared. Adequate number of toilets on flights with no significant queuing. In flight entertainment superb with good quality screen let down by poor control sensitivity.,Passive
"LHR-DXB-LHR with Emirates both ways on A380. Aircraft is truly fantastic as we were heading away for a last minute holiday with our son we plumped for economy rather than business which we would usually go for if we had booked further in advance however the comfort of the economy seats on the A380 is superb and fine for 6.5 hours each way. Managed 4 hours sleep on both flights which is something of a rarity for me too. Unfortunately as I've always found with Emirates seemingly irrespective of class booked the cabin crew were absolutely terrible from start to finish on both flights. Bless them they look great in their smart uniforms and clearly only better looking examples are chosen to wear it. Sadly this comes with a built in 'chip on the shoulder' which I've seen on every Emirates flight (more than thirty) which I've taken over the past decade or so. Slow surly service was the order of the day on both sectors. On the outbound flight more than two hours after departure for a meal which for a flight departing at 2040 was very disappointing as it minimised sleep opportunities. Food nice and plenty of it. A request for a second glass of wine was met by a retort from a French stewardess: ""I have more than 500 passenger today so I get it when I can"". I replied that as she had 23 colleagues on board she needed only to worry about 21 passengers and had nearly seven hours in which to do it. Needless to say my wine was forgotten and I helped myself from the galley instead. Another member of cabin staff ignored my son completely even though he is more than capable of asking for his own drinks. On the way home a two hour ground delay due to passenger illness before departure was handled by the service of half full glasses of water only. Not impressive. Sad really because the aircraft and the product is very good. Just delivered very poorly. My airline of choice is BA.",Passive
We travelled from Heathrow-Dubai-Cape Town. The aircraft was a 777 all sectors this airline has to be the most uncomfortable and over rated. The seats were crammed in 3x4x3 so narrow and with narrow aisles to. The whole experience was exhausting. The staff were indifferent and you could tell they couldn't wait to get off and avoid the suffering stares from the trussed up passengers. I would suggest think long and hard before booking if the aircraft is a 777. I understand most airlines had 3x3x3 set up which is civilised. Food was ok TV ok and all on time. Transfer at Dubai ok nothing special though.,Detractor
LHR-DXB-HKT. Codeshare with Qantas on way out for first leg of the journey. Emirates for the 2nd keg and both sectors for the return. Very nice and able to use BA Business lounge at LHR. Had an excellent vegetable curry before the flight. Arrived at Dubai and followed signs for gate and Business lounge only to be told we were at the terminal. Signage was poor and quite a few other people made the same mistake. Phuket airport was confusing as the terminal is not well signed. Again business class so whisked through security and passport control so no need to queue. Coral Lounge at Phuket is very small and serves First and Business class it is also a lounge were you can pay to enter. NO wines or spirits are on offer was told to go outside and buy wine if I wanted it. The toilets are also a few minutes walk away from the lounge. Dubai again on way back and was told the gate was B16 (the terminal we were at). Luckily I noticed on the departure board that it had changed to A13. No announcement so not sure if anyone missed the flight as it entailed another shuttle train to B gates. New A380 plane and was very nice food etc all good as were the staff.,Promoter
EK751 Dubai to Casablanca on May 8th 2014. Using miles to upgrade from business to first class on a recent Dubai to Casablanca flight I was beyond disappointed in the product and the experience from what I had considered a world class airline eager to stand out amongst its strong rivals like Etihad or Qatar Airways. Not only was the cabin crew service rude and sporadic the inflight entertainment system was faulty the first class catering was not offered and the headsets were defective. And when all this was reported to customer service there was a very passive response to the feedback. This airline was once a star but it is definitely falling from grace.,Detractor
Flight EK 421 Perth to Dubai 6th May 2014. I have flown the Glasgow to Perth via Dubai route several times however this was by far the worst experience economy was full and as anyone that has flown on the Emirates 700-300 will know due to the 3x4x3 seat configuration how cramped this can be. For long periods of time sometimes up to an hour despite there not being turbulence the seat belt sign was kept on so people couldn't go to the bathroom despite cabin crew walking around freely resulting in long queues when the sign was turned off. It made for an uncomfortable 10.5 hour flight. Connecting flight to Glasgow was okay.,Detractor
My flights were EK16 LGW-DXB 26 May 2014 connecting EK384 DXB-BKK 27 May 2014. Ground staff both at Gatwick and Dubai were polite and friendly. Very quick and smooth checking in and boarding. Both flights were on time. Cabin crews were definitely helpful smiley and attentive. F&B were quite nice. I chose yoghurt chicken curry with rice from Gatwick and Chicken Congee from Dubai. Toilets and cabin were kept clean. Inflight entertainment with live news so many choices of movies TV shows games and music. Large individual screen though. My headset from EK384 DXB-BKK wasn't working but I got another one which was fine. It was my first time flying with EK and I must say everything was beyond my expectation. I'm absolutely impressed by their excellent services. Much better than Etihad's. Worth every penny. Highly recommended.,Promoter
HAM-DXB: Check-In Staff at HAM extremely rude. I had a long discuss about the weight of my handbag. EK allows strictly only 7 kg. handbag incl. Cameras Laptop reading materials umbrella. As per IATA rule those carry-on personal items can be carried free of charges into the cabin without weighing and counting to the handbag but not by EK. HAM-DXB on EK 62 (B777) late evening flight took off at 21.25 Hrs. Very cramped seats and very slow service I got my dinner served at 23.30 hrs 2 hours after take-off. After 5 hours transit at DXB airport for onward flight to BKK with EK 372 (A380). After boarding we were informed about the 2 hours delay but we were not allowed to get off the aircraft so had to sit in the full A380 (fortunately seats are more comfortable than B777) with no drink or meal service. During the delay crews were hidden and enjoyed talking with themselves in the galleys. After taking off with a 2 hours delay crews still needed another 2.5 hours before starting to serve meals to hungry passengers. Quality and quantity of food was poor. Only 1 drink was served 1 hour later. After 2 hours trays were collected with the offering of tea or coffee. Poor cleanliness during the flight toilets were not cleaned or controlled. I notified the crew that one toilet had run out of tissue but nothing happened.,Detractor
My spouse and I flew first class Christchurch-Sydney-Dubai-Frankfurt 16 November 2013. Our second flight on our return itinerary (outward from Frankfurt to Christchurch was also with Emirates in Business Class) Sydney to Dubai was cancelled due to a rainstorm at Sydney airport which meant we had to deplane after approx three hours on board and spend all night in Sydney airport waiting for our luggage to be returned and then re-queue to be re-booked on a new flight. It was an A380 so there were hundreds of people involved yet almost no Emirates Staff available or information provided. At re-check-in we asked to be re-routed to Paris rather than Frankfurt as we realised that the new routing to Frankfurt meant we would not be able to reach Brussels - our final destination by train connection the same day and so would have to stay in a hotel overnight in Germany. We made repeated requests to be re-routed and we knew there was availability in the first class cabin on the Paris flight. Yet despite all our requests nobody seemed prepared to understand our predicament or accede to our request. We also noticed that the level of service â€“ nd attitudes of staff - differed substantially across flights. While some were outstanding such as the First Class leg from Christchurch to Sydney (probably because we were the only people in the first class cabin) service on other legs was sometimes surly and when our problems arose on the return leg we had the impression that staff were more interested in keeping us quiet and fobbing us off than sincerely wanting to help resolve our travel dilemma. For example the Senior Purser onboard suggested we use their on-board WiFi and telephone service to enquire about being re-scheduled onto the Paris flight as it was â€œnot very expensiveâ€ - I later discovered a â‚¬50 charge on my credit card statement! Upon landing in Dubai we enquired with ground staff about changing to the later flight to Paris but Dubai ground staff shouted at us that we were obliged to take the Frankfurt flight as our luggage had already been checked through to Frankfurt and that we would have to pay penalties for changing our routing. So all in all we have at best mixed feelings about our Emirates Experience in-flight given what was supposed to be the trip of a lifetime in First Class but definitely disappointed at their mediocre response to a fairly simple request to be re-routed and lack of customer care afterwards. All-in-all we probably will not be travelling with Emirates again.,Passive
BKK-LGW-BKK. The aircraft are fairly new and in good shape as you'd expect. The service is very hit and miss mostly a miss. On one leg shortly after takeoff the crew distributed promising looking menu cards but this was just a tease since no food materialised until almost 5 hours into a 6 hour flight. The purser spent the flight in and out of the understair workstation adjacent to my seat on the A380 slamming the door each time. When the food did arrive it was poor. On another leg the food was served in the first couple of hours and was very enjoyable being salmon and mashed potatoes. They seemed quite happy to bring the odd glass of wine throughout all the flights. On one leg we were bussed to the aircraft at Dubai which was strangely parked in a very remote part of the airfield. All those gates at Dubai and we end up having a 20 minute bus ride and climbing steps to the aircraft. The customer service at Gatwick was very poor. Although the ground staff had all week to advise me of a requirement regarding my return flight (I visited their desk on several occasions) they failed to do so and waited until I arrived at check in with all my bags and then turned me away. If you have cause to contact Emirates with a complaint after you've flown they seem to be very reluctant to provide email addresses or forms for this purpose.,Detractor
Flight from Perth (Australia) to Dubai did not meet expectations. Despite the airlines supposed reputation the food quality and choice was very poor.

PER-DXB-HAM. My first experience with Emirates Business Class. Started very well with the Chauffeur car. Staff at check in good. Lounge nicely presented. IFE in my seat did not work. Luckily seat next to me vacant. Impressive looking seat was surprisingly narrow and no elbow room. Found it hard to get comfortable. No amenity pack offered on either sector all the way to Hamburg. Found it very difficult to choose something I wanted to eat. Food too middle eastern with no choice offered friendly crew. Lounge in Dubai awful. Probably the worst I've had for a while. Far too overcrowded. HAM-DXB-PER: Chauffeur pick up lounge nice but hard to find. Much better flight than outbound. Same issue with food although this time I ate in the lounge where the food had more of a western flavour to it. Staff friendly and helpful. Different seat with better elbow room. IFE is a little awkward to use. My bag was damaged on arrival in Perth. The baggage services team in Perth were very helpful and my bag was replaced. As a Qantas frequent flyer this was a rewards trip so I'm not too devastated by the experience. If I had to spend full price on a business class fare I would probably look elsewhere. The lounge in Dubai and the seats being the major turn offs.,Passive
CPT to LHR via DXB in economy. Two full planes Boeing 777 and A380. Staff excellent helpful and pleasant. Both arrived early or on time. Boarding done by row numbers and well controlled. Seating on 777 narrower but I found more comfortable than the A380. Entertainment vast and varied. Food ok. But why do airlines still insist on providing hot breakfasts in the very early hours which are so unappetising. My poached eggs could have survived a set at Wimbledon! And three hours before landing at 4am when I had just got off to sleep - surely no need. I can't believe passengers want this - a light and healthy snack 90 mins before landing would be more preferable. Going for fruit platter meals in future. Off loaded at LHR quickly and despite a busy terminal through immigration and customs within 30mins of landing.,Promoter
MAD-DXB-BKK Business Class (Frequent Flyer Gold Card holder) traveling approximately bi-monthly for over two years. I've noticed a marked deterioration in quality on this service and my last two flights have had problems which need bringing to the attention of a wider audience. I note from comments on this site that others have noted a similar deterioration in service on Emirates. On the first flight I was double charged by the airline. When I pointed this out to the Service Center I was initially told I was incorrect. After a second e-mail and a delay I was informed by another individual I had to prove that I had been overcharged. When I did this I was then told by a third employee to enter certain information via the web to obtain a refund. I tried several times but the information was clearly wrong. After a further delay a fourth employee suggested I was entering the data incorrectly. I tried again: same result. I then asked the matter to be escalated. No reply. Eventually after further e-mails a fifth employee agreed that the matter should be escalated. Over a month later I received an incomplete refund and a lame excuse for an apology. On my last flight EK385 the service was awful. My breakfast was initially not delivered. After trying to attract the attention of staff my meal some 45 minutes late was slammed down,Detractor
"SYD-AKL-SYD and SYD-AKL-SYD my work booked these flights. To say the staff are rude is an understatement. Onboard staff were only interested in quickly serving the meals and you didn't even have time to finish eating off your tray before they whipped them away. Any rubbish left over they weren't interested in picking up with their precious little fingers. I buzzed for duty free for an hour and asked 3 people if I could buy some and kept getting told ""I'll tell the girl I'll tell the girl"" or ""she should be coming through"" only to find that ""she"" couldn't be bothered. Ground staff at both airports were rude and I was looked down on (it felt) for a being a Qantas business customer. Rude arrogant staff.",Detractor

ARN-AKL via DXB and SYD in Business. Very comfortable lounge in ARN. Clean aircraft ARN-DXB with attentive and pleasant FAs but come across as a bit inexperienced. Slow drink service during dinner and food ok but not great. The Business seat a bit cramped for my taste. Had the Dubai connect service at DXB (because of a long lay-over the airline puts you up in a hotel arranges transport and visa for you) and that was great. Nice to have a good bed for the night in an excellent hotel. Immigration into and out of Dubai very quick. Lounge in DXB was excellent (have a hard time understanding all the negative reviews about this - but admittedly did not use washrooms or showers. Food was great). Flight from DXB to AKL via SYD in 380. Excellent seat. Again very pleasant FAs but again somewhat inexperienced appearing. Again very slow drink service. Was given a before dinner drink. Then no drink with the starter but with the assurance that it was coming. It came when the starter was finished. Then the main meal arrived but no drink. That came after the meal was finished. Those things are not the end of the world but it comes across as somewhat unprofessional. Lounge in SYD was fine with nice shower and flight from SYD to AKL had a new crew that seemed more experienced. Overall though I was pleased especially considering the cost was significantly lower than on competing airlines. So in spite of missing out on a glass of wine or two I will do this again.,Passive
Auckland/Dubai/LHR economy connecting flight EK 1 to LHR delayed at Dubai for over 1hr but no explanation given by ground staff in fact appeared unprofessional not until on the aircraft did you get an adequate response from the captain who gave a full explanation. By coincidence my leg from Heathrow to Dubai was also delayed exactly 2 weeks earlier so wonder if they have a scheduling problem. The A380 is a huge aircraft and with its size comes big logistics the cabin crew were not particularly attentive and water for such a long flight was offered very infrequently and the service was not anywhere near the service I had been given by Asiana Airlines to Auckland a year earlier.,Passive

This airline was not at all child friendly and we had many problems. The transit in Dubai involved a bus trip over 30 minutes long standing in a hot stuffy bus. Some of our kids were given activity packs on the aircraft and some were not. The allergy meals although not containing the specified allergen contained many other common allergens such as eggs fish and seafood. The meat for these meals was always fish. We did not receive the diabetic meal we ordered on every flight. Staff on the A380's are immature and more concerned with enjoying the trip themselves and their own comfort. No drinks were offered between meals on the return A380 flight. The crew spent their time gossiping in the service areas. Our flight on the return trip was changed and we weren't notified until we tried to check in. These are just some of the highlights but overall the experience was very stressful.,Detractor
"VIE-DXB after taking off the bassinet on the wall was installed quickly amenity kit distributed and even blankets with collectible monsters. When I asked the crew to fill up our babybottle with hot water this was done in less than 10 minutes. DXB-MNL the crew seemed very tired and unmotivated. I am just wondering why the ""sparkle"" of the crew was missing? Even at the flight back the crew was so-so at the first leg but at the second leg they tried their best. Emirates takes good care of their passengers food service excellent ground handling (handled by Austrian Airlines in Vienna) was great as the Supervisor blocked the seat next to us so we could rest better and I think its a big plus for Emirates that they lend Strollers in DXB to families.",Promoter
DXB-ARN-DXB. Biz class return In short both these flights were of a high calibre especially the return leg on the 08/05 ARN-DXB the Purser was an English lady who is a total asset to the airline. Her manner with passengers was professional yet friendly and she and her team gave an excellent service. Both legs service was top notch flights on time and arrived early. ICE as usual had the latest movies and seat comfort superb. My only small gripe again is the food Biriyani in Biz class is not acceptable I chose the Veal which was chewy and tough and had to return it. Wines were good.

I went from Dusseldorf to Singapore and back with Emirates. The service was great! One thing I really liked was that the cabin crew members were very open towards me. They weren't treating me like a customer but like a friend. The food was excellent as well and the seats were provided with TV's. There were lots of films and music to pick. The cabin crew also provided us with blankets before we started flying. This was excellent since I wanted to sleep immediately. To be honest I can't really say anything bad about Emirates.

Dubai - Male 22nd February 2014 Flight EK0652. On the morning of 22nd February we boarded the flight in Dubai at the correct time despite their being some fog in which cleared by approximately 10.30am. We were held on the plane for over 7.5 hours and then had our flight cancelled and were disembarked. Told that once we left the plane an Emirates attendant would be waiting to show us where to go. After we left the plane we went through the airport doors to be offered two options 'arrivals' or 'transfers' and no-one had any idea where to go and no help was available. We saw a few Emirates staff around and when we went to them asking for assistance they just shrugged their shoulders and said we had to queue up at the desk. We queued for 2 hours and when we finally got to the front we were told that no information was available and that we had to come back in 20 minutes! We asked about hotel accommodation and was told that all hotels were booked. The lack of communication was terrible no announcements made no apologies. Finally after an exhaustive night and at about 4am Sunday we were told that everyone would not be able to fly until Monday. This debacle carried on until about 5.30am when we were told that we were going to fly after all at 11am Sunday. The journey took approximately 42 hours which should have been a four hour flight. The absolute worst part was having absolutely no information forthcoming - it was an absolute disgrace.,Detractor
We were disappointed by the standard of the flight from Male to Dubai. The plane was old old entertainment system (not very responsive and outdated quality also the Arabic subtitles in large size could not be switched off) and all interior a bit worn off. One would not expect it with this airline. Food was mediocre at best and the preferred choice was gone before our row was served. Drinks (non alcoholic and alcoholic) were all fine though. Toilets: Two toilets out of soap relatively soon after the start of the flight. Not great also in terms of cleanliness. Floor: Worn off but mainly disturbing because staff did not collect / pic up plastic debris fallen on the floor during the flight. Main ground for disappointment was the broken tray (46G) preventing you from eating (nothing could be put on the tray without falling / sliding off). Staff apologised but in the end though they were friendly that does not take away the inconvenience and as the flight was full (at least in econ.) a change of seat was no option.,Detractor
London Gatwick - Dubai EK016 1/5/2014. Dubai - Kuala Lumpur EK346 2/5/2014. I have been using Emirates for several years and have found little to grumble with until recently. I have flown primarily between the UK and Far East transiting via Dubai. Fares have generally been cheap and the service and food has been passable. I was upgraded to Business class on a couple of occasions but really wouldn't rate it as being much better than Economy class. I flew with them in Jan/Feb 2014 and again on this current trip May 2014. I would have to say and in line with most other reviewers the service has gone downhill dramatically. Boarding the plane was organised and orderly in London Gatwick but quite haphazard and chaotic in Dubai. On both flights food seemed to be served in a chaotic manner. The stewardesses appeared to be a mixture of Qantas and Emirates staff and were often at odds with what each other was doing. They appeared quite stressed at times and were curt rather than polite with inquiries. Emirates staff have never been as polished or professional as MAS staff and from my observations a certain level of rudeness/frustration has crept in and is very noticeable at times. One of my biggest bug bears is that they no longer ask passengers to right their seats to enable people to eat their food in comfort. I quite often end up eating in an impossibly restricted space. Asking a Stewardess for assistance to rectify this is not always responded to positively. The choice of food doesn't seem to have changed for years and has become boring if not unpalatable at times. Travelling in Economy is no longer a pleasure and the term cattle class feels more apt these days. I stopped using Malaysia Airlines years ago because of the cost of their flights and poor service at that time. When I started using Emirates I began recommending it to all my friends because of the level of service and affordable fares. I probably will continue to use Emirates but would consider other options such as MAS Qatar Etihad and Turkish Airlines all of which appear to be doing well in the ratings. I certainly would have misgivings about recommending Emirates to friends at present.,Detractor
LGW-AKL in First A380 all the way. As usual an extremely good product extremely well delivered. Pricing out of LGW was more competitive than via LHR which is nearer my home but the included chauffeur service meant the added distance and time were negligible. The lounge at LGW despite being under renovation still served top-class food (as do most EK lounges worldwide) with an impressive Margaux to sip. Staff were very courteous. All sectors (LGW- DXB DXB-SYD and SYD-AKL) were excellent - slept reasonably well superb selection of modern films on the IFE high quality cabin crew. The shower spa is a fantastic luxury that I continue to thoroughly enjoy every time I use it - it's a real boon on such a long flight to be able to shower at the time you want to help adjust your body clock for your arrival. I'm not a fan of the First Class lounge in the A380 terminal at DXB it feels completely soulless and the shower was only lukewarm - the second time I've experienced this. The massage in the spa was good though. Return AKL-LGW was almost as good as the outbound. However the menu was limited and repetitive - lamb and chicken biryani on all sectors. Although there was also a pasta dish this was not really the level of variety and quality I expect when flying in First for more than 24 hours. Thankfully a bit of creative thinking with the starters (including the excellent mezze and generous portions of caviar) meant I was certainly not going to be left hungry. Simple things like freshly-prepared toast are also very welcome though I wish they would introduce ice cream. One slight niggle is that I asked for a large bottle of water when I boarded and was told there only 6 for the entire flight so I couldn't have one moments later another member of cabin crew came up and offered one oblivious to what I'd previously been told. Overall though cabin crew were even better on the return leg especially between Brisbane and Dubai. Boarding for the final sector B777 DXB to LGW was a farce and the one real let-down of the trip. I was called from the lounge at 0710 for an 0800 flight then had to wait for thirty minutes in two different holding areas until they could bring a special bus for the first class pax (frankly I'd rather have just got on a normal bus and been able to relax on the aircraft) which then took more than 15 minutes to crawl around the airfield. All in all though Emirates First continues to be by far my preferred carrier to New Zealand for its mix of quality service and cost.,Promoter

Been travelling Emirates for a year and on 3 occasions (all from London to Kuala Lumpur). Overall experiences have been good except for our recent flight last week. As before we booked our seats online but one of the seat was changed without our knowledge leading us having to re-booked/changed both our seats to one which we are unhappy with. Check in staff on the day was unhelpful. We will be flying again early June to Kuala Lumpur but will give Emirates a miss on this occasion as the protest. We will consider Emirates again next year.,Detractor
ATH-DXB-ATH. Arriving at check-in flight was overbooked in economy. They offered me an upgrade to business at 300 euros per sector. During booking business class price was 1300 euros so I stayed with J. An A345 the seat was comfortable and pitch just ok. Catering ok but really nothing special. Crew very attentive IFE the typical ICE on EK which is not my taste. Variety of movies limited. Flight arrived on time. Return a different story. Again overbooked flight and the same offer. Still on J class on a 777-300. Boarding and a bus ride that literally took 37 minutes. Nice tour of the airport! Flight departed with 30 minutes delay due to the bus ride as we got into the plane 5 minutes before the STD. Same thing on catering and seat. This time crew was a bit uninterested and robotic. Arriving in ATH and we have to wait for our bags more than 25 minutes. All in all an average experience. Next time and my schedule permits I will try Etihad or Qatar as their ticket price is a bit lower and inflight service seems to be better than EK.,Passive
Emirates had become my airline of choice because of the great seats and entertainment system on their new A380's. Until my most recent flights I also found their service and food to be among the best. However on my recent flights from HKG to DXB and DXB to Dublin I found both the food and service to be awful. Their switch to serving food in J class on open plates is a disaster. The food ends up lukewarm and dry. I much preferred the sealed container. The food was bland and tasteless. The cabin attendants on both sectors were pretty indifferent. On the second sector service was particularly clueless with wrong orders and lack of apology. I might just look for other options next time I fly. One thing also to bear in mind if you can avoid it - the HKG-DXB route flies over Bay of Bengal. Turbulence here as on my flight can be fairly rough during monsoon season. Also for some reason we had to be bussed to the gate when we reached DXB. The ground journey took 20 minutes. The place where we were dropped off happened to be the confluence between T1 and T3 and as a result a lot of transit passengers headed off in the wrong direction. A frustrating mistake to make at midnight when you are already tired.,Detractor
EK 413 AKL-SYD 13 April Business Class. Disappointing service and poor hospitality. Emirates appear to have lost their former sparkle. Problems started at the Emirates Lounge in AKL where numerous Qantas passengers were denied entry due to different rules applying to status levels and guests. Emirates staff looked particularly anguished dealing with the number of complaints they had on this occasion. The Lounge was full to capacity and it was difficult to find a seat with flights going via Brisbane Sydney and Melbourne all around the same time. However the food in the lounge is exceptionally good compared to competitor offerings at the moment. Onboard the business class standard on the A380 was poor in hospitality comparison to current competitors. Young inexperienced staff surprisingly lacking basic etiquette and manners. Staff looked tired and despondent. During the flight I was either served twice or not at all. Despite the new A380 I was surrounded with broken and depreciated equipment. Meal service very average. The staff just seemed to want to rush and close down the service as quickly as possible. The pricing is definitely competitive and if hospitality isn't important and you just want to nod off this could still be a good way to travel. For me the quality is just not good enough in hospitality for business class. Its not just about the IFE and the swish seating capsule. The outbound flight with Air New Zealand may have lacked the latest technology and wizardry in cabin design but made up for it in spades in terms of hospitality professionalism and overall comfort. Have used Emirates a couple of times over the last few years and couldn't fault them previously. Will avoid them for a while. Clearly lost something as I didn't feel looked after on this occasion.,Detractor
Birmingham-Dubai-Bangkok-Sydney-Christchurch NZ 19 January 2014. Economy. Nice food and good service. Birmingham - Dubai was a 777 (2 class) and we had bassinet bulkhead seats row 8 which gave lots of legroom. Dubai - Bangkok was the A380 which is super comfortable we had bulkhead behind seats next to the midships galley. There was some noise from the galley and there is a locker above the seats which is not great but we were comfortable enough. Bangkok - Sydney was with Qantas this was the least comfortable as plane was older. Although Emirates is Qantas partner you cannot pre-assign seats for Qantas flights so these were our least good seats. Sydney to Christchurch was again a 777 and not full so I again sat in row 8. I believe that Emirates does not make the (777 2 class) row 8 bassinet seats available until airport check in. If there are no babies needing them you can ask at the gate to move into these seats and if you are a frequent flyer you may get moved It worked for us.,Promoter
EK 418 - QF 8418 - Bangkok - Sydney. Seats - 17A 17B 17D 17E 17F + Bassinet for baby. 24/04/2014. When I saw I was Emirates coming back from Bangkok I was very happy as I had heard great things about them. In the end it was a disaster. Couldn't check in all the way through with my family at Phuket so had to wait until a desk opened in Bangkok then best part of 45 mins. Once on the aircraft we had been split up so cabin crew tried to sort this out but a very large person who had booked the seat insisted having it. It was sorted in the end but took a long time. As for the seats they where like rocks to sit on for any time. I was amazed that the cabins have large screen that keep coming on and off telling us here we are. One was directly over my 5 month old Granddaughter and every time it came on it woke her up. Even with the eye shades provided for passengers the bright light came through making it impossible to rest or sleep. Over all very disappointed.,Detractor
"On a recent flight on 22 April from Warsaw to Guangzhou via Dubai (EK180) I was upgraded to Business Class. Finally I get to sample the much advertised Emirates Business Class. The Business Class was full and so was the entire flight I assume. The welcome was the usual that you get with the welcome drink but none of the staff offered to take my jacket. After take off the bar service started quite late. There was a wait of approximately 40 minutes. The second round of drinks took ages. I had ordered a second whisky which the staff conveniently forgot. I had to remind to which I was given a curt unapologetic ""it's being made""! That too by the chief purser a lady in her 50's. During the meal which was nice the wine came only once. I had to remind the stewardess to fill-up my long empty glass. The staff was not well-informed about the plane either. I asked one if it was the new 777 to which she replied that she did not know. She never bothered to find-out and inform either. I can say one thing about Emirates. The hardware is there but the 'software' still needs to be updated. Staff training on customer satisfaction has to be intensified. I would not recommend anyone to buy the Business Class unless it's only for the additional comfort. Service is definitely lacking. Wonder what the First Class is like. Taking into account my experience in the Business Class I am certain the pampering is non-existent. Frankly I prefer Lufthansa. The service in all classes is very good and that keeps you aching for more.",Passive
Flew from Zurich to Tokyo via Dubai. The flight was efficiently handled. B777 on the way out was fine though the seating was not better than normal. A380 from DXB to ZRH had noticeably more seat space and was remarkably quiet. Meals were exceptionally good but service was patchy. Not everyone got coffee maybe the team needs to bring in some f/b to improve there.,Promoter
Flight EK050/EK705 in Economy Flight EK706/EK051 in Business. Used special EK offer for business class. From MUC to DXB and back A380: comfortable seats with enough leg room even in Economy! DXB to SEZ a very different story: A340-500 with really cramped seating in Economy seats in Business on SEZ to DXB are not lie-flat and not comfortable. Food ok on 3 legs but worse (with old bread) in Business on SEZ-DXB leg. However can not understand the policy of EK to serve breakfast on a night flight at 3am on DXB-SEZ leg in Economy whereas the C-Cl and First Class Pax could sleep. Crew in general were polite but seemed very unorganised with bad service in Business Class on SEZ-DXB leg: they just served coffee and tea after breakfast with no refills and no additional drink rounds or offers. Personally addressed in C only on the DXB-MUC leg but also forgot after dinner to serve coffee or tea and the chocolate to me and my wife. In MUC they had troubles fixing the airbridge at the upper deck which resulted in late disembarking of all C and F-Class pax so at the passport control all Y-Pax (almost 300-400) were in front while the priority baggage was already on the bag carousel. IFE as already mentioned before: wonderful but not working properly on DXB-SEZ leg.,Passive
Flew LGW to SYD via DXB then Perth to LGW. All four flights were on time and pain free. Able to book seats on all flights well in advance and choose rear doubles on 777-300s which gave additional space albeit with crew reserved seats behind. Caught up on most of the films I had wanted to see for the past 6 months and a few more beside. Very good quality meals with real metal cutlery provided. Rest rooms were kept clean by flight crew who were always available to offer service - although not too difficult when they are only just behind you! Love to get the chance to fly Emirates again. Wish they flew direct to USA from London!,Promoter
First problem on EK018 only 1 USB port worked between 3 seats. When I placed the food tray down there was remnants of the last meal and coffee stains all over it. EK805 delayed approx. 2.5 hours combined with delay in immigration caused me to miss my connecting flight in Jeddah resulting in a 9 hour wait for a place on connecting flight. I arrived at my destination in Medinah 12 hours after I was supposed to. EK802 delayed 1.5 hrs from Jeddah. I ordered Asian veg meal but was served an omelette with sausage. EK017 delayed 15-20 mins causing me to miss my train which I had booked before travelling. The food on the outward journey was very bland but on the flight to Manchester was wonderful. The only consolation is I was travelling alone and not with my family.,Detractor

MAN-DXB-HKT in business. Excellent in every aspect. Picked up at home by driver lounge facility at Manchester were most impressive. Comfort levels on 777 were very high and better than on the A380.

Dubai - Brisbane. We were incredibly lucky to find our economy cabin only half full so were each able to have a row of seats to ourselves and could stretch out and relax/sleep. Cabin staff were wonderful. We had just come off an Emirates flight from Paris to Dubai where the cabin crew bickered and insulted each other so were pleasantly surprised to have friendly and helpful crew on this leg. Food was good. Drinks were provided regularly throughout the flight. Toilets were kept maintained. Staff were attentive and came promptly if called.

MUC-DXB-JNB - Very good experience. Great A380 and Boeing 777 clean bright and colourful inside good seats. Wonderful entertainment on flights. Great food and drinks. For veggie very good meals (asiatic and lacto-ovo). Nice the idea of the menu printed for each passenger and the stickers to put on seat to remind staff to wake you up if fallen asleep during meals time! A sweet fragrance applied to the cabin before departure pleasant! The service quick and complete. Crew members very helpful smiles in each circumstance and well-instructed. Toilets often cleaned up. We had a great sleep with the little lights on the top of the cabin and awoke with soft orange pink lights in the early morning.,Promoter
Fortunate enough to fly EK without going to Dubai flew MEL-AKL-MEL aircraft on both ways were the A380-800 very good experience on both ways both on time.

EK503 Bombay to Dubai newest 777ER300. Left around 15 minutes late but arrived on time. The newest 777ER300 had the ultra-modern ICE (Information Communication Entertainment) System with touch-enabled extra-wide screens. Remotes were looking like Ipads. State-of-the art InFlight Entertainment system. The aircraft was new and looked very clean. Everything was in perfect order. There were star like mini-lights on the passenger walkway ceiling which gave a calm effect. Ground crew were very helpful and answered all queries. The Cabin Crew were extremely helpful friendly and responded to all requests very quickly. Unlike other airlines Emirates has very comfortable seats with plenty of leg space in Economy. The Business and First class portrayed infinite luxury never seen before in any other airline. The food was very appetizing. The food is selected according to the flight route which means that the food is selected according to the cuisine of the departure and arrival cities. I had the Chicken Biryani and it was the tastiest Chicken Biryani I have had so far!,Promoter

EK20 MAN-DXB overnight on 25-26 April (B777-300ER) connecting with EK863 DXB-MCT on 26 April (A330-200). The chauffeur service arrived promptly at my home and as always was immaculately turned out. Our drive to Manchester was made tedious by heavy Friday traffic but the driver handled everything calmly and with good humour. At the terminal I was checked in swiftly and 20 minutes later was in the Emirates lounge (this included time spent picking up some last-minute purchases). Boarding was on time and the flight left slightly early. After watching a film and enjoying supper I got 4 hours solid sleep waking up about 50 minutes out of Dubai. We landed a few minutes early and it took only 20 minutes including the security check to get to the gate for my connecting flight despite this leaving from Concourse C and the arrival having parked right at the end of Concourse B.

NCL-DXB-DAC-DXB-NCL. Departed from NCL on newest 777-300ER with newest ICE system flight very full but experience was overall pleasant. Catering from NCL is generally always good there was nothing to complain about and staff were efficient and generally good if not over-friendly. Flight from DXB-DAC was on time and again very full on older 777-200 with older ICE system. Cabin Crew on this sector were excellent however and even checked in on my mother who had been upgraded to Business Class for us. Toilets in ridiculous state given 4 hour flight but again due to clientele rather than crews fault. Return was on Christmas Eve and surprisingly busy flight from DAC-DXB. Return flight is always over-timed by an hour - meant we didn't get on to the plane until an hour after arriving at the gate. Flight was on newer 777-200ER with newest ICE system. Cabin service was efficient and brusque if not necessarily very friendly and inflight catering was ok. Arrival into Dubai was early and the airport was very quiet - we had a wait of more than 4 hours for connection to NCL - so collected our complimentary food vouchers from transfer desk. DXB-NCL unusually on 3 class 777-300ER with newest ICE system. Cabin Crew were unusually mostly British due to a lot returning home for Christmas break. Catering was disappointing with choice particularly breakfast offering but otherwise pleasant. Arrival into NCL was late and held on tarmac for rather unusual amount of time before being parked at remote stand and bussed to terminal. Baggage out promptly. Would use again based on this experience - the sector DAC is never an easy one and on the whole Emirates made the experience rather more tolerable than it can be and the price was incredible value for money especially long-haul from a regional UK destination.,Promoter

BHX-DXB-KUL. Probably the worst long haul flights I have had. Emirates seems to have deteriorated considerably since my last trip in 2010. Outbound flight was spoilt by passengers who wandering about the cabin visiting friends/relatives at all hours of the night and were not controlled by the cabin crew even when seat belt signs were lit. Although things were better on the return legs staff seemed generally disinterested and demoralised. Food service was very slow (over an hour to serve breakfast). Drinks were served after the meal rather than before. Altogether a very disappointing experience.,Detractor

Where EK fails miserably is on ground staff sometimes rude and not really concerned with passengers experience and well being Late departure from CDG (accepted) which meant missing connection in DXB although promised that we would make (unacceptable) and late departure from DXB (unexplained) which meant missing connection in HKG and refused access to Lounge for 12 hours wait.",Detractor
I've flown Emirates on a regular basis for 8 years and up to 2 years ago I had no real problems and planes were never delayed more than 5 or 10 mins. However in the last 2 years I have increasingly experienced delays which coupled with the ludicrous different terminal and concourse situation at Dubai has led to problems in transfers at DXB. My last two trips LGW-DXB-Bkk involved 4 sector flights each and in those trips only one flight was on time. Last night I flew DXB to LGW on a A380 (500 passengers) arriving at the boarding gate 45 mins before departure I saw that boarding had started and majority of economy passengers had boarded. I was told there was a delay so better to wait in the business lounge. Only one announcement was made. No further announcements or information given. 70 mins later a large Indian tour party (40 persons) arrived at the gate and immediately a final call for boarding was issued and the flight took off. Clearly the flight of 500 persons was delayed to satisfy the tour party. Talking to fellow passengers at DXB on the plane and at LGW it seems the reliability is slipping. The service on board is hit and miss and in fact last night's service DXB-LGW and the LGW ground support was the worst I have experienced.,Detractor
I'm a regular traveller albeit mainly short haul. When visiting friends I wanted to experience a flight on an Airbus 380 in Business. Big disappointment but waited to form an opinion until after the return flight. In my view there are just too many business class passengers to cabin crew and it is just not possible to get the level of service you expect from a business class flight. Significantly inferior to other aircraft configurations. Food quality was poor and you are left without being asked if you would like a glass of wine to go with your meal. By the time they arrive the meal is finished. I would recommend you avoid this if you want a high level experience. I usually try to fly via Doha with Qatar when going in this direction and will return to that route of travel in future.,Detractor
SYD-DXB-CDG and CMN-DXB. Seating is tight particularly on the 777 compared to the A380 (don't like the 10 abreast idea). Cabin staff look good and do everything expected of them but do seem a little cold and lack warmth. Was disappointed that both DXB arrivals were at remote gates which makes the arrival experience tedious. Used the Dubai Connect hotel/transfer service from Casablanca (connecting onto Qantas at DXB) which is a godsend. Was impressed how efficiently it all worked. DXB airport is huge but works reasonably well. Enjoyed using the Business Lounge possible because of my Qantas Club membership. IFE is excellent.,Promoter
I flew from Copenhagen to Dubai in January 2014 on the brand new 777-ER. The seats were comfortable and the service was excellent. For the entertainment you didn't need to use the corded control they supplied you with a tablet to control your entertainment. If you didn't like the screen or you wanted to play games the tablet was a great option. I had some problems with the people in front of me. It was a family of 3 the child tossed crisps onto me and the parents couldn't care less. Staff said nothing to the parents.,Promoter

Flew from LAX to Dubai on 3/25/14 and back on 4/15/14. The service level was poor! The food was lousy and the bathrooms were dirty and out of stock! There were trash on the cabin floor and none of the attendants bothered to pick it up! The food trays stayed in front of passengers for at least 40 minutes before they were picked up. The internet connection was very poor and I kept being disconnected every few seconds! When passengers myself included used the button to call an attendant no one paid any attention! Mine was on for 30 minutes before an attendant turned it off while he was passing by and didn't even bother to ask me why I turned it on!,Detractor
I've flown Emirates on a regular basis for 6 or 7 years and it seems the reliability is slipping. LGW-BKK-LGW - all flights were late (up to 1.5 hours) except the DXB-LGW leg. 2.5 hour connections in DXB are now becoming very tight and stressful due to lateness of flights and the inordinate amount of bussing in DXB. Check-In (online) on all flights excellent. As for the flights themselves all very full so Emirates must be doing something right. Cabin Service in Business is OK but nothing special and in Economy is very much dependent on the crew - can be highly variable. On the plus side the in flight entertainment is good the prices are competitive and frequent fliers are frequently upgraded. The bad news is that Emirates seem to be expanding faster than DXB is so I don't see the transit experience getting any better any time soon.,Passive
EK231 April 14 2014. Overall experience: unsatisfactory rude flight attendants. My first time flying economy class with Emirates and I will never use them again. Flight attendants were rude when serving meals. My wife was asked what kind of food she would like and she said chicken.

April 6 to April 11. Flight 206 from New York and 205 from Milan Italy. I was very surprised to learn upon check in that the carry on requirements for economy consists of one bag that has to weigh no more than 7 kilos. In my entire life I have never had my carry on bag weighed so this was surprising. Many carry on bags can weigh up to 8 lbs for just the bag depending on the construction so 7 kilos is unreasonable to an extreme. Otherwise the flight was more enjoyable than most but given this unreasonable weight requirement I cannot fly Emirates again unfortunately. My carryon was weighed which put me into a position to have to decide if I should check an expensive camera and laptop and how to do that for which there really was no solution. A supervisor eventually came over took one fast look at the contents of my carry on without me saying anything and said it's fine but there was a good 10 minutes of discussing what to do before that.,Passive

Overall service: unsatisfactory. Flight 232 on 3/1/14 from Washington DC to Dubai. Plane was dirty and flight attendants were rude. These people needs to be retrain as far as providing good customer service to their passengers. Example: It took almost 2 hours to clear the trays after we ate. Upon arriving in Dubai we had to walk from one end of the concourse to the other end to catch our connecting flight from Dubai to the Philippines. Upon reaching the gate we were told we had to go back to where we came from to catch the same flight. After another hour or so of waiting we were told to go to another place to catch the plane this was when we were put in a shuttle and driven to where the plane was. Upon boarding I asked one of the flight attendants of what was going on and instead of listening she started arguing with me.

The measure of an airline is how they behave when things are not going right. My experience of this airline is that they tell lies and are a disorganized rabble. They were 2 hours late out of Sydney which they blamed on the late arrival of the plane however as the flight was leaving at 6.00 am and there is a curfew in Sydney this was not true. We were told on check in that they would make up time in the air which they did not. We were told they would make the connecting flights wait in Dubai which they did not. The ground staff at Dubai were unprepared and uninformed as to what was planned for us. I will not use this airline again.,Detractor
Flew from JFK to Dubai in March 2014 with final destination Lahore Pakistan. Liked the new A380 but economy seats are not comfortable as compared to 777. The worst part is window seats are useless because A380 double window distance is too wide to enjoy looking outside. The meal service was terrible both ways. Only 3 distinct ethnic foods in menu and usually then ran out off some of them (usually what I liked). I complained and was told that its very difficult to serve 400+ economy passengers and take care all of their food types. I was dismayed by the answer. Their 777 from Dubai to Lahore was old. I usually fly using PIA which is a direct flight from JFK to Lahore. Unless I want to see Dubai or this route is short I will never use Emirates to go to Pakistan. Don't see any major difference. PIA is not bad at all when you actually compare with Emirates.,Passive
Manchester to Perth business class. Experience from Manchester to Dubai was very disappointing. Boarding was chaotic and very disorganised the service from the young male attendants very poor.

The TV did not work a lady did move me but that was just an hour before we landed. All in all a bad experience.

Washington Dulles (IAD) direct to Dubai. I have no complaints at all for this flight. My complaint comes from my return. Was at the airport (Dubai) 3 hours early. No problem going through security. I will just skip to the problem. Poor communication. We were delayed 7 hours yes 7 hours and no one to tell us anything. We sat on the plane for 3 hours before we were told the plane was being taken out of service. Sat at the gate for another 3 hours and still no word.

We flew from Heathrow to Dubai on an Airbus 380 early in December 2013 on this trip they ran out of food choices and I was told that I could not get the chicken that I had asked for. The flight crew were harassed and totally disorganized. When we few back in March 2014 exactly the same thing happened - sorry we have run out of the choice you asked for on the menu. Also my headphones were not working after having had the light on for about two hours I eventually got up and went to the crew to ask for another one. Emirates prides itself on good service and this was not the case on the Airbus. We flew from Dubai to Johannesburg and back on a 777 and I cannot fault the service on these planes.,Passive
Flew BNE-DXR-LHR and return on A380 all legs. I had great crew on every single leg who were friendly and attended to our wants at all times. In between meal services we were constantly supplied with water/juice. All legs bar one departed on or close to time (dep LHR one hour late but arrived pretty much on time to DXB). My only complaint would be the lack of leg room in economy class and the bottom part of the seat was a bit too soft. Seat width was fine and meals were just above the average for economy class Would recommend Emirates economy for a competitive price and decent service as long as you remember if you want top shelf seats and service to fly business or first! Wifi service is non existent/very hard to connect to in DXB which isn't an emirates thing but does reflect on them as it's their home airport.,Promoter

For some reason our pre-booked seats were changed at the gate. When we boarded we complained to a member of cabin staff and they made sure we were seated in the seats we had booked on-line. I slept really well on my flights and the seat pitch was good (I am 6 ft). Will definitely fly long haul with them again.,Promoter
Flew on EK 108 from Larnaca to Dubai on their brand new 777-300er. Overall clean plane crew very attentive and appeared as soon as call buttons were pressed. Inflight entertainment worked without a glitch and the food was delicious. Keep it up Emirates!,Promoter
We travelled on the A380 from LHR to Dubai. Upon entering the plane first impressions was wonderful the inflight entertainment was great. Though that is the only good thing about this airline the cabin crew is the worst. The crew are awful they don't care about service at all we waited over 3 hours after we pressed the call button for a stewardess to come. The food is awful nothing but a horrible chicken curry on the menu on both legs of the journey. The final meal served will probably be a biscuit and a cup of tea. I had high hopes for this airline but they are really awful Dubai is a wonderful place to visit but don't fly with this airline.,Detractor
DXB-MCR. Having landed from Sydney I upgraded to Business using Skywards miles. Well worth it. Lounges at DXB are massive and though functional have lost the intimate atmosphere that once existed. Food in lounge was fairly predictable too. Flight delayed in DXB 1 hour due to passengers being off loaded but was onboard so managed to relax and watch a movie. Flight was good and service fine. Food much improved for Economy though the snacks in the lounge at rear of plane were a little stale. Chauffeur Drive from MCR worked well. Not cheap but if you have miles to spend an upgrade is well worth it.,Passive

TPE-DBX-NCL Business Class. Second time to fly business class on Emirates after many years flying mostly economy. Service was outstanding from chauffeur pick-up through check-in and most importantly onboard everything went smoothly and everyone was extremely professional and helpful. Drinks and food were plentiful and well presented and when I was unable to get one preferred meal option the cabin crew were very apologetic even expressing their apologies again as I disembarked. It was hardly their fault but I appreciated that they felt it could be important to a passenger. Seats were amazing and i recommend the mattress to add that little extra comfort throughout the flight. ICE was great but on first leg the B777 felt slightly older and the control panel less responsive than on the DBX-NCL leg. Cabin crew couldn't have been more helpful and polite. I've flown economy 15+ times with Emirates and have never had any complaints about their quality or service but it was worth paying the extra to be in business class for two long flights and be pampered. DBX business lounge in Terminal 3 is a little too basic but I won't complain about the snacks or drinks available. Logged on to complimentary wifi easily. I'm looking forward to my return trip.,Promoter
DXB-CMBEK 650 First Class Suites B777-300ER. The First Class Lounge in Terminal 3 (B Gates) was good and the menu service meals were excellent. Boarding was not well organized. Inflight service was excellent but not outstanding given that First Class was not full. Each suite is very comfortable and well laid-out though the decor is amazingly garish. No privacy when the sliding doors are open unlike some First Class suite designs of their competitors. No amenity kit as it was a four-hour night flight. Was promised socks toothpaste/brush and eye shades but never received any. Toothpaste/brush shaving cream/razor and combs were available in the well- maintained toilets for self service. Meals were very poor for First Class though well presented. I ordered the Sri Lankan meal (Chicken Koththu Roti) but it was hotter than anything I've been served in Colombo and was truly tasteless. I sent it back and ordered an omelette that was the exact opposite (too bland) and had a machine made look about it. One expects much better in First Class especially as I recall the amazingly delicious food Emirates served in First Class ten years ago on a LHR-DXB flight served from a trolley rather than on trays like now and a more recent meal in First Class served by EK last year on a CMB-DXB flight. I know everyone is looking at cost-cutting measures but this is supposedly First Class. The flight departed DXB and arrived in CMB on time. Baggage delivery in CMB was prompt and baggage transfer from BA at DXB was very well handled by EK. For a four hour flight EK Business Class which I typically use on this route seems a better value.,Passive

DUS-DXB-CGK (Dusseldorf - Jakarta) on 08/09 March and return 21 March. All flights 777 300ER. Air fares a fraction of what Lufthansa offered. Very satisfied with flights on time and service prior to take off and at the airports. Service during flight overall OK but staff could be more attentive. Seats a bit old partly broken. Met a friend in Economy and found out the main dish was exactly the same food I ordered in Business! Was not hungry when lunch was served and 2 hours later there was nothing left over except for desserts was disappointed.,Passive
EK 409 on 16 March. Left on a 3.20am flight that I would not really recommend given the time. Travelling business I at least thought the staff would promptly go around the cabin and get any services out the way ASAP. I wanted a nightcap to help me sleep and it took an amazing 1.5 hours before I got it. I have travelled Emirates before and they have been good but a little more attention to customers paying for service regardless of time would not go astray. The one saving grace was inflight entertainment.,Passive

EK002 March 16th LHR-DXB. The staff are extremely casual and non-professional. They lack the basic courtesy on how to serve premium passengers.

They didn't seem to notice at all that passengers had already boarded. Though the staff were not rude they were extremely casual in service.,Passive
SYD-BKK-DXB then to LHR. SYD-BKK leg was late by about an hour. This was EK 419 on 7/3/2014. Lay flat bed was hard and not actually lie flat. Food was less than average and certainly of a lesser quality than economy flight outbound. Wine served warm no offer of pudding or cheese after main course. Very little soft drinks offered and the cabin crew were less than helpful. BKK-DXB: Breakfast served cold asked for the Deli platter but told it was not available. Flight service mediocre - no soft drinks offered. Seat uncomfortable and not lie flat. New cabin crew no better than on SYD-BKK leg. DXB-LHR. As flight was late into DXB was held at arrival gate and then asked to run to next gate - no chance! New A380 to LHR and such a difference to the 777 on the other legs. Great service good food far better seat good food and great cabin crew. Next trip I will go back to Cathay business class which is far better even on a 777.,Detractor
Heathrow to Christchurch on a 777 but was disappointed that the seats which were classed as going flat in fact went to only approx a 30 degree angle with the feet slopping down. I didn't find out until the end of the journey that I could have asked for a mattress. This was disappointing as I have been on a 777 with another company to NZ where the seats went completely flat with feet resting on the day time footrest so there was no problem with sliding down. The configuration of seats with them was also better with individual seats so no stepping over other passengers legs. Apart from that the service was very good and as someone who needs wheelchair assistance I was treated with consideration. I also needed dietary requirements and the food was very good and well presented.,Promoter

Poor service onboard with very limited drinks offered fortunately I had bottled water with me. Boarded plane at DXB in plenty of time but departed 1 hour late informed by pilot this was because of the delay in getting peoples baggage through the airport and onto the plane as basically the airport could not cope with the amount of passengers/flights. Arrived in SGN but only one bag did the other never made the flight along with 20 other passengers bags took 2 days to get the other bag.,Detractor
EK230 2/26 SEA-DXB. EK775 3/3 DXB-DUR. EK776 3/14 DUR-DXB. EK229 3/16 DXB-SEA. First time flying Emirates. Found staff to be very attentive to our every need. On the first meal service our first choice of meal was not available they made a note and when they came back through with the second meal service they ensured that we got to tell them our choice before they went through the rest of the cabin. The seat is very comfortable considering the configuration. I would deduct a star as they really do cram the seats in by adding 2 additional seats in every town when most airlines add an inch to the seat width and have a 2x4x2 configuration Emirates elects to do 3x4x3 which feels a lot more cramped than other 777 aircraft I have been on. Food was excellent with great choices. Inflight entertainment is really the best I have experienced especially the aircraft that had the latest version of the ICE system loaded. There was no shortage of excellent entertainment to help pass the long hours on the flight.,Promoter

Seat comfort however average with rather hard seats and 3x4x3 arrangement making you feel crammed on a sold-out flight as this. I recently flew Turkish Airlines where 3x3x3 arrangements in more comfortable seats made journey more comfortable. However IFE excellent especially music selection. Flight attendant forgot to serve coffee but - as a compensation - offered mini-bottle of cognac at end of flight. All in all a very good experience.

Last October my wife and I flew from London to Hong Kong return with stop-overs in Dubai. We were in economy class on their Airbus 380 and Boeing 777s. This was a great experience in every respect. The aircraft cabins were in excellent shape comfortable seats with good leg space and the entertainment system worked flawlessly with a grand selection of films and music. Meal service was exceptionally fine. Receiving hot meals included in the air fare on economy class is a scarce treat nowadays.

Flew FRA-DXB and DXB-MAD back in February. Generally speaking all aspects of the service were more than satisfactory. From my experience at the ticket counter in FRA where the gentleman was very courteous to checking in online the DXB bag drop with no line and the generally polite service onboard I thought the staff did a very good job of creating an atmosphere of consideration for the passengers. The only thing I missed was that on the flight from FRA to DXB there simply were not enough water runs (although from DXB to MAD there were plenty). I had to ask for water and even then the cup size given to me was more appropriate for a shot of whisky than the generous glass of water I needed. Of course the ICE entertainment system was excellent as was the food service. Overall I would recommend Emirates but I would advise bringing a couple of bottles of water with you to prevent dehydration.,Passive
EK0349 8/03/2014. Colombo to Dubai. I found the service terrible. It was 2 hours into the flight before we were served anything not even a drink of water was brought. I even rang for someone to come and it was ignored. Would not use Emirates on this sector again.,Detractor

A380 from LAX-DXB-MAA. LAX to DXB was the worst. I had an infant child of 9 months old and didn't get a bassinet. Flight attendants said the baby looked too big and the bassinet wouldn't hold him.

EK 372 on 27th Feb 2014. We have flown regularly with Emirates for many years and have been very happy. The way the airline dealt with us following the alleged baggage system crash on 27th Feb was appalling. Despite the fact that aircrew know that most passengers baggage had not been loaded no information was provided during the flight or at the airport. Instead we were left forlornly waiting at the carousel. By the time people twigged what was happening the two ground staff at the information desk were besieged. They were totally unprepared and chaos ensued. Essentially people were abandoned to their own devices with no attempt to communicate or put contingency arrangements in place. This was a repeat of our experience last year which we attributed to a one off aberration. Frankly you can have all the comfort and good food you like but if your customers walk away feeling angry and frustrated you will not get repeat business. Things do go wrong occasionally and most people are pretty reasonable if they know what is happening.,Detractor
22nd Feb 2014 arrived in London Gatwick at 11am for our 1.30pm flight to Dubai to be told that the flight was delayed by 6 hours and would not take off until 7pm. Staff at Gatwick and on the flight were unable to give us any information about our connecting flights to India. Landed in Dubai at 6am on 23rd Feb and although all passengers on the flight had missed their connections there were no ground staff waiting to direct us. Asked to go to the transit desk found more than 500 people crowded into a small space with no proper queue. Only 2 Emirates staff were available. We stood for 4.5 hours with no refreshments. Communication was very poor and we had no idea how long the wait would be. At 10.30 am staff started directing passengers to different gates depending on their destination. We sat until 5.30 pm with no information as to which flight we were likely to catch. Although they handed out food vouchers at 2.30pm they ran out so not everyone got vouchers. At 5.30pm we were finally given boarding cards for the 9.45 pm connecting flight to Trivandrum. Although we waited 16 hours in the airport Emirates were unable to offer us a hotel room or even a lounge. Finally arrived at our destination at 3.45 am on 24th Feb. We appreciate that delays due to bad weather are unavoidable. However Emirates had 24 hours notice after the fog on Saturday morning and did nothing to prepare for the chaos on Sunday.

We flew from Birmingham to Cape Town business class which involved a change in Dubai. These flights were on Boeing 777ER planes. Every aspect of the flights was of the highest standards such that for the first time in years we actually looked forward to our return flights! The service was excellent with courteous friendly staff and fabulous food and wine. The seats are roomy and comfortable and we slept for 6+ hours on the Dubai-Cape Town sector - well beyond what we have done on BA and other flights. The provision of mattresses for the seats is a wonderful idea. The entertainment system is superb. In addition the chauffeur cars are a great way to being and s=end a trip.

Singapore - Nice return on a business trip with a transit in Dubai both ways. Overall the quality of the trip was good. Seats comfortable slide suite doors a bit gimmicky but definitely help with privacy / quietness for sleeping. Didn't eat on all legs but when I did the quality of the a la carte food was excellent. Drinks list wide. ICE system has great content but the tablet style controller is sometimes unresponsive. In flight wifi / mobile connectivity only available on one leg out of four which was disappointing as the one leg that had it was a night leg when I wanted to sleep! Emirates First lounge in DXB very comfortable. All flights on time. Only complaints are that the cabins seemed too warm and that Dubai airport remains a bit of a mess for transit. Might be better when all construction works complete. Price for this First trip was barely any higher than Singapore Airlines Business class to Europe so on that basis the value for money is good. This is a regular trip for me and I'd consider EK next time.,Promoter
First time to be disappointed by EK service. Arrived at the airport on time to find out that my flight to JED was delayed 7 hours not to mention check in staff didn't know why and why we had not been informed. Asked if I could leave DXB intl to go home and come back they said no since it was an estimated time and the plane might take off at any time. Stranded at DXB intl for 8 hours. Later on asked another member of ground crew about the update on my flight he was careless to even answer me properly. Onboard 2 female crew were shouting at passengers. Lack of communication from management to staff dealing with passengers is a major problem. On the return RUH-DXB flight on time A330-200 the oldest in EK fleet no entertainment only one meal option I was surprised that they are serving a full meal on this short 90 minutes flight. The most uncomfortable seat on a plane. Those aircraft's should be phased out immediately.,Detractor

Travelling back from Bangkok on 23rd Feb our flight was scheduled to land in Dubai Airport at 00.30 local time. Due to the fog from the previous day in Dubai we were told when checking in that our flight from Bangkok would be delayed 2 hours making our departure time 22.40 instead of 20.40. When we received our boarding passes they were printed with a departure time of 00.10 meaning a delay of 3.5 hours. After 4 + hours of no updated information they called us to the gates. Eventually arrive in Dubai at around 5.30 am local time 5 hours after our scheduled arrival time. After an hour or so with very little movement in queues peoples patience began to wear thin. After 3+ hours we decided to try somewhere else in the airport for answers I eventually got on a flight at 5pm that day and arrived home around 40 hours after leaving my hotel in Bangkok.

"Economy B777-300ER from Manchester to Perth via Dubai. What a pleasant surprise when boarding at Manchester. The seat pitch was far more than I expected I am 5'8"" and there was more than enough room to stretch out. Yes the seats are narrow but I personally didn't find that to be a problem. The entertainment was ICE and not wide screen which was a disappointment as there wasn't as much on offer to watch as advertised. The food was great and the crew very attentive. Upon boarding at Dubai the IFE this time was ice wide screen and what a difference - absolutely superb. There was so much to choose from! Again the seating was great and the service first class. Return leg was the same routing. Only 84 passengers from Perth to Dubai so we were All able to stretch out and have a row each to ourselves. Older entertainment system again though. Return to Manchester was packed. Even more updated entertainment which huge screens hand held touchscreen device and a brilliant selection. Tip - if you're travelling economy on this type of aircraft try and get in the first section of economy as there's less people the no one walks past and no queue for the toilet. Avoid row 21 though as that is the last row of that cabin section and you do get people waiting for the toilet there. We had row 18 and 19ABC and they were great seats. I will definitely fly Emirates again.",Promoter
EK 215 and EK 823. LAX-DXB and DXB-DMM. Pleasantly surprised was dreading this flight back because of the bad experience I had during the inbound flight. It wasn't a full flight and I had all 3 seats to myself so could lie down made the 16hours leg comfortable. Plenty of drink runs and the food was very good albeit a small quantity but it was spaced well so I wasn't hungry throughout. Attendants were attentive but some seemed disinterested and cabin service can get disorganized at times. ICE was great but did not use much and noticed its the same contents as before. Seemed like catering out of DXB was of poorer quality hence the return from LAX is better. Transit at DXB was good arrived in the evening so not a lot of people. DXB-DMM was a hit and miss food was very good or a 1 hour flight but cabin crew was very disorganized and always on a rush. Landing smooth and communication from the cockpits was ok.

EK 313 and EK 312 - 17th Feb and 22nd Feb 2014. I've done 2 flights in the last week with Emirates 1 in Business and 1 in Economy and I have to say it's been very hit and miss with the service and food served. The Economy flight DXB to Tokyo and the return was in Business. Funny thing was the Economy journey was better reasonable food and service. The seats were good for Economy class decent pitch and leg room etc. The service in Business seemed very disorganized and slow and the food was very average. The seats I found very narrow and carried the vibrations of people walking past and the person next to me moving around. We were delayed nearly 5 hours on-route because of fog in Dubai which is not the airlines fault of course but a lack of communicating left everyone wondering what was going on.

My wife and I flew EK414 etd Dubai 0150 in January 2014. This is a direct flight Dubai to Sydney on the A380. The business seats on the Emirates A380 appear roomy until you actually sit in one when you realize that the arrangement of everything around you actually quite crowds you. The extension of the food and beverage tray leaves very little room to move. The bed is actually a flat bed but the shoulder room is too squashed even for the average sized person that I am. This made it difficult to get any reasonable sleep. The hostess insisted on keeping the shutters down for the full 14 hours of the flight as we travelled from night to day and then into the night. I think that this contributed to our very first experience of jet lag and we have done quite a bit of travelling. The business class bar is wasted space.,Detractor
My wife and I flew on EK419 etd Sydney 1845 last September. The first leg on this B777 took us to Bangkok the second leg was to Dubai. Out of Sydney we tried to get some sleep and the hostess provided us with a thin mattress each for the flat but reclining bed. This initially seemed comfortable but we both awoke to find that we had slipped down the bed towards the footrest. On the second leg we dispensed with the mattress and we both had some good sleep. The reclining bed proved to be surprisingly comfortable and there is plenty of shoulder room to turn over in.,Passive
As we checked in at London Gatwick for Emirates flight EK0016 we were told the flight was delayed 1 hour advised that there were around '30 of us' so there would probably be ground staff waiting for us to escort us to the connecting gate. We asked whilst in the air if we would make the connecting flight and were told we would arrive at 1am and therefore would have plenty of time to make our way to the connecting gate. Arrived at the airport disembarked and were met by ground staff at 1.40am who advised us the connecting flight had already left. We were sat in the connecting flight area while our baggage claim tickets were taken from us advised that they needed to rebook our flights. When we were given meal vouchers at 2.20am I asked how long we would be waiting for they couldn't give a time. Told we would be on the 9.55am Qantas flight to Sydney QF002. Given a hotel voucher and advised we needed to be back 2 hours before the flight to check-in. 5 hours at the hotel did not seem worth the hassle and we asked if we could instead use the Emirates lounge told no to this request. We finally got to the hotel at 4.30am. When we finally arrived back at Dubai airport to check in to our rebooked flight we were told that as it was an almost full flight there were no seats next to each other left and that we would be sitting in separate aisles and middle seats. We did not pay extra money to be on a flight that arrived at a convenient time in Sydney only to have this ordeal happen to us and to be put on a full flight where we could not even sit next to the person we booked our flight with. Our dietary requirements were not carried over to the next flight we were not given an apology for this or an alternative solution. other airline would have provided.,Detractor
Outbound EK0062 from HAM-DXB (Aug 2nd 2013) and EK0372 from DXB-BKK (Aug 3rd 2013). Inbound EK0373 from BKK-DXB (Jan 23rd 2014) and EK0061 from DXB-HAM (Jan 24th 2014). Entertainment system is above everything else I have tried. The food and drink options are the best I have tried in Economy. They offered juice and water multiple times after food was served and if you turned on your lights the staff came right away. On my way home I had a few hours to spend in Dubai and one of the attendant took a lot of time to tell me about Dubai - what to see transportation how much money to exchange etc. Overall I more felt I was flying business than Economy.,Promoter
Flew MAN-DXB-KUL and return flew on the new A380 the first leg and was very impressed with the seating meal and drink service plane only 1/2 full. Staff very friendly and efficient. The second leg was on the 777 to Melbourne Via KL. What a horrible journey seating was very tight and plane was full to capacity. Service onboard was not good at all food was bad and the drinks service only came once. Staff seemed to be more intent on chatting in the galley than actually serving the passengers. The return was no better from DXB to MAN but plane was not even half full so this made it a bit more bearable. Why does Emirates insist on over crowding the 777. Will only fly Emirates if the journey is on the A380.,Promoter
Economy on EK405 (codeshare Qantas as QF8405) from Melbourne to Singapore on 19 Feb 2014. Emirates sent a B777-300 that was an older version without ICE digital but IMHO it is still much better than those found on Qantas A330-300s. The flight was operating below capacity hence most passengers had an entire row to themselves. Service staff ok dinner decent and entertainment options were very good. All in all a generally good flight to Singapore - nothing special but definitely not horrible. Worth flying again for the price paid.,Promoter
Flight EK 384 from Bangkok to Hong Kong on Feb 13th 2014. The flight was delayed for almost an hour. However they did arrive in Hong Kong 20 minutes late. The food and beverage was great and plentiful. The IFE good and the seat was comfortable for a short flight.,Promoter

BHX to CMB and back. The first flight to CMB was awful we had to wait 2 hours more then expected I had a baby and my son with me and they did not offer my children any meals or food for the whole flight. My son was upset because he did not receive the small backpack with colouring pencils and a colouring book (which you normally get for kids). The return flight however was pleasant we did get food this time and the crew was friendly! We paid enough money for the ticket so I hope next time will be a lot better on both flights.,Passive
Flew Manchester to Tokyo Haneda with transit in Dubai. Both planes 777. Was very happy to be upgraded from business to first between MAN and DXB. The free car service to/from airport was excellent. EK's lounge at MAN is world class - a full free buffet restaurant and excellent showers with full hotel style towel pack on request. The business lounge at DXB also very good: full free buffet restaurant service. Quite full but so many seats that there was no problem in finding somewhere comfortable to sit. MAN-DXB: service in almost empty first cabin was exceptional with stunning food and extremely comfortable private seat. DXB-HND: business seats a tad narrow but long offering a fair degree of privacy and slept well with the additional mattress provided. Food and service both extremely good. Plane was a little old and sad and would have benefited from small repairs and adjustments to fittings but everything worked and was very clean. I fly EK reasonably often but can always find new content on the excellent ICE AV system. The Emirates' Saver Business ticket represented extremely good value even without the upgrade to first several hundred pounds cheaper than European carriers with the plus of free car service included.,Promoter
Flew BKK-SYD on Feb 7th. Business class lounge closed for refurbishment. Very shocked at the low standard of the substitute Qantas lounge - extremely average. Cheap wine and almost no food. Business class cabin was full. Dinner service on overnight flight was average. No amenities kit on 9+ hour overnight flight. Surprisingly second rate IFE - no comparison with premium routes. Breakfast was continental - it consisted of fruit dry croissant and coffee. Overall this was an extremely average experience. The seats are fine so great for sleeping but the service and product beyond that are non-existent.,Detractor
DMM-DXB and DXB-LAX. DMM-LAX: flight attendants look as if they don't want to be there delayed flight due to late turn around of the plane. A general sense of being disorganized. Good: ICE system and fruit meal for an hour flight. DXB airport is too crowded just too many people. DXB-LAX: full flight with very little service throughout. Only one drinks service call light largely ignored. Food was poor and service was an eternity only one full meal. Snacks were not served. Seats are uncomfortable. Good: few FAs were attentive toilets were clean and ICE system was good. Overall: not a good flight. I'm not looking forward to my return flight.,Detractor
Flew a 777 Adelaide-Dubai-Istanbul - Reasonable service but very slow. The A380 return flight Amsterdam-Dubai - service was shocking.

Flew from Mumbai to JFK via Dubai on February 4th this year in coach/economy. The cabin crew seemed very disinterested. The seat was broken and I had to repair it myself on the Mumbai to Dubai (Flt 509) leg of the journey. The overnight portion of the trip (Dubai to JFK Flt 203) was very unpleasant principally due to the over abundance of passengers traveling with young children who screamed the entire flight. It was impossible to read or watch a movie. The flight attendants simply didn't want to be bothered.,Detractor
Travelled business class EK 379 from Phuket to Dubai and EK 025 the next day from Dubai to Glasgow on Feb 1. Phuket Airport was very busy and the business class lounge operated by a local company was awful. We were chaperoned from check in desk to this lounge bypassing the long queues which was very helpful. Overnight flight. The flat bed was not very comfortable but I saw on the next flight a mattresses being provided. These were not on offer but may have made a big difference. The limousine service at Dubai and Glasgow were excellent. The flight to Glasgow was also on time and very comfortable. The food was average and poorly presented.,Promoter

Flew WAW-DXB on old A330 aircraft. The business class seat was not fully reclining but was still very comfortable. The inflight entertainment was old and needed updating. Many channels couldn't be accessed and the ones that were had functional text (eg volume brightness) on the screen which couldn't be removed. The service and food was excellent though they did forget to serve us our cheese and biscuits. They were very apologetic about that and managed to serve it literally 15 mins before landing.,Promoter
Auckland-Melbourne-Dubai-Amsterdam. I wasn't really convinced about the quality of the airline. The good things were the in-flight entertainment and the food.

Will definitely choose Singapore Airlines or one of the other Asian carriers again next time!,Passive
Business class BKK to SYD - I felt like I was inconveniencing the flight attendant. The food was very ordinary but it was the service that was woeful. The flight attendant allocated to our seats was rude whenever we asked for anything. No comfort kit.

A380 flight from JFK - Dubai - Kuala Lumpur early in December 2013 with my wife and 3-year old son. 1st leg: JFK- Dubai-KL. On the JFK - Dubai route they flew the A380 which was nearly full. It was an 11 pm flight - the crew only began to start serving food 4-hrs after take-off! My son did not receive his complimentary inflight toy set they did give the toys out but ran out before reaching us. Always had to do a 'reminder' request for water or drinks! Dubai - KL route: they flew us in a very old A330 - flight was cramped and the seats smelt! The surface of my seat was worn out and torn. The air-conditioning and ventilation wasn't working before the flight and performed poorly in the air. Return leg (KL - Dubai): The A380 plane blacked-out when the plane was boarded and engineers had to come on board to fix the problem. During this time the plane was dark very stuffy no any offer from the crew to provide drinks. Lots of apologies from the captain though but the flight was delayed almost an hour.,Detractor
Seattle-Dubai-Sydney. Our flights from Sydney to Dubai to Seattle were mediocre. Customer Service was marginal in terms of FA attentiveness and politeness.

Emirates used to be good 2 years ago. I flew from JFK to Bangladesh through Milan then Dubai (8 hours flight each way). It was a very uncomfortable 29 hours trip because the service was very poor. Coming back was 39 hours trip. When I pressed the call button staff no one came for the entire 8 hours flight (same for Bangladesh to Dubai). I had to get up and get the water myself after 90 minutes of waiting. I paid over $2.500 USD and it was not worth the money. The seats were so close together that the passenger next to me had to place his leg on my side just to fit into his seat. The only good thing I can say about my trip was that the food and entertainment system was good.,Detractor

Food service was chaotic - I had to ask for bread wine and salad dressing was offered with dessert! The person sitting next to me almost didn't get any dinner at all because nobody took her order. No tea or coffee was offered after dinner and repeated calls to flight attendants were ignored. They didn't seem to know what they were doing and spent most of the flight hanging around in the galley area chatting. The good news? Very comfortable seats and great inflight entertainment but they didn't compensate for some of the worst service (any class any airline) I have ever experienced.

Flew LHR-DXB return in January of this year. Seat on A380 spacious and comfortable ICE system great toilets clean flights largely on time. Only problem is the dreadful cabin crew. So disorganised and slow when serving meals. Took 2 hours on the LHR-DXB flight to be offered a drink. In the end I went up to the galley area where the crew were just chatting and asked for water. Meal was served 3 hours into a 6 hour night flight so no one got any sleep. Not a single drinks run after that. Service truly appalling compared to airlines like Singapore airlines. Also no comfort kit was provided - socks toothbrush etc which I suppose is a minor thing. Return flight was better as there was one drinks run. Still not great though.

EK432 Singapore-Brisbane 25/1/2014. Having flown international business class many times on several airlines this trip can only be rated as the worst experience my wife and I have had in either economy class or business class. Staff were unhelpful and obviously unsuited to their job. From check-in to the final getting off the aircraft was one of poor service. The white wine I was served after takeoff was warm the lamb I ordered for my meal was overcooked and almost inedible the entertainment system was awkward to use and no instructions on how to use it were supplied.

29th Jan Dubai to Perth. Took an hour to check in and drop bags. Plane delayed an hour without telling passengers. Everyone was herded into a tiny departure room so we could wait in discomfort. Had booked kids meals they didn't arrive. Staff stormed off and came back with kids meals. Rest of the food was some of the worst dried out pasta scrambled eggs with the consistency of mashed potato for breakfast. Asked for another drink it never came.

I have flown with Emirates on 8 occasions (Economy) and the flight from Dubai to Gatwick on December 29th 2013 will be the last I have given the airline the benefit of doubt for too long already. Their prices are sky high and the service on board is chaotic. The staff are friendly enough but uncoordinated. The last 3 times they ran out of the meal I would have preferred. Flying out to Dubai this Christmas it was 3.5 hours into the flight before we received a meal at all and it was cold. On yet another flight they forgot to serve regular meals (those not pre-booked) to the whole block of seats from the rearward bulkhead onward. On a new A380 a couple of years ago I flew to Dubai from Heathrow with part of the ceiling flapping about above my head. On 2 occasions the ICE entertainment system was faulty.

Seats very comfortable and would definitely make for a pleasant long haul flight. IFE boasts extensive selection of movie/music/TV options. Bar lounge is a terrific space to stretch one's legs and socialise with others. Food a little basic for business class standards and some crew lacked wine knowledge but this didn't really impact too much on the overall experience. Our travel agent ordered a surprise cake for us to celebrate our impending marriage and the crew made a fuss even taking a Polaroid picture for us to commemorate the occasion - such a lovely gesture all round!

BKK-DXB Jan 2014. Bangkok Emirates lounge ancient tiny and poorly laid out. Food and beverage choice was however very good. Boarding gate minutes+ from lounge. A380 upper deck boarding via air bridge. Very friendly and welcoming crew they seem to love the A380 and explaining its features to passengers actively inviting you to come for a drink in the lounge bar. Impressive seat as anticipated comfortable and spacious with good privacy. Mini bar at seat is a nice touch but nobody wants to drink warm pepsi or fruit juice when you can get a more refreshing drink at the touch of a button or walk to the bar. Massive screen but I remain un-impressed with the range of films and TV programmes on offer. Red eye service cabin lights nice and dim throughout the flight. Full dining service offered despite the 1am departure time with a breakfast served before arrival. Skipped the meal had drinks and canapÃ©s at the bar. Nice feature of the Emirates A380 but bar seems to have little space for stock and they constantly run out of things and the poor crew are backwards and forwards from the galley constantly. Lie flat bed was extremely comfortable more so than the 777-300ER beds and combined with the seat liner and nice blankets it was brilliant. Best sleep ever on long haul. Breakfast prior to arrival was decisively average yet again tried the cold cuts and cheese as had enough of the hot offerings and the meat was off poor quality with tasteless cheese.

DXB-MAN Jan 2014. Dubai lounge again was very satisfactory stunning array of food and beverages on offer and very busy for all the early morning wave. Boarding on time and direct to aircraft from lounge via a lift. Upper deck boarding via air bridge. Crew friendly and welcoming on the whole some perhaps just business friendly. Menu for flight looks far more enticing than previous sectors. Extremely friendly and efficient steward from Dubai himself was looking after me. Very attentive throughout. Seat again is fantastic but this time a LH window seat with minibar to the window and seat more to the aisle - does not feel as private. Under window stowage is also hard to access. Variety of appetisers and sweets at the bar was great on this sector and the Manchester born girl manning the bar was chatty and genuine. Skipped breakfast and snacked at the bar on and off. Dinner service before arriving in Manchester was lovely Nice soup Beef Steak and a Cheese board to finish. Best meal in 4 flights so far and probably the nicest crew . Overall impression of Emirates after a 4 leg trip aircraft well kept A380 stands out 777-300 are getting overhauled crew attentive and professional and immaculately turned out. Food and beverages - food quite average to be honest only 1 dish got me excited. Choice of drinks good with good quality wines too.

Flew 2 way from JFK-Dubai-Manila last Nov Jan respectively. The A380 was a nice airplane with decent seats but the inflight service was underwhelming. The serving of the food was very disorganised and meal selections were always not available. The attendants were serving the coffee/tea at the same time they were serving the meal and beverage.

The ICE - entertainment system offered incredibly varied options of entertainment. My only complaint was the angled lie flat bed on the B777-300 - I have a real thing about angled lie flat bed.

EK005 7th Jan Business class with my wife and two boys aged 7 and 4. Very disappointing. The pre-ordered children's meals were not available! I was told by the FA that they had been given to other children. Why were there not sufficient meals on board? I can understand if an adult choice is not available but an airline of this supposed stature should not do this. The adult choices were spicy or containing beef which we do not eat.

Of the half dozen requests made to the in flight staff all were turned down and we're not talking about anything special. Examples such as,Detractor
HAM-DXB-HAM with B777. As always EK flight was fairly pleasant even when both flights have been packed. Entertainment system is second to none space and food better than with all European airlines. Service good both flights have been more or less in time. Check in procedure efficient. Unfortunately this time it happens to me that the stewardess spilled some coffee over my sweater. She felt very embarrassed and apologised with champagne from biz class.,Promoter
The 777 kills it. The expected A380 between Kuala Lumpur and Dubai was switched a few day ago for the Boeing 777. What a let down. Yes the A380 is great but the seating on most 777s does not provide enough space and I am a normal shape. The idea of sitting at an angle or hugging the next guy for 7 hours does not appeal to me enough to change airline which will offer me a wider seat. The 777 is a gold mine for the airline but not suited too narrow for an extra seat.,Passive
We flew Sydney - Dublin return and it was underwhelming to say the least. The service on board was very poor meals were rushed and it took over an hour and two requests to get a glass of water on more than one occasion. The cabin crew were at best not very friendly with some being extremely rude. Passengers who needed to use the washroom during the meal service were told by one crew member to wait until after the service or they would not get back to their seat.,Detractor
I flew Ho Chi Minh City transiting in Dubai to London Heathrow. I usually fly Thai because it's the fastest route by far but the recent political protests in BKK made me think it was probably unwise to transit through Bangkok at the moment. I was deeply disappointed with the seat on the HCMC to Dubai leg of the journey. I was expecting one of those not quite flat angled seat beds but it wasn't even that. The 777-200 on that route is just a reclining seat. Since the flight leaves at 00.40 in the morning I was hoping to get at least some sleep before Dubai. I fly business class to get the sleep. I might as well have flown economy. The food was very mediocre as well. However staff were very nice. The business class lounge in Dubai is excellent. I can't praise it highly enough. The food is great the showers are wonderful and the staff are friendly and helpful. The second leg of the journey was on the A380 the seat was lovely - a fully flat bed in one of those little cubicles. Unfortunately this leg of the trip was during daylight hours so everyone was being very noisy and so despite the bed I couldn't get any sleep and arrived exhausted. The food on this leg of the journey was perfectly okay. The staff were all polite but strangely distracted and not terribly co-ordinated on this leg. The wait between first course and main was about 40 minutes. Very odd. I don't know if anyone from Emirates every reads these things but if they do - could you please put earplugs in the amenity kits? All in all I'd say that although Thai planes are a little older and shabbier the cabin crew are better trained and co-ordinated the food is better the seats may not be totally lie flat but at least you get to lie down on the flights. And most importantly they always give you ear plugs.,Detractor
Bangkok to Sydney departing 10/1/14 QF 8418. Very disappointing after all the hype. Check in was a long and tedious process and between my wife and I we were a couple of kilos over the checked baggage allowance and had to argue the toss for them to allow to 2 kilos over between the two of us. Boarding at Bangkok was confusing. The inflight service was not too bad except we were served breakfast missing the promised croissants and whe we brought this to the cabin crews attention they found two cold ones for us. We had to ask three times for our Sydney arrival cards to be given to us. The entertainment system is excellent. Following our first experience with Emirates would not recommend them as a first choice airline as there are better alternatives. Emirates is either expanding too fast or resting on its laurels.,Detractor
Recently flown Emirates while on holiday with my family to Singapore and Sydney from New Zealand. I have very specific requirements when traveling due to using an electric wheelchair for mobility. Despite emailing the airline in advance with these requirements I had a distressing experience using this airline. It was awful from check-in to landing. The customer service was terrible at the check-in desk. The Emirates crew at Sydney airport were unfriendly and they were more interested in talking amongst themselves. At check-in I explained that I'd like to drive my wheelchair up to the entrance of the plane. Check-in staff made a lot of calls and eventually they assured me they were happy with my request. Having reached the gate with my family the bad service continued. The lady at the gate was surprised to see me and asked why I wasn't in a transit chair. She refused to process my boarding early. She ignored my explanation regarding my wheelchair and brought out a transit chair for me to transfer into. When I refused she made more calls and finally she allowed my family and I to continue toward the entrance of the plane. On board usually when a passenger with a disability is onboard a Cabin Service Manager (CSM) comes to say â€œhelloâ€and make sure all is OK. I was totally ignored. The food was terrible to say the least. Flight attendants did not seem interested in passengers. When we landed I had to wait for other passengers to get off first. Once the cabins were cleared I was told that a chair was on its way. 15 minutes later she showed us to a transit chair. My heart sank. I asked where my chair was and I asked that it be brought to the entrance of the plane instead. I pointed out to her that she clearly saw me board the plane with my chair and I was requesting the same procedure to happen in order for me to get off the plane. Within a few minutes my chair was brought to the plane. What could have been a very simple problem to resolve turned out to be a nightmare. I am hesitant to travel with Emirates again.,Detractor
MEL-KUL-DXB-DEL COK-DXB-KUL SIN-MEL (the latter-most operated by QF). Return ticket (AUD1250) was excellent value for money. One of the more noticeable (but unfortunate) features was the rather surly and cold service across all EK flights. Most attendants were not too friendly concentrating on mechanically serving their flights which were fully booked. However food and beverage was solid and entertainment was excellent. Some points about particular flights: The EK409 MEL-KUL-DXB flight was unusually full of large families with young children so be prepared for a screaming economy cabin if booking this flight I would hazard a guess. This is not ideal especially given that the flight leaves MEL a few hours after midnight when you'd want a sleep. EK give me an opportunity to upgrade my COK-DXB flight to business through email for AUD330 which I took up. It was an amazing experience (for someone who has never flown business before). Service (unlike the economy service) was very warm friendly without being overbearing and the food and drink was excellent and constant (I ordered extra bread and dessert brought out very willingly). One of the attendants even got out a staff camera to take a picture for me which was a nice touch to the flight as I had told them it was my first time on business class. EK346 DXB-KUL on the A380 didn't seem any different from other aircraft although the inflight wifi was a added bonus. Overall I'd recommend EK for the excellent price but don't expect tip-top Singapore Airlines-type service.,Passive
FRA-DXB / SIN-DXB / DXB-FRA. One of the most overrated airlines in my opinion. Seats and food okay but not more than average. Cabin crew far to young to provide professional service. All service rounds appeared quite disorganized and took ages. Crew friendly but more into interaction with themselves than with the passengers. ItÂ´ s a pity that QF is codesharing with this airline on the FRA-SYD route.,Detractor
Perhaps it really doesn't quite get any better than this. Traveling in Emirates suites on the 777-300ER from Bangkok to Amsterdam is pure luxury and there are less than a handful of airlines that can compete with this product. The suite is luxuriously appointed very private and the seat converts into a very plush bed. You may as well be flying in a private jet. The service is impeccable. From the champagne Arabic coffee and dates that greet you prior to take-off to the a la carte food menu that you can choose to eat at any time the service is attentive friendly but not over-bearing. Perhaps the only complaint for the 777-300ER product would be that the lavatories are a bit cramped. Given that you want to change into your pj's prior to take-off there could be a bit more space to change.,Promoter
First Leg was SYD-DXB then DXB-DUB and return was LHR-DXB then DXB-SYD. First leg was great journey considering was on the A380 so much space and room to move about the aircraft. Inflight entertainment was excellent so much on offer (all four flights) maybe too much on offer. Was hard to pick what to watch. Food was decent though I did order special meals to get served first. Second Leg was in a B777-300 this flight was jammed full! Limited seat pitch and hard to get out of the seats and crowded. Staff on this flight very slow and a smile seemed to difficult. LHR-DXB was excellent although the purser seemed a bit childish! Flight wasn't full but still busy. Now the DXB-SYD this were the troubles begin! Check in agent in LHR doesn't check all the way through to the final stop. Got to the gate in DXB wasn't checked in came as a shock so spent 13 hours in Dubai which thanks to Qantas was made easy not Emirates. DXB-SYD night flight with night arrival. Flight was full but once again on an A380 so made that journey a little easier. Overall a good journey with Emirates!,Passive
Business class Dubai to Los Angeles - 16 hour flight regular fare and the entertainment system did not work on my seat kept resetting itself. Cabin attendant friendly but apart from resetting (which he did about 5-6 times) he didn't offer any other options. After nearly 3 hours I asked for the purser who re-set yet again twice and finally offered a change of seat. The selection of the entertainment wasn't great. Food average. I took another trip in December to Europe again due to the direct connection but again very poor selection on entertainment and food was not good at all. I would book Emirates again or recommend to family/friends but only if the price is much lower than other options.,Passive
"Flew from HK to Lyon via Dubai for Xmas holiday. I usually fly with Cathay but this trip with Emirates was much cheaper this time and since I had never tried Emirates before I gave it a try. Overall it was good but I think it depends on the aircraft you are in. For HK to Dubai was in a Boeing 777 seems a brand new one inflight entertainment was excellent! For Dubai to Lyon was in a A340-500 not bad either but the inflight entertainment was not as great as the on the Boeing. For the return trip was in a A330 inflight entertainment was really disappointing. Food was ok as well as staff. Compared to Cathay I would say that Emirates' crew is not as friendly as Cathay's (less smile seem to be quite ""cold"" sometimes). Nevertheless for the value for money I think I will fly again with them.",Promoter
In December I flew Emirates on 4 different occasions from Copenhagen to Dubai/Bangkok and I'm sorry to say that I was disappointed. The most annoying was the slow and confusing service of the cabin crew it took more than 2 hours for them to serve anything on each of the flights and it seemed like they were all trainees. On the first flight we had great large new screens for the inflight entertainment system but on the other flights the planes were equipped with an earlier version which was not at all as good. The check in and boarding procedures worked fine although there are always a lot of people who don't understand the boarding priorities. The food and beverage were of average quality and you more or less had to go and ask for the drinks by yourself. I will travel with Emirates again if I will get a good price but not for the comfort and service level.,Passive
Kuala Lumpur to London Heathrow on 5th January 2014. The prices are reasonable and the service is quite good. 2 years ago I felt the attitude of the cabin crew was poor so I avoided the airline after that. The staff were not responding to calls and was even rude to passengers. This year I thought I'd use Emirates again. I rang my call button twice and both times it took them more than half an hour to respond. They just didn't seemed bothered about serving. The food was served very late. In summary Emirates is a good airline but they just need to buck up with the cabin crew service.,Passive
DXB-DUB - Business class out and Y class back. Gold Member. The experience is a mixed bag outward in Biz pick up on time. Flight on time lounge is to me nothing but an upgrade from the main terminal with free food and drink. Staff all look over stretched and it is not in comparison to other leading airlines where you can have a quiet zone to work. Its over crowded busy and too open meaning that all sounds travel. Flight fine very full. Staff did their job but lacked any interaction skills. Return in Y again flight over booked their policy of 3x4x3 seating on the 777 is just too tight. ICE as ever was good and staff were not attentive pressed the call button numerous time they walked past me. Vanished for over 2-3 hours mid flight. Food on both legs was terrible had ordered a low cholesterol meal with low fat. Both times a salad with lettuce and tomato no dressing and fish in biz class was actually burnt so bad to was like plastic. I asked for an alternative and they had Biriyani. You get better in Y class on Saudia for a 1.5 hour flight. In Y class on return chicken breast that you could put through a window and white rice inedible. Its a pity Qatar don't start entering this route as I would gladly fly them in future. Emirates are expanding at a fast track rate but seem to be loosing the edge when maintaining standards.,Detractor
MEL-AKL-MEL A380. Check in was easy and pleasant staff onboard were professional and helpful. Emirates are fantastic when travelling with children.

GLA-DXB-BKK-DXB-GLA. I flew from Glasgow on the evening flight to Dubai on EK 026 on 10 Dec and have to say the service from the cabin crew was outstanding and very friendly. Meals and drinks were given in good quantities and the service was fantastic for a night flight. Well done However next flight on EK 372 to Bangkok on the A380 was appalling and inappropriate for the standard of Emirates. No bar service bad food and poor cabin crew. I feel bad in saying this. Return flight was on 07 Jan on EK 371 evening flight to Dubai service was again outstanding friendly cabin crew poor food as only breakfast but it was a late night flight. Good full bar service and outstanding cabin crew which did an excellent job. Last flight was on EK027 and the cabin crew were excellent food was very good and a good bar service which was up to Emirates high standards. I have been flying with Emirates for over 10 years and reached Gold status but now have Blue status. I feel that overall Emirates is excellent good value for money have excellent cabin crew which fly on modern aircraft with a good safety record. The downside is the A380 flights are a hit and miss and overrated. Also I feel Emirates has expanded too quickly to take on other middle east airlines and that the Emirates high standards are falling.,Promoter
Flew from Melbourne to Singapore on First with my wife. Two cars came to pick us up from the hotel and after insisting that one is enough for both of us and our baggage I sent of the other car. Check-in was pretty quick and the staff at the counter noticed that it was my wife's birthday so he chatted with us while processing our baggage. Immigration clearance was done swiftly with the fast track card. Spent an hour at the lounge before making our way to the boarding gate. FAs welcomed us warmly and ushered us to our suites. I have planned to surprise my wife with a cake so I arranged for it over the phone with Emirates contact centre way before my travel date. The suite was big as A380's (We flew on a B777-300ER) and the crew were excellent. Pre-take off drink with nuts Arabic coffee with dates cold towels Bvlgari amenity kits Pyjamas and Menu card were distributed while taxing for take-off. They offered an a la carte dinning with wide variety of selections. The food was fantastic. Especially the Arabic mezze (a must try). Restaurant quality food and the service were efficient. Plates were cleared promptly and the next course was served on time. The chief FA came by my seat and requested to meet him at the business class galley so that we plan for the surprise without attracting too much attention from my wife. He showed me the cake and I bought a gift from the on-board DFS. They brought the cake with tiny lights around it and greeted her. They took plenty of Polaroid photos of us. It was a very memorable flight for both of us.,Promoter
I flew with my husband on our first Emirates flight on EK434 and EK435 Business Class to Brisbane in November we usually fly BA or Singapore Airlines. I have a few comments to make on the trip first of all the food and drink service was appalling. We had to wait for service were omitted on several occasions and by the time the drink came around the meal was finished. I asked for drinks on a number of occasions and didn't get it even using 2 different male/female cabin crew. I had to get up myself and go to the bar for water on several occasions to find the staff chatting quite happily in the rear oblivious to the alert light I had pressed for assistance . But the most disappointing part of the trip was on the short stopover in Dubai business Lounge on the return flight we expected to have a shower and change. The facilities in Dubai were pathetic there were queues and the turnover in cleaning the shower cubicles was painfully slow. We gave up and continued on our journey without refreshing the Business lounge in Dubai leaves much to be desired it is difficult to find food and the way it is designed could definitely be improved. After British Airways and Singapore Airlines and Qantas we would put it bottom of the list.,Detractor

SYD-AKL-MEL A380. Very disappointing I have flown Emirates about 10 times and it is consistently deteriorating now to the point where it is not worth bothering with. The previously generous and hi-spec economy meals have been replaced with a smaller tray with much lower quality food. The crew on both flights were unprofessional to the point of it being quite sad on the first flight the service was a shambolic mess and on the second they were far more concerned with flirting with each other and chatting rather than serving passengers. Call bells were never answered meal service took far too long on both flights and the toilets were utterly revolting despite the newish aircraft. Only good part is the IFE. Sorry to say I won't fly Emirates ever again.,Detractor
DXB-FCO-DXB with A380-800. Wonderful experience starts at the A380 dedicated hub a modern brand new mall with excellent food and shopping offering. Boarding despite the aircraft size and the number of fellow passengers is fairly fast. Seating is spacious and the seat when laid back moves both the back and the seat giving the feeling of having double the inclination and increasing the comfort. Food was served and it was very tasty probably one my best experience in economy class. The entertainment screen was outstanding endless channels games and not to mention the WIFI available onboard and the fact that mobile was working perfectly while cruising at 39000 feet. Amazing experience for an economy class flight both outbound and inbound.,Promoter
MAD-DXB-NRT-DXB-MAD. All flights served with 777-200LR and 777-300ER. All flights left on time and arrived on time or early. Seats were comfortable enough as to manage some hours sleep and seat pitch adequate it didn't feel that cramped as stated in previous reviews but I guess because I picked the two seat row at the very end of the cabin. All seats I preselected were honoured which was nice. Outbound I did online check-in which worked fine and used the dedicated online check-in counter at Madrid which permitted me to skip the long queues for economy check-in. On board cabin crew were polite and hard working specially on the NRT-DXB leg. All requests were promptly met and you could ask for any kind of drinks and snacks between meals. Food was nice and tasty and portions adequate with several options to choose from I missed breakfast service on MAD-DXB leg though. IFE is the highlighted point of Emirates selection of movies is huge in so many different languages Big high resolution screens and an easy to navigate system. A great experience overall and looking forward to fly with them again.,Promoter

The chauffeur arrived at the hotel on time and helped us to load the luggage and drove us to the airport on a Holden Statesman car. The Emirates Check-in counter is the first counter in the row which is quite convenient. Check-in was swift and we were handed a pre-clearance form along with our boarding passes. We cleared past the baggage screening and emigration in a jiffy. We made our way to the Emirates lounge located right above the departure hall. At the boarding gate they have a separate pathway for First and business class passengers. The FAs welcomed us and guided us to our suites. We were given a pre-take off drink cold towel and Arabic coffee while we waited for rest of the flight to be filled up. A FA came to my suite and introduced himself and gave me a Leather bind menu card and told me that it's not an a la carte dining that night as it was just a four hour flight. Right after the take-off the FA came to take the dinner order. I ordered a Mocktail while waiting for my dinner to be served and it was served promptly with warm nuts. Dinner menu and the choices were pleasing and the food was great. We decided to shower the shower attendant notified us once the shower was ready. The shower was huge and had two types of timeless spa products. A series of shower gel shampoo and moisturiser for relaxation and another series of products to feel refreshed. Other amenities such as razors shaving cream moisturiser cologne and hairdryer were available too. When I returned to my seat the FA came with a detox drink and asked if I wanted the bed to be made. I relaxed at the bar's lounge seats while waiting for bed to be made. When I returned the seat was made flat and all set comfy with mattress duvet and a Godiva chocolate placed on my desk.

Flew from Brisbane to Auckland in business class on an A380. The business class is located on the top deck of the flight. Two sections with 1-2-1 configuration which enables aisle access for all passengers. The single seats on both sides are not aligned with the center seats thus giving you some privacy. The crew warmly greeted and guided us to our seats as we entered the flight. The stewardess introduced herself and told me that she has been assigned to look after for the day's flight and offered the breakfast menu and a pre-take off drink. Each seat had its own selection of drinks that includes a fruit juice two fizzy drink cans still and sparkling water. My wife decided to sleep through the breakfast service but the attendant was concerned and asked if she is feeling ok. The breakfast included fresh fruits freshly squeezed juices toasted muesli and yoghurt. The hot selection served omelettes and sausages or classic French toasts. I went for French toasts with maple syrup and berries. Food was warm and tasty. I ended of my meal with a cappuccino which had Emirates logo dusted on the foam. Nice touch The in-flight entertainment was great with wide variety of movies and dramas. The noise cancelling headphones were good too. The only downside of the center business class seats are leg space. It feels cramped with the leg room extending below the seat in front you.,Promoter
CMB-SIN in late December. Flight boarded late although had arrived on time from DXB with no explanation and a call 40 mins before anything happened. Relatively comfortable seating on a 777 - the two of us had one of the only rows with only two seats at the very back. Great inflight entertainment but let down by lousy service.

"EK 201 on 26 November. Return on 24 December. A380 JFK-DXB. Staff were unprofessional. Spent a lot of time chatting in the galley while setting up and serving meals took a long time. In between meals a fasten seat belt sign was on for long spells with no apparent turbulent weather and no one allowed to leave seats even to head to a toilet! No drinks were offered so people had to make their way to the galley. Once a meal is served it takes hours for the trays to be cleared. Passengers walked the trays to the galley themselves! Although the menus are handed out at the start (on one leg it was the wrong one) most often in economy the choices had completely run out and the only comment from the staff was ""we have bad news"". The A380 is too big too crowded too noisy too uncomfortable too irritating and no way to travel on a long haul.",Detractor
LHR-HKG via DXB. The seat pitch was surprisingly generous aboard the A380 EK006 from Heathrow to Dubai. The ICE entertainment was superb the staff were friendly and the catering was above average. What I disliked the most was the boarding 'process' they had to make it sound 'so grand'. I sat at the front and by the time I boarded and requested for eyeshades they were gone already. Also it is very hard to hear what the guy was saying as there were a battle of voices between our flight and the Qantas flight at the next gate. The queues for transfer were very long in Dubai but it was pretty inefficient. However it takes 40 minutes to get from the first gate to the second although at a leisurely pace. The second flight from DXB-HKG was far more horrible. We had to endure the horrendous 3-4-3 configuration. The ICE entertainment on the 777-300 was not as modern as the A380 thus the person behind me had to press the screen with tremendous force every time to get his TV working. The screens were also far smaller and much harder to operate. But in terms of service it was really average. In conclusion the first flight was close to being perfect and the second flight slightly disappointing.,Passive

I flew from Dubai to Perth (return) in Dec 2013. I am very impressed with their quality of customer service and hospitality. This 11 hour flight felt much shorter as I was very comfortable relaxed and entertained by the ICE system. It was also very comfortable to sleep in the very wide seats. USB and mains power supply is provided for charging devices. The highlights of these flights were certainly the crew and the catering which was of a very high quality served to you with steel cutlery. Even economy passengers receive luxuries normally expected for business and first passengers. The crew spoke very many languages and were very approachable. Emirates certainly deserve number 1 airline for the years to come and I wish to fly with them to Australia again.,Promoter

The first leg of the flight was awful - seat backrest was broken staff could not fix it so they moved us to two different seats which were even worse with a solid lump at the base of the backrests that made it impossible to get comfortable in any position on this long flight.

I wanted another drink and buzzed for assistance but nobody came. The inflight entertainment was excellent though but all in all a bad flight - Perth to Dubai. Dubai airport - the Emirates lounge was the best I have ever been in and enjoyed the 4 hour lay over. Dubai to Gatwick - slightly better as the staff were a little more customer focused.

Food great as was wine and in every detail Emirates are way beyond the competition. Have read some other reviews which are rather negative. Since we flew so many times I fail to understand the problem. Compared to recent BA experience to New York Emirates are on another level.,Promoter
The fleets are new comfy. Flew Narita-Dubai-Munich and Rome-Narita. Always wanted to try A380. The FA's were awful. On one flight the table was dirty. I took 4 flights in total and every time I experienced something horrible. Firstly they didn't give me the bread and I had to ask 2 times for it next I had to wait over 15 mins to receive my main dish. I asked for water that I didn't receive. This is the worst airline service I have experienced so far.,Detractor
NBO-SIN-NBO. First leg was alright but nothing great. Food service was slow and FA didn't clear trays for ages. Second leg to Singapore on A380 was much anticipated but disappointing seat configuration thus narrow seats thus alot of discomfort. SIN-DXB was much better but had to keep asking for water/drinks. Don't know why they just don't offer bottles of water like in business class. Flying from Singapore to Perth on Qantas we were given bottles of water to rehydrate - great for a 5 hours flight and essential for a 10+ hour flight which Emirates should consider. Last flight was the worst - lots of turbulence so we didn't get any meals. Not Emirates fault but the crew were very unprofessional. Very thirsty flight again as not enough water/drinks provided. Granted we had to remain seated during the turbulence but one cup of water and 1 juice is not enough for a 5 hour flight. Cabin crew on all sectors were not very helpful and not very friendly. Same could be said of counter staff at the business class lounge. We've been flying Emirates for 10 years and except for the last couple of years due to a change in our country of abode and travel patterns have had to use other airlines so have slipped down to Skywards silver status. We were planning to use Emirates more for our 2014 flights but will now consider other airlines. The only saving grace is the ICE entertainment system which helps you forget the lack of water/drinks the bland food and that tray in front of you.,Detractor
"Bangkok to Sydney. Have previously flown this leg 6 times with a well-known Thai based airline. As per our Sydney to Bangkok flight with Emirates the boarding was delayed. At least this time there were announcements from the boarding gate to explain what was happening. The dinner was a decent size but bland and tasteless. The menu only offers 1 dish to choose from. Then the so-called ""breakfast"" was just a tiny fruit salad with a bread roll. On the other airline I alluded to above the menu has 2 dishes to choose from (for both dinner & breakfast). The breakfast is also a full meal in itself. The cabin crew seemed a little more polite than on the Sydney to Bangkok leg although I still would not describe them as friendly or welcoming. They were a little slow to bring meals and water/tea/drinks etc. I thought the Inflight Entertainment was quite good with a wide selection of programs. I'd say both airlines are equal in that regard. They did hand out a little toiletries pack which is very handy and something the other airline doesn't do. They also gave our child a small pack with some items to keep him occupied. That was a nice touch and again something the other airline does not do. In summary I found Emirates to be overrated. The tickets were cheaper than the other airline by quite a few hundred dollars and did have a couple of little nice hand-outs the other airline does not. However I think that does not make up for the uncomfortable seating and unfriendly service.",Passive
" Punctual as ever. Aircraft is an aged Airbus A340-300. The interior unfortunately is showing its age. Seats are frayed and some are separating at the seams. Interior however was very clean and orderly. Service was grudgingly pleasant. There were however several flight attendants who were extremely upbeat, welcoming, and warm. IFE is excellent. Food is very good for economy class. The main gripe is the comfort of these very worn seats. It appears the cushions were in need of replacing several years ago. . It makes a long haul flight very long and rather uncomfortable. All in all Lufthansa does a good job but I do not believe it deserves a five star ranking.",Passive
" Landvetter to Milan via Frankfurt. Lufthansa is always the company I prefer to fly with. Today I arrived to Milano and flew with Lufthansa. I mentioned to the Flight crew that I hade a fear of flying and that I wished to sit beside my boyfriend since I got a new seat number just before we boarded the aircraft. The flights attendants said directly that it was no problem for us to change the seats. But it was not just that, also they started to talk in a super kind way that I should not be afraid to fly, and they took me to the cockpit where the kindest pilots were. We had a really god chat and I got the chance to see how everything looks in the cockpit. During the 2 flights which was with the same flight crew and aircraft we got an amazing service and I did enjoy the flight without any fear.",Promoter
" Bangkok to Luxembourg via Munich. We booked a flight directly with Lufthansa on January 1st 2019. As this is a long flight we choose the airplane (wanted newer aircraft for more comfort) and to pay for a premium economy seat to have extra leg room and to be able to choose a window and isle seat so as to have no one next to each other. At the time the reservation and seat bookings were confirmed. 4 months later we noticed on the Lufthansa app that the following changes were made to our reservation without any notification - Our seats had been changed between Bangkok and Munich. (different seats allocated than booked).Our flight time has been bought forward almost 1 hour, aircraft type has been changed (New A350 to old A340 200). The aircraft operator has been changed (from Lufthansa to Sun Express) We then called Lufthansa to ask what and below is the response. First call we are told the flight had been moved to a different airline and we should contact them directly (Sun Express) and that Lufthansa cannot help us any further despite us booking directly with Lufthansa. 2nd call were told that this is a Lufthansa flight but this plane is not listed on there website as an aircraft used. The operator then said it was a different operator and I asked if there are any alternatives. The operator booked us on a later flight same day this time with Lufthansa. However despite asking if we can have similar seats and being told they are available (we were told we could book these afterwards on line) we then see a window and isle seat are not available. 3rd call we are told a window and isle seat is not available and to write a written complaint. At this point we are told this has been caused by a maintenance issue with the original aircraft and other people have also been affected. 4th call (as we still do not have the confirmed booking we paid for) we called again and we are told we can have a window seat but when looking at our confirmation we get allocated 14D and 14E but on the seat map this is a isle and middle seat, not a window seat. 5th call we are once again told our seats can be moved to a window and isle seat and have now been allocated 14A and 14C however when looking at the details on line we understand this may not be a window. Based on our experience this falls way below the level of customer service we expected and paid for when booking with Lufthansa.",Detractor
" Vilnius to Singapore via Frankfurt. Flight crew are very professional. I really got all their attention and help. One of the best experiences so far. Touch screen TVs are very old. It was extremely annoying to use them. Moreover, it may bother the person sitting in front of you (or you may be the one who is bothered). I was sitting near to this woman who was playing Solitare on her screen and the man in front of her could not just relax watching the movie because of the constant poking to his seat. It even led to some tiny conflict in the end. People who like to enjoy alcohol during their flight, should definitely consider these airlines over the other ones, since they are serving alcohol drinks like beer, wine, cocktails on international flights for free. However, I found it the only difference in comparison to slightly cheaper airlines in regards to what you get on board for the price paid.",Passive
" I was flying from Canada to Ukraine and my last transfer destination was at Frankfurt. At Lufthansa the customer service is very poor. First of all, I was very disappointed because when I got to my seat I couldn't find any space where I could put my carry on luggage, all space was full with luggage of people that were sitting next to me. Second of all, one of the stewardesses told me halfway to my seat that there was no space for my luggage. She didn't offer her help to help me find space at the front, it was very rude because it's part of her job. She was just watching me running around trying to find space. I am very upset about the customer service that I received and I will never fly with Lufthansa again because of my experience!",Detractor
" MUC-MAD return. Excellent value for special business class fare: Fast check-in (without any queue) at MUC as well in Madrid. Excellent male pursers in business section on both sectors. Menu card provided and selection of 2 warm meals on each way! Food really tasty and plenty! Fast luggage delivery especially in Madrid! Sure you have no entertainment on LH European flights, but for 2 hours flight time nothing to complain about For European flights Lufthansa is still my first choice as you can see and feel the professionalism of the crews!",Promoter

" Frankfurt to Valencia. I have been flying with Lufthansa for the past 10 years regularly (at least 3 times a year) and always very satisfied with their service, so even though Lufthansa is more expensive than low cost companies, I pay the extra money. But last time it was quite different. Lufthansa direct flights from Frankfurt to Valencia are now operated by Sunexpress. The plane was very old, the seats worn out, the net to hold the magazines was ripped and the plane was really loud. So for the usual Lufthansa fee, we got an old airplane from a low cost airline. It is a pity to see how they cut costs at the client's expense.",Detractor
"  London to Vienna via Frankfurt. This review is for Mrs Darr from Lufthansa Customer Service in Frankfurt, a great person who did everything that was in her powers to help one of my friends change his flight only because the police in Frankfurt don't really know the law and didn't want to let 3 people go through passport control even though they are family. Everything ended well in the end but this lady went back and forward to help us with alternative routes so we can reach all of us the same destination. She was extremely patient and calm even when we were going absolutely crazy, because we were scared. Thank you again and you are going to be part of our memories as the lady who helped a lot! Hope you are going to read this! We really appreciate your efforts and your time!",Promoter
" Munich to San Francisco flight was delayed by almost 3 hours due to technical issues. Information was anything, but forthcoming. The replacement aircraft had issues with the entertainment system and power-outlets at the seat. Several restarts of the systems were executed but to no avail. The inflight crew tried to cope with the defunct hardware",Detractor
" I flew on an A380-800 from San Francisco to Frankfurt in the upper deck rear economy class compartment (rows 95-99) During boarding and the meal services one single flight attendant works these 5 rows by herself. In between services she has other duties on the lower deck and this section goes unattended for. Even when I rang the call button repeatedly, nobody answered, since the call goes to the unmanned rear galley. The adjacent business class cabin is sealed with a curtain. If any medical emergency or a safety related incident occurred in this compartment, no flight attendant might be available.",Detractor
" Rome to Mumbai via Frankfurt. The flight from Rome to Frankfurt was late by 20-25 mins. The ground staff did not ensure that the passengers having connecting flight with very little transfer time left reached on time and could skip the line. There was a long queue at immigration. The ground staff didn't help the passengers to move ahead in line. At least 50-60 passengers were running from terminal A at Frankfurt to terminal C to catch the connecting flight. The staff at security would also not ensure that the passengers with flight could move ahead in line. There was a lot of chaos and people who could run were running, but people with disabilities or problems had to go through a lot of stress to reach to the aircraft. Lufthansa needs to work on this where the problem is at their end because their connecting flight was late. The only good thing that happened was that they delayed the takeoff of the connecting flight. But all the passengers had to go through a lot of mental and physical stress because of this mis management",Passive
" Copenhagen to Washington via Frankfurt. Flew the same route in Nov 18, and was pretty impressed. However, today's performance was far from stellar. First of all the LH website is probably from the 1980's, because it sure feels that way when using it. The long-haul flight was very average, to be generous. IFE did not work. The PA system worked in business class only. I had ordered an upgraded dining experience, and if I had been served what I had ordered, I would have been much happier. WiFi did not work onboard this time. What really made the whole thing bad is that everybody was confined to their seats for the last 2.5 hours of the flight due to very strong turbulence. I like Lufthansa, but if this is what they can offer, there are much better options.",Detractor
" I did a return flight from Dublin to Cape Town via Frankfurt. On both outward and return all flights were excellent. I flew Economy on all 4 flights. I booked and paid extra for my seat which was 16k on the outward journey from Frankfurt to Capetown and 16A on the return to Frankfurt. This row was directly behind Premium Economy. From what I could see it is better to spend the money on the seat rather than PE. I had more legroom than those in PE. The food wasn't great but airline food is always hit and miss. The service from the flight attendants was superb. Nothing was too much trouble. The flight itself was very smooth and at one stage the pilot told us to fasten seatbelts as there was a lot of turbulence but it was nothing to worry about. The connection in Frankfurt was very smooth. I would definitely use Lufthansa again,",Promoter
 Prague to Frankfurt. In Frankfurt I was chosen for a special security check without saying why. Then staff at the gate took my carry on luggage saying I'm not allowed to have it. On the airplane we had no option of more than one food.,Detractor
" Jeddah to Frankfurt. Got a seat in the very last row on this night flight. When the lights went off after we departed, I realized that the LH logo just behind my seat is illuminated by 4 extremely bright lights. No way to be able to sleep under these lights. I asked an attendant to switch off the lights. Waited for approx 5 mins, nothing happened, made another call, this time another attendant came. Asked again to switch off the lights, waited 5 mins, no result. I called the third time, then the former attendant appeared and told me that they cannot do anything about it. I asked for another seat, no seats available. Sort of apology, got a sleeping mask. For final approach and landing stage, the lights were switched off which made me feel like a complete idiot.",Detractor
 Had a return flight Frankfurt to Bangkok with Lufthansa and both times it wasn't on time. It took about 1 hour to deliver my luggage in Frankfurt. Considering the flight delay I missed my train. Entertainment on board was only low rated movies and series and not many.

" Seoul to Manchester via Frankfurt. As usual with Lufthansa the flight was pretty much full. Seoul to Frankfurt was ok, but the boarding gate was miles away from the check-in desk. The inflight vegetarian meals are rubbish. Pre-ordered, so they knew they were required. Ovo-lacto means any egg or dairy ingredients are fine, but to cut corners they seem to just serve everyone a bland vegan meal. Spaghetti with a tasteless red sauce. Spaghetti with an airline fork? Penne or fusilli maybe, but not spaghetti! Lufthansa obviously just don't care about vegetarian customers.",Passive
" Rio de Janeiro to Frankfurt. Definitely below expectations. I had a seat on the upper deck. No single seats, the seats were too narrow to sleep with comfort. The light was not adjusted, no dividers for privacy. The cabin was hot and filled with the toilet smell. Flight attendants were nice but too formal and hardly available during the flight. On the good side, the movie selection and noise cancelling headphones were quite ok. The lounge in Rio is fantastic.",Detractor
" Frankfurt to Valencia. Flying Lufthansa - A good airline. Using anything Digital the worst experience among all airlines. Lufthansa (And Frankfurt airport) in general is a great airline to fly, with good planes, well maintained, great staff, clean, courteous, and efficient operations. The challenge is their digital experience. For an airline this large, I am shocked at how bad their web sites and APPS are. The speed is so slow that I feel I am back in the days of dial-up service. They seem to have layered so many pages on top of one another, that when you click on a button, you wait 10 to 15 seconds for the next page to load. Then, when you think you have it loaded, some other layer loads on top, and moves the screen so you have to search for what you were just doing. I recently booked a simple flight from Frankfurt to Valencia, and it took me over 30 minutes to book online. I then tried the APP - couldn't eventually book it in the APP because I kept getting kicked out. I don't know if this is because of internet security requirements, or whether it is because the people that designed the Lufthansa internet and APPS are incompetent. It makes me want to fly other airlines. KLM's web experience is quick and easy.",Passive
" Bangkok to Frankfurt. Premium Economy is almost twice as expensive as regular economy, but the advantages (real and perceived) are not in proportion to the price difference. Yes, we have slightly more leg space, the pitch is marginally larger than in economy, the screen is somewhat larger and we receive a small (but nice) amenity kit. Food is supposed to be served in china dishes, but the all tray was just put on a plate, instead of being deposited on the tray, I did not notice a difference in the quality of food. All in all, a terrible waste of money.",Passive
" Milan to Denver via Munich/Frankfurt. While the onboard service was slightly above average, I had a horrible customer experience at Munich airport. Inattentive service by careless gate staff about my checked bag in transit between a delayed LH flight from the US and an LH onward flight bound to Italy. To top it all up, staff gave me directions that proved inaccurate as for lost and found procedures at the arrival airport. I failed a complaint on the LH website which they escalated to the station manager in Munich.",Passive

On Lufthansa, they were rude and unkind and so I am dissatisfied with their service. Anyhow, the meals were decent as usual but Lufthansa really needs to train their cabin crew. I am hoping my mext journey would bring up this rating. Ground Service also was lacking information. Overall, quite disappointed at the staff.",Passive
" Flying Lufthansa from Munich to Delhi. I should have flown KLM instead but due to bad weather conditions the check-in staff rebooked me to othe flight with Lufthansa. Therefore I got one of the very last seats - middle row - aisle seat, so literally every passenger going to toilet was going around me or crew when serving food. I cannot blame Lufthansa for that. The seat comfort was decent, the aircraft looked new and in a very good shape. Since I flew to India we got an Indian cuisine catering, which was fine as well. Overall the flight was fine, even though we experienced a delay due to Afghan air scape closure but again I cant blame Lufthansa for that. Boarding was chaotic since one had to wait in one line to get stamp at visa and then wait for a real boarding process.",Passive

"  Bangalore to Keflavik via Frankfurt. The upgrade from economy to premium economy is misleading. When looking at how to upgrade, no mention is made that upgrade only includes the seat and not additional baggage. I have never seen this on another airline. It is listed in fine print in one of the subsections. We read the instructions on how to upgrade many times and we never saw this. It took 5 Lufthansa staff 20 minutes to find it - yet we were supposed to have seen it? When asked if we could then just go back to economy class, they could not refund our money. Great way for Lufthansa to make short term money and lose long term customers. We ended up having to pay $473 dollars in luggage. You lost us.",Detractor
 Venice to Dusseldorf via Frankfurt. Ended up on Lufthansa after a cancelled Eurowings flight and it's easy to spot the difference: better legroom and a complimentary drink and snack. Very good info from the cockpit and whisked over the Alps in little over an hour. Changing in Frankfurt is a nuisance since LH uses A and B terminal which are a long walk apart. Short hop to Dusseldorf. No drinks but with 25 mins this flight is just too short. Still my favourite airline.,Promoter
" Amman to Frankfurt. The plane was filthy, the seats barely fit a teenager, and the treatment by staff is like cattle. Business class is is basically economy with an empty seat in the middle.

" I would consider myself a budget traveler and I usually fly with cheaper airlines. This time I spent a little more money for an economy ticket on Lufthansa but I was disappointed. I was flying on a rather new Airplane (B747-8) but Lufthansa seems to be using old seats in this plane. The Infotainment system has tiny screens and is super unresponsive. The touchscreen often registers your tap in a different location. Food: The food quality is ok but below the standard of other airlines. It is obvious that Lufthansa is trying to cut some costs. For example my meal included a salad that only had the leaf in it, no tomato or other vegetables that usually belong in a salad. For my chicken I thought they served me tofu because it was just some white cubes of something dumped into some sauce without even bothering to mix them together. Lastly for breakfast I was served the main dish, a yogurt an a roll. That is alright but I would have wished for some fruit to be served along with it like other airlines do. The service is good but when the staff accidentally bumps into you or spills something they just pretend like nothing happened. I feel that Lufthansa's Economy Class product is overpriced an can not keep up with Asian non premium airlines. The food, cabin and service is not up to standard.",Detractor
 We flew from Frankfurt to Istanbul with Lufthansa. We wanted to find out how Europe's best airline is. Actually we awaited great services etc. But this was my last flight with Lufthansa. While we were waiting at the gate two policeman came and all the passengers had to go through this second security check to board the plane. Then the cabin crew was awful. After the boarding one of the flight attendants shouted at me because I was taking pictures of the planes outside. They had no motivation and were very chaotic. Additionally we had a 2h delay. It was a hot summer day and they wouldn't give us some water.,Detractor
" Birmingham to Bangkok via Frankfurt. Contract lounge that Lufthansa uses is the worst at Birmingham by a mile. It was too full when we visited with few spare seats and all the hot food options had run out. Flight to Frankfurt reasonable but it really is just economy class with the middle seat missing. There's nothing business class about this part of the journey. Transfer at Frankfurt pleasantly easy but boarding for the BKK flight quite chaotic. The flight itself was full but fantastic. We were served by the same Bangkok based crew member throughout, she was really friendly and professional, 10/10. Food was great, all choices available. I found the seats really comfortable and managed over 6 hours of good sleep. Can't criticise anything about this flight, just wish Lufthansa would bring their short haul up to a similar level.",Passive
" Frankfurt to Bahrain return in Premium Economy. A330 seating is a 2x3x2 layout with plenty of leg room and slightly wider seats than economy. A small amenity kit, and water bottle was provided, and a welcome soft drink in plastic glass. Soon after take off, a bar service was offered, followed by lunch, which was OK, and a snack just before landing. On my return flight, a tasty sandwich was served and later a hot breakfast. The scrambled eggs with Tandoori breast of chicken on top seemed a rather odd combination, and was rather bland. The seat back touch screen IFE monitor was easy to operate and had a limited selection of movies, both old and new. The crew although polite and professional were non-engaging, despite there were only eight passengers in the PE cabin. As for the seat itself, a few inches of recline, foot rest and adjustable head rest made the journey very comfortable for the 6 hour flight to Riyadh for a 45 minute stop and onto Bahrain. I thoroughly enjoyed this flight both ways. Even though the trip is longer via Frankfurt, it was much better (and cheaper) than a non-stop PE flight. And the price was extremely reasonable too.",Passive
" London to Frankfurt Business Class. I usually don't pay inflated prices for European Business Class flights, where it's just the economy seat with the empty middle seat. But I was on Premium Economy for the long haul part from Frankfurt to Bahrain, and was offered an upgrade to Business Class for the short haul sectors for a very low fee, which I took. And I was not disappointed. On boarding, I was greeted with a smile. The flight attendants were professional but not necessarily engaging, although they did address me by my name. No hot towel, welcome drink or IFE. But the food was excellent in both directions, considering it's an hours flight. Outbound was a tasty cereal with fruits and on return, a delicious tuna salad with hot bread and premium brand bar service, with refills. I really enjoyed these flights and was impressed with the good service. The seats, though hardly any leg room, surprisingly felt comfortable too. Both flights were on time. But I still would avoid paying Business Class fares on European routes. Checking prices (two days prior to departure), I noticed that the BC flight LHR-Frankfurt-LHR was only little cheaper than the fare from LHR-Bahrain-LHR on Premium Economy! I rated Value For Money as good, only as I was offered a good price for an upgrade.",Passive
" Vienna to Frankfurt as a connecting flight. If you are flying with a star alliance airline from Vienna airport, during the check in procedure or any concerns still at the airport, you will be served from the Austrian airlines team, which is treating you with not a good customer service.

Once in the plane, an A319-100, the welcome was really German and polite from the cabin crew. The seats were nice, actually comfortable with a small but good place also for the legs. As it was just a short, 1h 20 minutes flight of course they passed with some sandwiches and beverages, but they offered you how many beverages you wanted and as I was really hungry I asked the hostess if they had some sandwiches left and after literally two minutes with no hesitation she brought me two sandwiches, with a big smile in the face!

" Miami to Munich. How Lufthansa is a 5 star airline has always baffled me but this time I really got the confirmation. I will not blame them for the 3 hours we spent on the plane before departing on our outwards trip (MUC-MIA), there was heavy snowfall in Munchen and we had to wait for the runways to be cleared and the plane to be deiced. However, during those 3 hours there was no service at all. I wasn't expecting much, but a glass of water would have been nice though. Now, the A380s cabin is seriously outdated. And even though it's clear that the plane we flew on recently underwent a C-check, being repainted in the new livery, the didn't bother retrofitting the cabin, so you get a 10 year old in-flight entertainment system. The touch screen barely works, it's slow to respond and responds only to every 3rd of 4th command. And on the inbound leg (MIA-MUC) the control keys (volume, channel, reading lights) didn't work at all. The IFE also froze and reset several times. On the outbound flight some passengers had the IFE not working at all and although they announced on the PA systems that they reset it several times, it didn't solve the problem. We also landed with the cabin light on (they should have been turned down) due to the same electrical problem. The seats are quite uncomfortable and the pitch in economy is just bearable and there are large metal containers protruding in the leg area. I have flown on low cost airlines which had the same seat pitch. There were no amenity kits provided, which if I'm not mistaken, should be provided by a 5 star airline, even in economy (I have flown on ones that do). The food is also nothing to brag about, it's half decent but certainly expected more from such a prestigious airline. On our backward trip the crew arrived late (but again, not their fault since there was an accident and a traffic jam), however the boarding process was a total mess. People aligned according to their seat numbers, but then they decided to randomly close lanes and just board people wherever. There wasn't even a boarding announcement, just for first and business class. When they started boarding Economy and Economy Premium they just opened two random lanes. This meant that no one really knew what's going on and the random boarding made the boarding time unnecessarily long for such a large plane (people in the back which should have been first ended up waiting for people in the front to sit down, who should have been boarded last). The crew however is pleasant, smiles and does a good job. The pilots also seemed professional and seemed to have everything under control, despite quite rough turbulence at times. At least this time our bags arrived safe, this is a miracle for Lufthansa since they managed to break 2 trolleys on my previous flights. In conclusion, definitely not a 5 star airline and regret choosing them over the other 5 star airline with which I could have flown (despite the fact that my flight time to MIA would have been an hour longer since they operate from a different hub and would have had other connecting flights).",Passive

" Bangkok to London via Frankfurt. Lufthansa 2 for 1 business ticket offer. Flights fully operated by LH. Evening check-in in BKK. The trainee at the counter forgot to give us fast track cards for security/immigration which was quite a pain as it was a very busy night at BKK so we had to go back to check-in to collect cards. Security/immigration was quick and efficient. Boarding started on time and was very quick. Blanket and pillow was waiting at the seat and amenity kits were handed out shortly after, as were welcome drinks. Orders from bar were taken prior to take off but dinner orders were only taken after the seat belt sign had been turned off. Despite this dinner was completed in just 90 min after take off. The food was ok but nothing special. The seat, while lacking privacy and not being all aisle access, have to be the most comfortable seats I have ever been in. Whether sitting up, lying down or picking the ""relax"" position the seat was great. The entertainment system was great and easy to use with a good selection of movies and tv shows. Breakfast served prior to landing while ok was perhaps the least tasty meal of this trip. The intention was good but the whole dish had ended up being very dry and boring. The crew were quite non-descriptive as they were going through the motions and while not unfriendly they did not seem to engage at all, a very forgettable crew. Landing in FRA was on time. FRA-LHR was on time and a very average intra European business class trip. The crew here were quite a bit better than the long haul crew as they were fun and engaging and eager to please on the short flight.",Promoter
" Munich to Miami. Overall the trip was ok. The configuration of the seats on the aircraft is slightly too compressed, compared to other airlines with the same aircraft. There is no privacy between the seats and the comfort of the cushion was a really bad surprise, not what I was expecting from a business class seat. The service on board is in line with the expectation, really friendly and regardful. Wi-Fi service costs extra money, even with a business class ticket or for members of Miles&More which is disappointing. starting with 7 EUR just for the slow connection and going up to 29 EUR for the premium one. Considering the high price of the ticket, it could have been complimentary. The entertainment is ok, nothing special. The screen is quite small and not in a very comfortable position. The selection of movies is good, also the possibility to see the external cameras.",Passive
" Seoul to Manchester via Frankfurt. Lufthansa cannot be compared to other 5-Star Airlines and is a poor relation. The first leg was in a 20 year old 747-400, although clean, it is showing its age. Wifi did not work. The food choice was poor and poorly presented, the wine list consists of two reds and two whites, both very average. The seat comfort was not good and the placement of the screen disturbs neighbour who may wish to sleep. Frankfurt airport is a mess. Second flight on a A320 Neo, was not better, seats very thin? Business class seats same as economy but with middle seat empty, same legroom as economy. Buy two economy would be cheaper. Snack served. Ticket was keenly priced though.",Passive
" Frankfurt to Nairobi. Our flight UA 58 from SFO was late arriving in Frankfurt which caused my sister and I to run from one end of the terminal to another. I am 75 years of age and my sister 67. Once we arrived at the security check in, the guards further the delay causing us to miss our connecting flight to Nairobi. We were then told the next available fight would be the following day at the same time. We had to leave the secured area to contact personnel to reschedule our flight, which was a night mare in itself. Once at the ""Customer Service"" the agent rebooked us to flight to Heathrow and the onto Nairobi on Kenya Air. We arrived in Nairobi at 05:00 the next morning, having put a very long flight into a much longer flight. The last leg of our flight was from Cape Town to Frankfurt and then on to SFO. Because of the missed flight at the beginning of the trip my sister was unable to check-in online to secure her flight arrangements. After many frustrating calls to your 866 number and talking to someone who English was not understandable, we retired for the evening and called again the next day and finally spoke to someone who helped with confirming our flight and my sister was then able to check-in online. I have no idea what my cellphone fee will be for the call, but this could have been avoided if the error was not made it the first place and when you hirer someone ensure that they speak perfectly clear English. In the future, I will avoid booking any flights with Lufthansa.

" The complaint is not with the flight itself but rather with horrible post-flight service. And attitude. Snowstorm in Europe. Budapest departure delayed. Thus missed connecting LH MUC-DEN flight. Rebooked LH MUC-ORD-DEN. 2-hour wait. Boarded LH MUC-DEN. Told we had to wait at gate for people arriving from Greece. LH MUC-ORD departure thus delayed nearly 2 hours. Long time to sit on the plane. Thus, missed UA ORD-DEN connecton. At LH service desk in ORD, discovered my wife had been booked by MUC LH on LH ORD-LAX, not ORD-DEN. LH ORD told us only choice was to take AA flight next morning to DEN. As that was the only choice that LH offered, we accepted. LH put us up in a distant rather basic hotel. Arrived at AA (Terminal 3) early next morning to check in. Long line. Denied boarding. AA said LH incorrectly booked our AA tickets. We have to go to LH in Terminal 1 to sort it out. Thus missed AA flight. Arrived at LH in Terminal 1 and told they would not open for 8 hours. Went to UA, they tried to help. There was a UA flight at 8.45 to DEN. Why didnt LH book us on that instead of AA. UA called LH to get OK to write the ticket (Hey, Star Alliance, right?). LH agrees but disconnected before transaction completed. UA agent calls again. Starts to tell story, disconnect. Calls again, starts to tell story, disconnect. Finally he is able to tell the story and again request OK to issue ticket. LH says: NO! No? Yes, no. You have to go back to AA (Terminal 3) and ask AA to reissue the ticket to UA. But, wait, there is no valid AA ticket. That is the problem. In any event, if we go back to AA, we will miss the UA flight. So I buy the tickets, and I will ask LH to reimburse. UA prints out receipt and says surely LH will reimburse. After all, if the LH agent in ORD had been paying attention, he would have issued a ticket on UA and not AA in the first place. However, now, LH says no refund. Not even for goodwill. We have received off letters from LH about this. LH says the wait for passengers in MUC, the misbooking of my wife to LAX instead if DEN, the failure by the LH agent in ORD to find to the UA connection to DEN, and the improperly issued AA tickets in ORD were all due to bad weather in Europe. It took us 42 hours to get to DEN. I will try to avoid using LH in the future. The ground staff was incompetent and uncaring. The customer service agents are insulting by their dismissiveness (the replies are obviously form letters).",Detractor

" We flew in the middle of January and we were very disappointed that the arm rests on the window side of the premium economy seats wouldn't move, they were standard arm rests and there is no reason they shouldn't move. There is barely enough leg room for anyone over 6 ft. The crazy young lady in the front near the aisle reclined her seat (permanently on purpose) and my travel companion could barely get out to go to the bathroom without abruptly brushing her seat. Lufthansa flight attendants are not very attentive and take very little corrective action - they didn't notice the lady in front of us never brought her seat to the up-righted position during mealtime. The TV's are really nice in this class, and the entertainment selections are excellent. The food was no better than what you'd get in economy. Premium economy is not worth the cost you are better off in business class, which we flew in on our return trip. This is not a 5 star airline at all. Lufthansa is worse than any other airline in Europe.",Detractor

Lounge is just as the airport is, out-dated. But they did make an effort to modernise it apart from the lounge chairs, there old and worn out. There is priority boarding at the gate. After take off a decent lunch was served. For wine there was just the choice red or white, no different makes (as at Austrian).",Promoter

We arrived back in Toronto and were kept on the plane, there was some confusion as to whether we would be flying out that evening or being rebooked the following day. Through the entire ordeal the stewardesses were fantastic and patient as people were frustrated. They adjusted the problem with the plane and it was decided we would fly out, however, due to the delay many of us missed our connecting flights.

Seats were in a 2x2 set up. Announcements were made in English in addition to other languages. A trolley with complimentary drinks came by. I spied beer bottles and enquired the price and reached for my wallet. The flight attendant said there was no charge and went on to emphatically say, â€œI invite you to have a beerâ€ and with that opened a bottle, poured a bit into a plastic cup and placed both bottle and cup on my tray table.

" Berlin to Munich, with a connecting flight to Pisa. No prior warning about delays, we were all kept in the dark until the very last minute. A 40 minute delay, however by the time everyone had boarded and we were ready to take off, it was an hour and a half later. This meant I would arrive 20 minutes after my connecting flight to Pisa was scheduled to leave, and there was no delay on that flight. In Munich, we were told to go to the Lufthansa service center, there were around 20 desks with only 3 of them occupied for a line of 40-50 people. I was told I could either catch a flight to Frankfurt where I would be put on a waiting list for a flight to Florence, or put in a hotel. As I was in a rush to get away from this airport, I chose to fly to Frankfurt. This flight was delayed by an hour. I did not receive any food or drink vouchers, except a 60 cent gingerbread cookie. There was no food provided on the flights from Berlin to Munich, and Munich to Frankfurt. To make matters worse, the service was horrendous.

" Chicago to Belgrade via Frankfurt. Flights were fine but customer service was seriously lacking. We were initially delayed in Chicago for a day due to weather conditions. We confirmed with (and were assured by) Lufthansa staff that our baggage would arrive with us in Belgrade before we left on our Chicago flight. After a layover in Frankfurt we finally arrived in Belgrade. Of course, our luggage did not arrive as initially confirmed. We talked to airport staff and expressed our concern as our wedding attire was in the luggage and we were having our ceremony the following weekend. After dealing with airport staff we were sent home and told we would be contacted when our luggage arrived. Three days later we were told our bags had showed up but due to customs we would have to drive the 3 hours back to Belgrade to retrieve them.

"  San Francisco to Munich. First time my son and I decided to try flying in Premium Economy as we were flying with Lufthansa. In short, it isn't worth the money we spent. It was more comfortable than flying in Economy for the extra legroom, but it's nothing special. Differences between Economy and PE are that the meals are served on chinaware and one sits 55 plus rows in front of Economy, there is a complimentary bottle of water included as well as a small amenity kit with typical items. The kit has 'Cerruti 1861' on it not Lufthansa and was just okay. They serve a pre-flight drink (only orange juice) which I think should be varied. The drinks they serve with snacks or with meals are not individual mini wine bottles but from a large bottle. British Airways and Air France serve wine in individual mini bottles so prefer that better. The service was fine. We had very friendly flight attendants both on the outbound and inbound flights. Food was tasty. However, there are just two choices: Meat dish or pasta. And the portions are as small as a frozen meal. Everything was tiny from the tray to the chinaware. Bread rolls were at least warm but again tiny. The flight attendants put out snacks in the galley but one had to either know beforehand to expect them or just happen to walk past the toilets then notice them as there was no announcement made nor on the menu they handed out. However, the choices were either crackers, Lindt chocolates, and juices and water. Seating as mentioned above is roomy for legroom and a tiny bit widthwise. I found it problematic to recline. In fact, I could not figure out how to do so. And the tray table is folded so it is a bit of a nuisance to unfold and fold it back into the arm rest. If I weren't sitting next to my son I'd need to ask my seat mate if I could disturb them as this tray table folding/unfolding experience necessitated bothering one's seat mate's arm rest too. Worst part of the experience is that the toilets were only two for the entire PE section and they were filthy. Plus the crew seem to be stingy on toilet roll replacing. In fact, they only have one toilet roll from the beginning of the flight. Sometimes it ran out with no replacement timely. Also hand soap ran out and it took some time for them to refill it. I've flown British Airways and Air France which have bad aspects, however, at least their flight attendants were always replacing missing toiletry items regularly during the long flight. This was a connecting flight between Munich and Rome. Hated that we were not told that upon arrival in Rome we'd be landing on the tarmac and would need to take a shuttle bus to the terminal. It was cold and windy and frankly hard to maneuver the steps from the plane for me. Would hate to have an infant and/or small children in tow. All in all, I'd have to think hard if I want to spend another $2K for Lufthansa's PE in future. I just didn't feel it was worthwhile as it was not much different from sitting in Economy. In fact, they make it known that you're really in Economy as you have no special boarding privileges either",Passive

" Copenhagen to Houston via Frankfurt. This is my first long haul trip with Lufthansa after many successful short haul flights with them over the past couple of years. I have to praise them for a great experience, from booking, through check in to the flight itself. We sat on the top deck at the very back, economy on the top deck of Lufthansa is a small cabin with 5-6 rows so it felt very private and service was also very efficient and fast although there was only one cabin crew. As a 182 tall guy I found the seats to be the most comfortable economy seats I have sat in as my knees didn't touch the seat in front and I could stretch my legs comfortably underneath the seat in front. Crew came round with water/juice every half hour, and in between the galley was open and you could help yourself to soft drinks or even request beer/wine. The crew were excellent, and from this return trip I can understand why LH has earned the 5 star status.",Promoter

I had to do some change on the return flight for a family member, I dealt with the worst customer service, they hung up on me and refuse to be any useful to help with the issues. Also got charged $400 to add an infant lap ticket. Bottom line me and my family will not do business with Lufthansa again, stay away from such terrible customer service airline.",Detractor
" Tunis to Kiev via Frankfurt in June 2017. I went early to the airport for check in. The girl at the desk asked me typical questions about my visit and I provided her with all the needed information (visa, letter of invitation, passport) and everything seemed ok, until this agent came and took the passport gave it a glance then told me that I cannot attend this flight. I asked why, he replied that the money I have converted in dollars was not enough for the living standard in Germany (I must have with me an amount equal to 70 euros a day) I have answered that I am only staying in transit in Germany for a few hours, so the rules of the schengen visa don't apply for me, and I have shown that amount of money to the Ukrainian embassy and they accepted. Accommodation was covered during my stay in the host country and I was clear in the original letter of invitation that I have shown him. He seemed convinced after what I have said and he left. After a couple of seconds he came back and told me that I cannot leave because my letter wasn't in English or German, I showed him that It was original and written in Ukrainian because these were the requirements from the embassy of Ukraine but, the main words such as my name, passport number, place, date, program name, and other information like the accommodation that was provided were mentioned in English. Luckily I went to talk to other agents and they let put my luggage and go to attend my flight, while that agent denied his behavior and his acts.",Detractor

" Newark to Munich. Aircraft with newly designed interior. Though relatively new the headphone socket at my seat (31D) did not work. The entertainment system was shut down 45min before the flight ended. The friendliness of the cabin staff is a game of luck. Sometimes you get some nice words as a Senator. Not this time. At boarding the middle seat next to me was empty, but then someone else was re-seated there. On my proposal to re-seat the person to the next row instead (Premium Eco, completely empty) the stewardess gave me a rude comment and asked if I want to pay 400â‚¬. The vegetarian pasta was covered with a fat/tasteless clumpy cream sauce, the dressing was frozen.

" My parents were flying Newark to Chennai via Frankfurt today by flight LH403 and had wheel chair assistance. We completed our luggage and check in by 4pm and had to wait almost 2 hours to get wheel chair assistance. It was frustrating and painful since there was no restrooms, or water or food where we were asked to wait and there was hardly any coordination or commitment from the ground staff at the airport. My parents could not leave their seats since they were waiting for the wheel chair since they were not sure when they would get the assistance. My repeated enquiries with ground staff did not yield desired results - all they kept saying was be patient for almost 2 hrs. The supervisor said there is nothing they can do and told me there was no formal way for me to leave a written complaint. When I leave feedback I am being told to leave detailed email to customer relations with which I have similar experience earlier when I raised a complaint about charge on my credit card for re issuance of tickets.

" Hanover to Beijing via Munich. Flight HAJ to CKG via MUC/PEK, and return flight CKG to HAJ via SHA-PVG/MUC. Online booked at Lufthansa, the flight PEK-CKG was carried out as part of the Star Alliance by Air China with a LH flight number. In Hannover the luggage was labeled to CKG. I asked if the luggage had to be picked up in Beijing and re-boarded to CKG, I did not receive conclusive information in Hanover and at the boarding gate in Munich. The lady at the boarding gate in Munich has looked in the PC, but she was not able to give a conclusive answer. She just gave the advice to ask in Beijing! On my objection that I do not speak Chinese, she said that at the jetway when leaving the plane there are always someone with English language skills. That was not the case. Then, as a precaution, I waited for my suitcase on the luggage belt, which then came. The food of the flight section MUC-PEK can be classified as problematic. The first leg of the return flight, which I took with my wife, was done by Air China. The first leg was delayed by 1:40 hours due to fog in CKG. We had to fear for our connection in Shanghai, because an airport change from Shanghai Hongqiao to Pudong (around 60 km) was necessary. When we made our online booking only a terminal change was indicated for Shanghai. Later it was changed in an airport change. Air China was unable to obtain any assistance because of the delay. Then there was an altercation at the check-in CKG because of the number of luggage (2 pieces each 23 kg per person). Air China wanted to carry only 1 piece with 20 kg/person. Furthermore, it was forgotten to enter the passport number on my wife's boarding pass, as soon as the next trouble occurred at the security checkpoint. On the flight from Shanghai to Munich I had problems with the adjustment of the footrest. The adjustment knob often fell out of its holder, making the operation of the footrest problematic. The Purser has taken care of it professionally.",Detractor
" Beijing to Lisbon via Munich. Lufthansa has a very good service. I noticed some frustration by some staff in dealing with some people on the PEK MUC flight, so maybe they should be better prepared for the communication difficulties and the cultural differences. Food was great, but entertainment could be a tad more recent. Flights right on time. MUC LIS leg was overbooked but passangers were offered a rather good option if they chose to fly the following day. One slight detail: transferring within Beijing airport is beyond confusing and Lufthansa should take care of it together with their alliance partner",Promoter

Passengers applauded him and this created very pleasant environment on board. The seats were comfortable as usual. The staff was very efficient and attentive to passengers. Food and beverages were excellent for this medium haul flight. Overall a very comfortable flight, with an excellent crew and tasty hot dinner. I recommend Lufthansa as it is excellent company!

" Amsterdam to Frankfurt. The worst experience i have had with the airline in terms of emergency management. Weather was a bit rainy, so they cancelled the flight - almost no other airline did, but ok. Nobody from the staff knew what to do, how to handle the passengers. Took me about two hours to get hold of anyone. Lufthansa hasn't made any attempt at rebooking with another airline - said they tried with their partners (only partners), but those had no seats. Then they planned to book me for the next evening, took a lot of effort to have them book me for the morning - I had a venue to attend as a photographer, which I ended up missing. Then they booked the passengers into some hotel 50 miles from the airport, without providing transportation. Cab cost me 70 EUR each way - which they promised to pay back, but it's been over a month now, and I still haven't heard back - and it's impossible to get hold of anyone responsible for that, operators just tell you ""Oh sorry, hope they get back to you"".

 San Diego to Vienna via Frankfurt. The Lufthansa staff were very friendly and professional both at check in and onboard. The inflight food and entertainment was very good also. I do have issues with the comfort and seat side by side spacing in business. The seat was very hard and uncomfortable and even with the mattress it was still uncomfortable. There is no privacy between the seats and the common arm rests are an issue as I had drinks spilled on me on the SAN to FRA and the return. I normally travel BA and their business class seating is far more comfortable and the seats have privacy.,Passive

" Munich to Vancouver. Business Class Seat 8A on a new A350 is on my opinion is the best seat on this aircraft, the last row of Business Class, with only one row in front of it, and divider to Premium Economy behind. Lots of space, away from galleys and far enough from lavatories. Two things that are inconvenient - the aircraft is extremely noisy and the noise cancelling headphones, attached to seats in Business Class are very bulky and impossible to sleep in. Ear plugs don't help with the noise. I've done this route three times in the past year, and I always choose 8A on MUC - YVR leg. Service is impeccable, food could be hit and miss, entertainment is great and the aircraft is not good, but that's what Lufthansa flies on this route, hence I don't have much choice. There is one more thing - for some reason Business Class on long haul flights seems to be heated to the point of turning into a sauna on a long haul flights, I've noticed that on every flight. But otherwise I am a loyal Lufthansa customer.",Promoter

 Paris to Frankfurt. Very disappointing experience. I booked a ticket on Economy plus from Paris to Tokyo via Frankfurt partially operated by ANA. The main problem is that the Lufthansa website does not allow to choose your seat on the planes operated by ANA and online check-in is only available 24 hours before flight. Therefore you might get the worst seats on the plane. Most airlines allow you to at least choose your site on code shared flights but Lufthansa does not.

Upon arrival at the airport in Luxembourg, I had to find out, that Lufthansa has decided to use Air Nostrum aircraft as wet lease on this routing for a couple of months already, without ever feeling the need to inform customers of the change of service. Air Nostrum is a substandard low cost airline, normally operating on behalf of Iberia. Not even a Star Alliance partner. There was zero service onboard. Flight attendants were rude. They basically disappeared out of sight immediately after takeoff, only to be seen again for final landing procedures. This is in no way what I expected upon buying a Lufthansa flight.

" Athens to Frankfurt. This review is less about flight, more about poor information re landing at Frankfurt Airport. This is 1 of the largest, busiest airports globally and a major hub for Lufthansa. As this was an international flight with many non EU passengers, there was no information given by Lufthansa from the start to finish. Athens saw 3 gate changes, no big deal, no information as which terminal arrival would be, which carousel baggage could be collected from or any ground staff to assist with the immigration maze. I'm not stupid, but today I felt completely lost at Frankfurt Airport. The scary part is somehow I made it out. I have no idea how I managed that as not one person could or would assist. Not good enough Lufthansa. And the part I'm not looking forward to is my departure from Frankfurt Airport next week. Heaven help me, as no person at that airport will! Unacceptable by any measure. At both Athens and Santorini airports they had Airport Ambassadors to assist, coming around asking! Come on Germany you need to do better.",Detractor
" San Jose to Tehran via Frankfurt. I booked our ticket with this airline and was hoping my longer leg which was from San Jose to Frankfurt to be upgraded to Premium which I bet for. I had an option to submit my credit card now or later, which I did. Usually they send you an email to confirm that you have been selected and charge your credit card. A day before my trip I was notified that did not win the upgrade to premium economy. But at the same time find out that I have been upgraded the shorter distance to business class for 2 seats for $1500. I was in state of shock and panicked since this was not in my agenda. Right away contacted Lufthansa Customer Service and after being on phone to get connected for 45 minutes, I requested this is a mistake and very nicely asked them to correct and credit back my money. The customer service agent was very rude and not helpful and said this is a done deal and he cannot do anything. He said I can go to ticket counter and see if they can do any thing. I did write few emails and showed my concern and requested correct of action. At the same time I approached the ticket counter in San Jose and the agent was very nice and after 45 minutes trying to connect to Lufthansa customer service, he apologized that could not get anywhere and asking me to try in Germany's customer service ticket counter. I did the same thing and the rude agents in Germany by twisting my statement and putting 100 percent blame on me asked me to use the deal or lose everything (meaning lose your money and seats). I told them I preferred not to use the business portion since I can not do anything afterwards. She responded use it or lose it. So you see how I started my trip, with anxiety. After 3 month and 5 emails and phone calls finally I got a phone call from customer service telling me they can not do anything since I used the ticket and offered me $200. Can you believe these people. Anyway very unhappy with Lufthansa and their customer service and respond time. Will not use anymore.",Detractor

After leaving the A380 - huge masses of people were herding in every direction imaginable and no one from Lufthansa greeted the flight or was there to assist First Class passengers. Over an hour later, I managed to find my way to the First Class lounge where the agents were clueless and acted like I was expecting too much to expect assistance, even after I had asked about it and tried to confirm it would be available.

I assumed this wouldn't be a major problem considering it's not that uncommon to miss a connecting flight and assumed we would be put on the next flight out to Florence. To my dismay, we were told that it was our fault we missed the connection, that the airline was not informed of any delays or long wait times in customs or security and that we would not only have to buy a new flight, but the return home flights were also canceled because we missed the connection.

" Flew Newark to Kiev via Frankfurt, and returned from Vienna to Newark via Frankfurt with Lufthansa. The inflight entertainment system on the trans-Atlantic flights had a decent selection of movies and music, but my screen kept freezing and crashing, and had to be reset, on both long-haul flights. The food on the EWR-FRA segment was okay, but the chicken meal on the FRA-EWR flight was absolutely horrible. Decent bar service on both long-hauls though. The European flights offered a sandwich with beer/wine/soft drinks, few airlines offer any complimentary service on short-haul flights, so that was nice. My biggest complaint would be that en-route to Kiev, my suitcase was destroyed at Frankfurt airport so I had to buy a new one upon arrival in Kiev. Also, my VIE-FRA connection was too short to be comfortable, 45 minutes to connect at a huge airport like Frankfurt is really stressful. I just barely made it to the gate a few minutes before they closed the doors. My already short connection was made even shorter due to the fact that the flight from Vienna landed what seemed like several miles from the actual terminal, and we were then treated to a 15-minute bus tour of Frankfurt airport, so I ended up literally having to run all the way to my next gate. Overall, I'd still fly LH again, they're still better than any USA-based airline, as well as better than many European ones, but as a supposed 5-star carrier, they really need to improve the food on long-haul flights, work out the glitches in the entertainment system, and take better care of passengers' luggage.",Passive

" Orlando to Frankfurt. My flight out of Orlando on August 12th was delayed because of weather therefore I missed my connecting flight from Frankfurt to Split. When departing aircraft there was no help whatsoever on support of getting another connecting flight. Finally found a counter that was open with only 4 individuals working and approx. 80 people in line. After standing in line for 2.5 hours I looked up other flights going into Split and the only one left was at 1600 hours. I knew then that we would not make it if we continued to stand in the line that we were currently in. After going through customs into Germany we approached a counter that was loaded with individuals - on the other side there was only 2 lady's working so I spoke with an agent and told her my situation and she took care of us and was very helpful in explaining were we needed to go. We did make the flight thanks to her. I think Lufthansa needs to hire more people like her, excellent customer service!",Passive
" San Jose to Munich via Frankfurt. Zero options offered for breakfast, a foil-covered scrambled egg, tomato and sausage combination. Entertainment options were pretty meh. Coming from someone who is accustomed to United levels of service, I was pleasantly surprised that Lufthansa took the time to rebook me on the next available flight when the flight delay for my first leg caused me to miss a connection. As a result, I arrived earlier than I had planned.",Passive

" We were flying from Lyon to Philadelphia through Frankfurt. We had a very short layover in Frankfurt and our flight from Lyon to Frankfurt was delayed. The pilot announced several times that the flights from Frankfurt were also delayed and not to worry. Nevertheless, we ran as quickly as possible to make our connection to Philadelphia. The gate agents practically laughed at us and said that flight was long gone. The truth was we arrived at our gate at 1:45pm, the flight was delayed until 2:10pm (according to an email I received from Lufthansa) and did not actually take off until 2:30pm (according to FlightAware). Yet, Lufthansa did nothing to get us on that plane (I assume it was out on the tarmac - the busing around the Frankfurt airport to and from the planes is ridiculous). Instead, we had to go to customer service and were re-booked on a flight the following day. Customer service actually seemed annoyed that they had to deal with us. Then to make matters worse, the customer service rep said they would book us at a nice hotel in center city so we could see Frankfurt. The hotel was no where near center city - we were in some warehouse district that was not walking distance to anything. To get to center city was a walk and two bus rides away or a 40 euro round trip taxi ride. Ridiculous! The extra 24 hours in Frankfurt was awful and I couldn't wait to get out of there. It was seriously the most money I have ever spent on an airline ticket ($1900+ per person) and the worst experience I ever had. I have flown many times and have seen airlines go out of their way to make sure the passengers make their connections. Not Lufthansa. I would not fly with them again.",Detractor
" Seoul to Oslo via Munich. The new A350 felt some claustrophobic. For me I think almost all airlines need to work on the food. The portion is little if you are hungry for 10/11 hours.

" Berlin to Bangkok via Munich. I was booked onto Lufthansa as as I wanted a relaxed and relatively comfortable flight. First flight was ok. Got a beer a snack and was on time. Switched into the Bangkok flight in Munich and realised this was a Eurowings codeshare. If you want inflight entertainment you pay 9.90 EUR, a blanket 6 EUR, headphones 3 EUR. Apparently I had been booked in the SMART tariffs, so I got 1 alcohol drink and a spartan meal. Had to pay for my beer. When I asked how I get such service with Lufthansa, I was told I could see it was an Eurowings flight by looking at the flight Number. I understand Eurowings is a budget airline, however Lufthansa is not.",Detractor
" . I booked to fly with Lufthansa from London to Zagreb via Frankfurt on a Wednesday evening. The check-in staff told me that the first flight was delayed so I would miss the connection. The impression was this was very much my problem and I should speak to the reservations line. Reservations changed me to a flight via Vienna to stay the night in a hotel courtesy of the airline and fly to Zagreb early the next day. I was satisfied with this. I asked the check-in staff whether I should get the hotel voucher from them or from Vienna airport - they were clear that I should collect this from the Austrian Airlines representative at Vienna airport. On arrival at Vienna I was told by the Austrian Airlines representative that Lufthansa had put no information on their system relating to my needing accommodation for the night. They spent 20 minutes trying to contact Lufthansa reservations and were not able to - on speaking to a representative at the Frankfurt Lufthansa headquarters the Austrian Airlines rep was told ""that's not my responsibility"". There was a pop concert on in Vienna - there were no rooms or only rooms with inflated prices available and I could not afford the cost of a taxi to/from the city and a hotel myself. I approached two hotels in walking distance who told me they had rooms only accessible with a voucher. Austrian Airlines would not provide me with a voucher without Lufthansa indicating on their system that this was agreed. The rep apologised for the experience I was having due to Lufthansa but was unable to act without their ticking a box on the system. I spent the night on the floor of the airport. I emailed Lufthansa that night expressing my frustration and requesting compensation. I have heard nothing back over a week later and just spent 25 minutes waiting on their customer services line without getting through to a representative.",Detractor
" Florence to Bangkok via Frankfurt. I sent this note to customer service because of the sweetheart that helped me get home. After a delayed flight from Sofia to Frankfurt, I missed my connection back to Florence which in and of itself would not be a problem if I did not have another flight the very next day from Rome to Bangkok, ironically connecting in Frankfurt again. The flight was not on the same booking as I had taken a last minute trip to Bulgaria and felt comfortable giving myself one day in Florence before my flight back to Bangkok. What would have been a few busy days of traveling quickly turned into a nightmare. After a long walk to terminal B to the transfer counter, which I could not find and was not clearly marked, me and hundreds of other frustrated and tired customers got in line. Standing there I realized that I could potentially miss my return flight to Bangkok the next day because of a one hour delay",Promoter

" Berlin-Tegel to Munich. I tried to check-in via the App/website but that did not work as I was travelling with special needs. At the airport, I checked-in and wanted to change to an earlier flight in order to have more time for my connecting flight in Munich. Unfortunately, there is no Lufthansa employee in the entire Lufthansa check-in is area as it is handled by a third party and they could not help me. The Lufthansa ticket counter - which is at the other end of the terminal - also could not help me because it actually just is a ticket counter for all airlines instead of a specific Lufthansa ticket counter. I find it disappointing that there is no Lufthansa agent in the check-in area or at the ticket counter at Berlin-Tegel, an airport at which Lufthansa is the biggest airline. So I gave up and went to the Senator Lounge and found Tegels one and only Lufthansa agent on duty there at the entrance: She actually was very helpful but by the time I got there it was too late to change to an earlier flight. The flight itself was on-time because the crew was outstanding: They helped during boarding so that we got off the ground on time. They informed us about our connecting flights and did a great service. Very good onboard service. Very poor ground service at Berlin-Tegel.",Passive
" I had a flight from Munich to Frankfurt via Lufthansa then a connecting flight to Toronto via Air Canada. I missed my connecting flight due to delay in loading luggage. I was stranded at Frankfurt airport and had to find out what next to do. It was my first time missing a connecting flight. The staff at Lufthansa was knowledgeable and help direct me to the service desk (although it took a while, understandable due to the size of the airport). At the service desk, the employee was helpful and kind. I was giving a voucher for the hotel, dinner, breakfast, and transportation. They put me on the next flight to Toronto for the next day. This helped alleviate my distress and it showed that Lufthansa strived to do right by their customers when a mistake is made. On the flight, the staff and Lufthansa work hard to make the economy not feel like an economy cabin. We were given hot towels twice, headphones, blankets, snacks, drinks, and food. I've been to other airlines and they don't usually give out that much. It makes the flight bearable and quick. The in-flight entertainment was great, I've binge-watched the latest movie and was quite the happy flyer. Lufthansa has exceptional staff and I would definitely try to get future flights on their airline if possible.",Promoter
" New York to Stockholm via Munich. Ground service at JFK is horrible. I don't know if it's company policy, but they grilled me harder than any immigration agent. First, I couldn't even check in online because they asked me for a visa/permit to enter Germany, which wasn't even my final destination? I have a Hong Kong passport, not China and I don't need visa for schengen. They saw my ticket was for 5 months, so asked to see proof of my â€œresidency permitâ€ in Sweden. I showed them the letter from the Swedish migration agency, which obviously is mostly in Swedish, but they did not consider it enough or readable. Eventually, I managed to get past the counter via showing the Swedish school's acceptance letter. The only reason I gave 3/10 and not 1/10 is because of their air crew and service, which is good, and one of the ground personnel who knew German and helped me out a bit with the translation and arguing to let me pass.",Detractor
" Dublin to Frankfurt in business class. My experience was mixed, and certainly not what I would have expected from a five-star airline. Check-in in Dublin and the lounge in terminal 1 were fine. Boarding is where problems occurred. The plane arrived late from Frankfurt. This can happen and is not a big deal. We left and arrived about 30 minutes late. I would have expected the ground crew to offer some information and explanation to the lined-up passengers. This did not happen. We were just left to stand in line for 30 minutes. Part of that time was spent uncomfortably in the jet bridge. When I politely asked a member of the ground crew to explain what was happening, I was rebuked for my impertinence. Even stranger, during the flight there was no mention of the delay, as though this were perfectly normal. Service on board was acceptable. The food was quite nice, but it was served hastily, with little attention to detail. For example, I was almost finished with my food when drinks arrived.",Passive
" Beijing to Munich on Lufthansa. Checked in with the help of an agent who spoke minimal English and was eager to see me through. Used the Air China Business Lounge which was hot, stuffy and had no cold beverages. Boarding was delayed as with my most experience at Beijing airport and announcements were inaudible. Once aboard I had a choice of several empty seats so I picked a seat without a neighbour. The hard product is OK but not all seats have direct aisle access. All seats were supplied with a thin mattress and we were given sleeping shirts once airborne. The service was excellent with FA's checking on passengers frequently. The food was well presented but was uninspiring. The beverage selection was very good with a wide array of wines and champagne. The IFE had a large selection but could have used more recent releases. The location of the headphone jack is a total pain if one chooses to use his own headphones instead of those supplied. The flight departed late but arrived on time.

" MÃ¼nster/OsnabrÃ¼ck to KrakÃ³w via Frankfurt. Half an hour before departure there was an announcement that the flight to Frankfurt of 6:35AM was cancelled. So, we went back to the check-in desk. There we were put on the 2:40PM flight, 8 hours later. They did give us 10 euro per person for food and drinks, which was sufficient. After 8 hours of waiting it was finally time for boarding. However, this didn't go as planned either, because we had an aborted takeoff due to an overheated engine. We had a bit of hope that it would be fixed in 10 minutes, but after we were told that the luggage is on the carousel, we went back to the check-in desk again. This time we were put on the flight of 6:20PM, and also got an additional 22 euro for food and drinks per person. That quickly became 7:10PM after a delay. Then, 13 hours late, we finally took off to FRA on the 30 minute flight. Apart from this all, the flight was smooth and uneventful. FRA is a huge airport with lots going on, yet it is quite easy to find your way. The flight to KRK was on time and really smooth, and the drinks and sandwich were better than expected, and legroom was amazing, me being over 2m tall, so i can't fault the flight itself and how they handled the cancellation. I wouldn't recommend them though, since our flight was far from the only one being late/canceled.",Promoter

" Lufthansa's Economy Class is highly recommended, so good in fact that you should not bother to upgrade to its Premium Economy. This is the first time I flew economy with LH in some years, and I was very pleasantly surprised at the high level of service. Although the seats were a bit worn and long in the tooth, they were comfortable. Legroom and overall room was ample. Service was very good. The staff was very pleasant and efficient, Inflight Entertainment was generally good. There are a few glitches with their IFE system, and the selection is again good but not great.

" London to Frankfurt in Business Class. I got the advertised product along the whole trip in an efficient way. Priority security line, lounge access (four Star Alliance lounges available in LHR T2, its worth it to try them all), priority boarding, seating, meal service - it worked as you can expect it as a premium customer. The whole crew was doing a fabulous job. From my point of view, Lufthansa maintained the level of the product during the last two years. The only point is connectivity. They had a Wifi in this aircraft, but it is quite expensive, there is no difference between economy and business. As the flight is short, this is not a big point. Some plugs to charge the mobile devices would be nice. As I got a good fare, this flight was perfect value for money.",Promoter

Moreover, from time to time, the attendants walked through the aisles with a tray full of drinks (mostly water and juice). As I was hungry, I asked for some more crackers they served at the start and could take as much as I wanted to. The food wasn't excellent but sufficient for a 12 hrs flight. Its taste was okay.

" I intended to take a flight from Basel to Munich and transfer to another one to Split. The original transfer time was one hour and forty minutes, which is more than enough. However, the boarding time was delayed twice as I was waiting in Basel airport and the final estimated transfer time is only 25 minutes. So I asked the front desk what should I do in order to catch my second plane, and she couldn't give a useful answer, saying you should be able to catch it. As I got on board, I asked the crew several times about whether there is a fast track for transfer and whether they have further information about my second device. All the feedback I got was ""I couldn't give any information"" and ""sorry we don't have the device to check"". By the time I get off the plane, I still have five minutes to catch up. However, I have to take the shuttle bus and across the gate control. This is simply no way for me to speed up. I ran but was still ten minutes late for my second flight. So I have to go to the service center for the rebook. But the queue is super long. They only open up to 5 desks to serve hundreds of people. And the officials didn't even provide a place to live or a decent dinner as a compromise. This isn't my first experience of a tight transfer so I do have some example to compare. I remember when I took a Swiss airline from Beijing to Zurich, the plane was late due to frost for two hours. However, during the flight we kept get updated information from the crew. And as soon as I arrived at the Zurich airport, there are officials guiding us how to go and the transfer was really fast. Eventually everyone was happy about it. If the connection could just be a little more well organized, they could help me catch up my second flight and help many others.",Detractor

I'm sorry to report that not only have the standards in flight service dropped, there no variety of snack foods in the galley between meals. Last time there were apples, chocolate bars, crisps and biscuits. And the food during mealtime (I have low fat meals) was less. SQ seats (due to the lower leg support and the foam in the seat itself) is in my opinion more comfy. And the noise cancelling headphones in SQ make a difference. The crew was friendly, personable and efficient. They were just let down by what LH was supplying. The DUS-FRA flight was cancelled via email/sms 5hours prior. Upon arriving at DUS to see what alternatives were available as nothing had yet been listed in the LH App and LH disconnected my attempted phone call 5 times whilst in waiting queue, they were most apologetic and had our complimentary replacement ICE High Speed train tickets to Frankfurt printed out and ready to go, along with a time table, within 10mins, which was much appreciated. The LH only check-in located directly upstairs from the FRA airport train station was also handy.

" Munich to Incheon. Being German and a frequent flyer of Lufthansa I am very critical towards this airline. Lufthansa kept improving and catching up the last couple of years though. I think now they did it and my last experience was just outstanding as I flew Munich to Seoul with business class. The plane was a brand new A350-900. A mattress has been provided and a Pyjama that made the flight very comfortable. The entertainment was massively improved: at least twice as much movies and programs have been added to system, that contains interactive maps. Last but not least, and which is most important was the crew. The crew was not only very professional (which is state of the art @ Lufthansa) but attentive. Even though the level of Singapore Airlines or Emirates is not reached yet but the Lufthansa crew kept taking care of the passengers the whole flight. Lufthansa merits the 5 star rating if all flights would have the same level as I experienced during this one. To be improved is the seat though. It is too tight, too inclined and lacks of storage capacities and electronics connections. I heard that Lufthansa is working on that. Looking forward for it.",Promoter
" Victoria-Vancouver-Frankfurt-Geneva on 24 April 2018, returning 10 May. Economy class booked through Lufthansa website, with advance seat selection. YVR-FRA 10-hour intercontinental segments were mainline LH flights using Boeing 747-400s. YYJ-YVR 20-minute connecting flights by Air Canada used Dash 8-Q400 turboprops. FRA-GVA 1Â¼-hour connecting flights were an A-319 and a CRJ-700. I customarily book in Lufthansa's Premium Economy, but their 747s have only four rows of seats and the only PE seats left were in the front bulkhead row, which aren't worth the cost. (In that front row, although you have extra knee room, you can't stretch out your legs fully because there are no seats in front of you.) As well, in the armrest you have not only the tray table but also the IFE screen, which is half the size of screens in other PE seats. So I booked regular economy class. My seats were 49A outbound and 48K on the return. Booking those window seats cost Can$49 each way and were worth it, as they let you stretch out your legs fully under the seat in front of you. FAs were very good. Two meals were served, the main one after take-off, the second 90 minutes before landing. The meals were LH's two standard economy stodge options â€“ vegetarian pasta or chicken. The second meal was an omelette before midday arrival at FRA, and beef stew or pasta before afternoon arrival at YVR. Connections as offered on LH website were tight, about two hours each way through FRA. Nevertheless, my luggage arrived with me both times. The only hitch was that LH and AC use different booking codes. After booking my trip on the LH website I had to telephone LH to ask for the Air Canada booking code, which I needed in order to do the initial check-in at YYJ.",Promoter

" Los Angeles to Malta via Munich last month, then back via Munich. Although Lufthansa's boarding procedures are wonky and our flight was late as a result, once on board Lufthansa, I never really have any complaints. The food is decent, drinks plentiful, and seats are about as comfortable (uncomfortable) as you would expect. Lots of in-flight entertainment options, which is good. The way back through Munich was a mess. For whatever reason we couldn't check in online. We called and were told we could check in at the airport the next morning at the airport to get our boarding passes, then do the same again once we were in Munich. This went OK for the first short flight, but horrible for the connection. The Lufthansa service desk in Munich wouldn't print our passes and sent us to the gate without alerting anyone. Lufthansa has an extra security check-in before the gate, and those employees didn't want to let us through without a boarding pass. This resulted in about twenty minutes of additional delay with three other confused Lufthansa employees. We finally made it to the gate where we were then reprimanded by another Lufthansa employee for being late for boarding. She refused to sit my husband and I together (?), so we were placed in separate aisles. Once on board the flight, the seat I had been given was in between a woman and her two children. She asked me to move, which I did. The row behind my husband's assigned seat was almost empty, so we ended up sitting there together. Essentially if you enjoy taking care of a bunch of customer service fails yourself, this is a great airline. Personally, I probably wouldn't fly Lufthansa again.",Passive
" Lufthansa CityLine uses this aircraft type frequently on the MUC-BRU route and others and it is to be avoided. The cabin is the most uncomfortable IÂ´ve experienced, the seats are so narrow you have to squeeze yourself into them. Also, no business-class fast-lane security in MUC despite the fact that this is being advertised and included in the price for a business clas ticket. The quality of the food on this flight was rather sub-standard, announcements in German and English only, no French or Flemish. Cabin crew super friendly as usual with Lufthansa but they canÂ´t make up for the substandard seating and other flaws. All in all, avoid Lufhansa CityLine and the Bombardier Regonal Jet if you can.",Detractor
 Copenhagen to Munich. Lufthansa does not offer a fast lane at Copenhagen Airport for Business Class or star alliance Gold. That was quite inconvenient and the regular security took more than 20 minutes. SAS Lounge is not that good. Gate area old and dark and far a away. Flight on Lufthansa Cityline was uneventful. Crew was okay. No WiFi or entertainment. Considering that the flight was operated by a regional jet the seats were spacious and reclined. Verdict: good airline. CPH is not good.,Passive
" I was travelling from QKL (Cologne Central Station) to CPH (Copenhagen) with Lufthansa via FRA (Frankfurt). The first leg of this trip was operated by Lufthansa Air Rail, which is a train service. While Miles&More Senators/HON and Lufthansa Business Class customers are allowed to use the DB Lounge at Cologne Central Station, this service is not provided to Star Alliance Gold customers. Still, I find the 50-minutes train ride from downtown Cologne to Frankfurt a very convenient alternative compared to flying. What I do not like is that there are no check-in agents at Cologne Station anymore â€“ they have been replaced by a check-in machine. So it is not possible to make changes to the ticket: No change of flights, seats, frequent traveller card or APIS when flying to the US. Security at Frankfurt was very quick and I went directly to the lounge closest to my departure gate in the A terminal (A30). It was a business class lounge and had a really good selection of food and I nice tarmac view. It even had showers (which I did not use). I found it better that the Senator Lounges. The flight from FRA to CPH was fully booked in Economy, so no free middle seat. Nice crew, a bite to eat and two drink services (1h15m flight!). All in all a good experience. No obverhead screens or personal device entertainment available on this Lufthansa flight. WiFi was available for a charge. Verdict: Good flight, good airline. Would choose them again. Lufthansa should introduce personal device entertainment and check-in agents in Cologne.",Passive
" Basel to Algiers via Frankfurt. I hardly see any value in buying a business cabin ticket with Lufthansa. There was a long bus transfers in Frankfurt airport and you need to travel in the same packed bus waiting until the last passenger is out of the plane. No free internet in the cabin, you need to pay same as a economy passenger. Seats the same and service not so different than the economy cabin. No priority boarding in practice, as they give priority to passengers with kids, which practically means almost half of the cabin so you need to wait in the tunnel to aircraft 10 minutes without A/C. It's normally OK, but if you are paying 4 times the price for a business ticket you definitely expect a better service. No inflight entertainment also in the business cabin, no screens no videos.",Detractor
" I am a frequent flyer with animals to Europe and every time I travel with LH I have problems. The last two times I was quoted prices for my dogs and when I arrived at the airport the price was different. I have filed a claim and have had absolutely no satisfaction. When I calculate my travel I include the cost of the dog and my ticket purchase to determine which airline is most economical, this last trip the over charge was in excess of $500. I have friends that also travel to Europe with dogs and they were charge the amount I was quoted on the phone, so I don't understand why I was charged more. I have submitted to the claims department their payment document and mine to show the error, but still no response. LH has a problem with their Service center that needs to be address. I just spoke with someone a few minutes ago after a long hold period and was hung up on. I don't know what it takes for this airline to address my issues.",Detractor
" Athens to Hamburg via Munich, returning from Frankfurt in 0April. The food was mediocre to bad, the service was, overall (although there were a couple of notable exceptions), mechanical or indifferent (at best), sometimes bordering on downright rude. Once the food was served, on all 4 flights (with the partial exception of FRA-ATH), service was non-existent. We were not proactively offered anything (drink, etc) on flight ATH-MUC, the curtain between Business and Economy was left open for most of the flight, with the result that the Business class lavatory was used by people from Economy. None of the cabin crew tried to stop them. Surely one of the benefits of flying a Business class cabin is to have a dedicated bathroom? The boarding process was chaotic - any notion of priority boarding was a joke. On 1 flight by the time we boarded, other passengers had filled the storage space. Since we were seated at seats 2D and 2F, where we had no option but to store everything in the overhead lockers, I believe that someone should have made sure that people on the other rows stored things under the middle (empty) seats. To his credit, the steward very kindly helped us find a solution - no pre-flight drinks were offered, on one flight no menus were offered. We were offered a choice of ""meat"" or ""paella"". Why should people pay the (significant) difference in price and travel Lufthansa Business, at least on flights within or close to Europe?",Detractor

At the airport the staff was very unhelpful and was told to search for the Lufthansa counter and try and change the ticket. I did and queued for 2,5 hours. After that I managed to get on a Finnair flight with poor seating and poor service. No food voucher was given or no apologies and worst of all no Lufthansa staff helping or advising. Just queuing and poor service. And flight back was also delayed by 1,5 hours and extremely slow service on the counter with 1 person only working. What can I say...disappointed.",Detractor
" Shanghai to Istanbul via Frankfurt. LH733 from PVG to FRA. The flight on a Boeing B747-400 went smoothly and on time (arriving 30 minutes ahead of schedule). Beside the noise coming from A/C, no complaints about the flight conditions and service, the crew aboard welcomed all with a smile I could feel that customer satisfaction was the utmost priority and that the team was ready to fulfill all requests even if out of the ""standard protocol"". Transit in Frankfurt again a disaster due the security check. Early morning again 45 minutes as priority traveler in the fast lane. Frankfurt should take some consultancy of Brussels BRU airport, the security check goes much smother there. At 0530 all or most of shops still closed and I went to the LH lounge. Great lounge, super breakfast choices and staff. LH 1298 from FRA to IST was ready on time for departure and. The aircraft was new and cleanliness in the cabin was satisfactory.

" Istanbul to Shanghai via Frankfurt. LH1299 from IST to FRA. Organization of the check-in desks was just fair and nothing special for an 5* airline. Airbus A320 aircraft with standard LH economy seats, nothing special and not really comfortable for an 150 minutes flight. Service was OK, food tasty. No inflight entertainment! I had 75 minutes until my flight to Shanghai, which should have been plenty of time. I had to transfer from bus gate B to another gate Z within terminal 1 which was fine, it only took a few minutes. But then I got to security where there was a long queue ta â€œFast Laneâ€. I spent 50 minutes as priority customer in the queue waiting to go through security. Only half the security lanes were open causing the long queues. Staff were slow, lazy and rude. I am a frequent Star Alliance Gold traveler and I have never experienced such delays, or incompetence at airport security. LH728 from FRA to PVG Shanghai Pudong.

" Lufthansa Premium Economy from Frankfurt to Hong Kong. Very convenient flight for a reasonable price. The Premium Economy seats are comfortable: They offer more personal space, legroom and recline than standard economy seats, and I managed to get some rest on this red eyeflight. Unfortunately, Lufthansa only offered a choice between two meat dishes for dinner (same on the return). However, the service was very friendly and accommodating. The flight attendants went out of their way to organise a Vegetarian dish for me. The food that I got was very tasty and definitely above average for Economy (Lufthansa serves Economy meals in PE, even though they come on china plates). Happy to fly Lufthansa again.",Promoter

" Houston to Moscow via Frankfurt. Worst A380 layout I have flown. LH management should compare layouts of Singapore, Emirates, Qatar, Etihad, Korean, Thai, or even the 777's of EVA, ANA, Asiana etc. All are superior. Have not flown LH since my last Business class A380 experience a few years ago. Seats did not lay flat, so you constantly had to push yourself up from the foot rest. Fell victim to advertising that the new seats lay 180 degree flat, but I won't return. LH uses a 2x2x2 layout, rather than a far superior 1x2x1 of other5 Star Airlines. EVA & others offer 1x2x1 on their 777's. Seats on the LH A380 are the most narrow of any A380 I've flown. Tiny foot space. No privacy dividers between seats, unlike most 5 Star airlines, so it is a crowded feeling. Seats are low back, so you can view the TV screens of every other passenger if you are in the rear of business class. Very distracting. Do not understand why LH consistently fails to select high quality seating? Seat controls are on top of the arm rests, so if you lower your seat to sleep, you must crawl ""up out of the hole"" to make adjustments. Who thought this was a good design feature? Inflight personnel offer professional service, but are let-down by poor catering & cleaning. On the IAH/FRA segment I was seated in 2nd row of Business & 3rd row on the FRA/IAH return, yet on both flights there was NO entrÃ©e selection when the flight attendant came to take the meal orders. Catering had apparently failed to properly cater the flight in both directions, so there was zero meal selection. You just had to take whatever they had boarded. The printed menu is another joke. There is NO consistency to LH's printed menu, & the food you may receive. On the FRA/IAH segment the menu listed ""traditional Italian ice creams"". What was served was yogurt with granola. Is this another mistake by catering? The cleaning crew in Frankfurt could use updated training. Side business class storage compartments were filled with assorted trash. LH has also totally given up on any pretense of offering a quality amenity bag. Worst of any business class flight I have flown. Also agree with several other reviews that LH should be sued for ""false advertising"" regarding their non-existent business class service on many shorter routes. On many routes their business class is nothing more than the same seating in coach - 3 across with the middle seat being unoccupied. No added leg-room or amenities. The LH Business class lounge at FRA is mediocre at best. For breakfast there were no pastries offered. Just some powdered eggs, selection of cold cuts & cheese, & some cold hard bread. This is LH's top offering to Business class passengers? Wewill stay with Asian & Middle Eastern Airlines for our long haul International travel whenever possible. I will say LH is better than UA, AA & DL, but that is nothing to brag about. At least the flight crew kept the bathroom clean & tidy. Waited 40 minutes for our bags upon IAH arrival. Apparently ""priority"" bag tags have no meaning at LH. 2 flights were 3+ weeks apart, but entertainment was identical in both directions.",Detractor
" Detroit to Chennai via Frankfurt. One of the worst customer service you will experience. Myself and my 15 month old daughter are traveling from Detroit to Chennai via Frankfurt. When we reached the airport, they checked in the bag and when they checked the passport, they found that my wife cannot travel as there is a new rule that if you have a layover in Frankfurt, we need a valid schengen visa or a US stamped visa. We told Lufthansa that you never told us anything while booking the tickets or even when i called them to pay for the seat allotment as Lufthansa charges person for getting the bassinet seat (Most other airlines provide it free if you book the flight with infant). Lufthansa just want to get the money from you and never provide any information. The person at the check in counter said it is in our website and i asked him to show it, he went and wandered for 15 minutes and said he lost the sheet which had that information. I checked their website and nothing says about the rule. They mention that if you have two layover within Europe you need schengen visa, but not for a single layover within Frankfurt. And the person in the counter said, if you have booked the ticket through Lufthansa, the customer service should provide me alternate route. So, i called the customer service as i booked the flight through Lufthansa.com. When i called Lufthansa customer service, they told me that they cannot do anything apart from cancelling (which i dont get any refund) or postpone the flight to some other day so that i can go and get schengen visa. I am speaking to them saying getting schengen visa takes days and my wife and daughter has to travel within couple of days. The customer service person said they cannot do anything. So, i went back to the check in counter and the person over there called the supervisor who made a call to customer service of Lufthansa and explained the situation. Lufthansa finally said they can put us in another flight with a huge layover everywhere and also it cost us $1500 more as it is considered as one way flight and we need to pay from our pocket. I have been going through all this mess in the airport and took almost 4 hours with the 15 month old baby sitting in the airport. I decided not to fly with Lufthansa as they treated really really bad and went to Qatar Airways and flew with them, who provided excellent care for the baby and myself. But Lufthansa didnt stop there, they charged me extra for missing the flight and also charged me more as my return flight is with Lufthansa. So, i ended by paying more than $3500 for the entire flight from Detroit to Chennai and my return flight. The person in the check in counter said, they see same scenario everyday (at least 2 people every day). Lufthansa is making free money from 2 people at just one airport and i am imagining how much money they make from all the airport around the world. They charge people when they knew that they cannot fly and also charge them more whey they miss the flight due to Lufthansa mistake. While booking the ticket, why cannot Lufthansa mention this. Lufthansa mention that you need to have a valid schengen visa is there is multiple layover within Europe. If you can say that, why cannot Lufthansa say that if you don't have a valid US visa or a Schengen visa you cannot have a layover in Frankfurt. Lufthansa just want to get the money out of you and don't care about their customer. Their customer service is the worst i have ever dealt with.",Detractor

" Gdansk to London via Munich. When I purchased the ticket, there were flights with either about 45 minute connection time or about 3.5 hour connection time at Munich / Frankfurt airport. 3.5 hour seemed quite long so I chose connecting flights with 45 minute layover. If Lufthansa sells the tickets, the transfer should be possible. In fact, I had less than 30 minutes to transfer as the boarding for the 2nd flight closed 15 minutes prior to the departure. When my first flight arrived in Munich, I had to run. But there were so many people in the queue to go through the security and then passport control. It would take more than an hour or two to get to the gate! But then I realised from the live departure board that my flight to London has departed. As that was Lufthansa's last flight to London on that day, I had to wait until the next day to fly back. There was a long queue at Lufthansa's service centre as well. They arranged a hotel for me to stay near the airport with taxi vouchers. The airport hotel didn't turn out to be so near the airport and the taxi driver was horrible to me. There was a hotel at the airport, Lufthansa should have arranged a room for me there. They should not sell connecting flights with such unrealistic layover time. I tried to complain to Lufthansa, however, their website didn't allow me to do so. So I emailed their customer service. They acknowledged the receipt but I haven't heard from them since then.

Unfortunately the seat I booked was in a row of three behind a row of four so that when sitting I faced the gap between the two seats in front of me and had to sit at an angle in the seat to view my entertainment screen. Otherwise though the flight was very good. We were served dinner shortly after take-off, breakfast in the morning and a snack before landing. The food was all decent airline food.

" Frankfurt to Florence. Everything was ruined by Lufthansa. We have arrived to Frankfurt airport, check in, passed security control, and we waiting for boarding. 15 minutes before flight they said that flight is canceled and we have to go to a counter. We went to counter. There was long queue. It was approximately 20 flights canceled, due to bad weather. So after 1.5 hour in the queue we have reached counter. Staff was quite rude, they told us to go to another counter in departure area. We went there. There was several times longer queue. Here we spent approximately 5 hours prior to reaching counter. Here staff was more friendly. They put us on waiting list for 8 a.m. flight and give vouchers to hotel. Next morning we have repeated exercise. In boarding area they told us that it is 40 people on waiting list and only two seats, so we have to go back to counter. I ask, is it possible to talk with manager. Answer was quite rude: go to counter and there will be your manager. We run to counter. This time we reach it in 40 minutes. They rebook us on waiting list of 11:50 flight and told us that at noon air dispatchers strike in Italy will start. There I realized that we may reach Florence by some miracle this evening, otherwise we may not get there even till our train to Verona. We decided to change plans and cancel our flights to Florence and from Verona. They told us that we have to go to different counter on second floor. Another hour waiting and we are again in front of window. They told us that here we can only cancel flight, but to start procedure of returning money I have to go to site and feel up some request. They told us that we may get our luggage in half an hour to one hour. Of cause, it took us 2.5 hours to get it. Mean while I feel up that form. It was not from the first attempt that I was able to submit it. To summarize our experience: of cause there could be different circumstances, like weather conditions, strike etc., but it would be good attitude to send manager to each canceled flight area and talk with passengers, figure out their needs, try to find some solutions. Nothing of this was done. In addition to that normal companies did not canceling flights due to temporary weather conditions, just postponing it. And for sure making client wait hours in queue and kicking them from one counter to another just because managers don't want to look for a solution is extremely bad attitude.",Detractor
" Lufthansa does not have flights between Cologne and Frankfurt but offers a service that is operated by Deutsche Bahn (train service). While there used to be a staffed check-in counter at the train station, it was replaced a couple years ago by a self check-in. That means there is no agent anymore and flights cannot be changed. I find that disappointing. The service itself is good because the train station is in downtown cologne (and the airport isnÂ´t) and the trains are punctual. Lufthansa is using a dedicated train car, but no food or drinks are offered in economy class on this 1-hour train ride. Wifi and personal device streaming are free of charge.

They emailed confirmation of cancellation without any acknowledgement of the refund in writing. 6 weeks, 6 phone calls and an email inquiry later, I am still waiting. It took over a week for someone to respond to my urgent inquiry, with a generic, unhelpful response. The call centre staff have been completely unwilling to take my situation seriously and don't seem to understand the aspect of holding onto funds for which they are not providing a service.

" Los Angeles to Amsterdam via Frankfurt. The 747-8 is an interesting plane to fly, it's new and a classic at the same time. Unfortunately flying it in economy is just awful. I was seated in row 16, the first row of a mini cabin between club and premium economy, where seats are sold at premium prices. The seats are cramped and ergonomically wrong, not a chance to get comfortable. IFE could be good but malfunctioned in about every way it could, so gave up on that. The insult after injury was the main meal: a tinfoil container half filled with a mix of overcooked macaroni with mayo! The German kitchen is not known for its delicacies but this was simply terrible. Tasted like a mix of metal and nothing. A passenger was apparently smoking-where and when it is of course not allowed - but to wake up 400+ passengers with an incomprehensible long and loud rant by the lead FA in the middle of the night was not appreciated or professional. Also bags did not make the flight and although Lufthansa keeps emailing you on every element of the trip (like gate changes), they didn't bother to inform us our bags were never loaded in LAX, why? Needless to say we were not too impressed by Lufthansa and consider this flight and airline as bad as it can get these days",Detractor
" Paid $10,000+ for first class Washington to Istanbul via Frankfurt. Flights there via Frankfurt were fine. Decided to return a couple days early so called to change flights.

I ask for explanation and none given. I then for cost to cancel the entire return trip and it is $900. This made no sense so I decided to go to the airport to talk to a human being face to face. Lufthansa has their Istanbul airport office and I get some service counter agent who basically has to call and hold just like I did from hotel. Another 20 minutes to be told to change the Istanbul segment would be $2,400! If I were to purchase a business class ticket today from Istanbul to Frankfurt it is $350? So why $2,400? No explanation from anyone. I am calling again now and holding. 20 minutes get an agent who will check and again 30 minutes and still holding. I will never fly Lufthansa again.",Detractor
" This is my 3rd bad experience with Lufthansa in the last 3 months and I think I need to share it. I was travelling Business Class from Zagreb to Frankfurt and then to London with a layover in FRA of 1hr 45min. Boarding at ZAG was done without priority boarding. When landing at FRA the pilot lost his way around the airport and took about 20 minutes to park at a remote stand. Not only no separate bus was used for C class passengers, but instead all passengers were squeezed like sardines into one single bus. When I reached Terminal A I had to walk for over a mile and take a train to make it to gates B where my flight for LHR was departing from. I have never before had to go through security again during a transfer when travelling within Europe, yet Lufthansa decided to send me through a route that required security screening again. The queue for the security was one of the longest I have ever seen in my life. As a business class passenger and Star Alliance Gold member I attempted to enter the Fast Track. A lady standing at the entrance refused entrance to me saying just ""No"", despite me showing her my C class boarding pass and my gold star alliance card. I asked her three times whether Lufthansa does not allow passengers to use fast track any more and she kept telling me one single word, ""No"". I waited in the normal security queue for 40 minutes and that left me no single minute for lounge access. When I reached the gate, boarding just started and no priority boarding was used again. The Lufthansa agent just opened the gate and said ""please go"" and all passengers just run towards the plane. There are not a lot of benefits for business class European flights. People pay a significant additional amount of money to get a couple of extra benefits which it appears that Lufthansa refuses for no specific reason. What should have been a comfortable layover turned out to be a nightmare for me and a gap of nearly 2hrs between the flights disappeared. I have experienced inconsistent and bad service from Lufthansa both on the ground and in the air in another two occasions recently and this is enough for me to say that I would not recommend this airline to anyone and certainly don't waste your money to pay for business class because it is questionable whether you will receive any of the benefits at all.",Detractor

" One of the best airlines I have flown. I started my journey in Seattle and travelled to Zurich via Frankfurt, Germany. I had flown with them a couple of times before, all positive experiences, and I was looking up to my flights. The ground staff were excellent, although I was a little disappointed to find out that Seattle Airport doesn't offer any bag wrapping options. The ground staff was very friendly and helpful. After I checked in my bag, I headed to the lounge. Although it was crowded and not Lufthansa's own lounge, it was a great lounge. The seats were very comfy, WI-FI was fast, food was good, and the staff was very friendly. Boarding started on time and in the correct order. Boarding went very smooth, and as soon as I boarded, I was welcomed to the purser. The food was great and seat very comfortable. I slept great and enjoyed my meals. Lufthansa's staff is outstanding. A man sitting next to me was very inpatient and kept complain about the fact that the person behind him got his meal first even though he had a higher status. I would have already stopped serving, but the crew kept smiling and putting up with his moaning. My flight was great and I would definitely recommend it. After I landed in Frankfurt, I had a 4 hour layover until my connection to Zurich, but it went great and very smooth. As I was very tired, I headed to the lounge to rest, but after the lounge staff saw I was almost sleeping in my seat, they offered me a bedroom with a shower. The bed was perfect and the room looked like a 4-star hotel. The shower was outstanding and I was impressed with the service. After my rest, I headed to my connecting flight to Zurich. This flight also went very smooth and the food was great. After I landed, I accidentally forgot my iPhone on the plane, but before I had even noticed I left it, the flight attendant came running through the terminal to give it to me, I was amazed.

By doing that, I lost the privilege of the services of Premium Economy and reduced flyer program points. I purchased the more expensive Premium Economy ticket with Lufthansa and was downgraded to a less expensive economy class. After the trip, I contacted Lufthansa and they refused any compensation associated with this trip. This is an extremely bad experience with Lufthansa. It is not worth the money to purchase Premium Economy Class since you spend the money but you may not be able to have the services of Premium Economy Class when there is a delay in flight that is not your fault.",Detractor
" Frankfurt to Athens. Staff at Gate was very friendly and helpful. Also the cabin crew worked fast and was very friendly. Unfortunately this aircraft was not prepared for Lufthansa Inflight Entertainment like the most aircrafts of Lufhansa, so it was not possible to use the Lufthansa App that provides several entertainment options. I am really disappointed about the seats. The seat was too thin and too short. All Lufthansa singlle aisle aircrafts have this type of seats. This was not a pleasure as the flight take 2 hours and 30 minutes and I had some pain at the lower back area and thigs. I guess for a shorter flight the seat is ok, but for flight of more than 2 hours it can be very unconfotable to sit on such a seat. The menu/food was ok, the tast more bland than nice. I expect more from a 5 star airline, especaially in business class! There was only one choise of coffee, filter coffee. No further coffees available like espresso or cappuccino other airlines offer in business class and same typ of aircraft, single aisle. And the service has been done with foof and beverages trollies, this is fine but at some shorter flights within Europe Lufthansa has a signature service. I just do not understand when the principle when do they offer signature service and when the service is with trollies. However both are good for me. In general I would always recommend Lufthansa but the value of money for business class should be significantly better.",Passive
 Houston to Athens via Frankfurt. My experience was horrible. They cancelled our international flight from Houston to Frankfurt 45 minutes before boarding time. Their cancellation caused us so many consequential damages costs. We contacted them explaining the situation but they said they were not willing to pay for our consequential costs. They did not offer a voucher as a sign of apology or compassion. A total chaos in the gate as well. They did not make any announcement for the cancellation and we had to be notified by expedia through a text message. Ground staff was horrible in helping people booking the next available flight (we had to fly the next day).,Detractor
" Marseille to Berlin via Frankfurt. First flight departed late due to ATC strikes. Second flight was cancelled for unknown reasons, possibly weather. Upon arrival in Frankfurt, I went to the Service Center for rebooking. 20 minutes waiting time. The staff who took my case was friendly and efficient. Lufthansa paid for a meal, taxi, and hotel to spend the night in Frankfurt. They let me pick my replacement flight. The hotel was very nice. Replacement flight departed late but landed on time. Return flight to Frankfurt departed 30 minutes late. Connecting flight was 2 hours late (lots of delays in Frankfurt that day). Our gate got changed twice. Ground staff was relaxed and friendly. I got informed of the delays and the cancellation by email and SMS. However the website made it hard to track delays and gate changes. Seats and IFE's (or lack thereof) were as good as it gets for European short hauls. I also found out 3 flight out of 4 had in flight wifi, which is nice. The cheapest plan is 3â‚¬/150kbps for the duration of the flight. Overall a good experience despite the circumstances.",Promoter

" Los Angeles to Munich. The economy seating space is very limited, even the aisles seem narrow for a plane of such size. The flight was delayed, the service was average (no reaction of the staff for a call button for more than 15 minutes), the meals were edible, but nothing special and the portions were rather small. The in-flight entertainment screen reacted poorly on the touches and was slow. There is a wifi connection, very expensive but I didn't use it. No courtesy travel kit was given, only headphones, pillow and a blanket. To be honest, I would expect more.",Detractor

" This flight from Munich to Peking was about as good as flying gets. Loading an almost full A380 with discipline and courtesy is a commendable accomplishment. We were delayed 15 minutes at departure, but we recovered the time in-flight and landed several minutes early. The flight attendant serving our part of the cabin was efficient, proactive, and friendly. The dinner served was elaborate and delicious. The veal and asparagus would have presented a challenge if we had been using plastic cutlery, but silverware did the job handily. I remember feeling that the seat was somewhat narrow in the flat-bed configuration, but I promptly dozed off and slept soundly for five hours. I must have been mistaken about the seat. With all the horror stories about lost luggage published here on Skytrax, I was apprehensive about my suitcase double connecting in Newark and Munich, but Lufthansa (and United) did their job and my case arrived promptly and intact. I had made a special request of Lufthansa by mail ahead of the flight. All correspondence was handled courteously and professionally. Many reviewers here tell bitter tales of frustration dealing with the customer service departments of other airlines, but I could not be more pleased with how LH handled my request. I have read a number of comments questioning whether Lufthansa deserves to be on the Skytrax 5 star list. In my experience and opinion it is a well-deserved honor.",Promoter
" Newark to Munich. This was a fine trip. The A350 is a comfortable aircraft - new, clean, and spacious. The cabin crew were neat and efficient. We were about an hour delayed on departure, but we made up time en route and arrived essentially on-time.

I hurried through the meal and managed to get 4+ hours of quality sleep.",Promoter
" Night departure from Munich to Singapore with Lufthansa. Boarding was efficient and uncomplicated, arrived in cabin. Cabin crew introduced herself to me (bad sign) and kindly forewarned me that as I was in seat 1C, there would be a bassinet in front of me, and offered me a choice of seat change. Eventually was in Seat 7D. The A350-900 version 1 by LH has 2 business class cabins, the one most fore is a self-enclosed area bounded by the toilets and galley in the rear, but this area has bassinet fixing positions. The second area is aft of the toilets and galley and separated by a partition from the premium economy section, this area has less seats but you are more likely to be bothered by toilet and galley noise, if that is important. This area does not have bassinet fixing positions. The modern seat was as efficient and high-tech as before, really simple to adjust your seat to achieve a variety of positions including lie flat. Service was more friendly this time, though also with a Germanic reserve (none the worse for that!). Dinner was served shortly after departure, and was pleasant enough fare. Overall cabin ambience was good enough to achieve a fairly comfortable sleep, and awoke for breakfast - which was really not deserving of the term, it was the first time I ever managed not to eat scrambled eggs and cheese at 40,000 feet! The only other slight criticism is that the toilets were quite heavily used in business class and were showing signs of definite disorder by the time we were approaching our destination. Overall, a comfortable and plush flight in the very quite A350, marred only by a couple of small points.",Promoter
" Booked a pair of European tickets online in March 2018 for Â£428 but Lufthansa recorded the wrong flight times for October, so I changed it 30 minutes later for an extra charge of Â£140 which should not have happened as it was within the first 24 hours of booking. Then when I noticed my partner surname was incorrectly recorded, I was advised by their telephone customer services to cancel and rebook, which I did at an additional cost of Â£400, but again because it was within the first 24 hours, I should have received a full refund (there are still errors recorded in this second booking). After a few weeks I received only Â£241 of the Â£528 in 13 small payments, and still await the balance of Â£328 some 7 weeks of first booking/cancellation. Despite many phone calls to their customer service operators who all promise me the refund within 5 days it does not arrive, but some have insisted all the money had been paid back, or that the total is less than I say it is, yet they are unable to discuss matters further. One even asked me to submit my bank statement to prove that I was underpaid which I emailed to no avail. They refuse to give me contact details of their Ticketing Section, so I am very frustrated. Their online customer services logging system should reply within ""five days"" but my enquiry about the delay and also my follow-up complaint have only been acknowledged but have never been responded to, despite my weekly emailed prompts to them. They complain of repeated queries slowing up their system, but this is their own fault for not dealing more quickly - how much extra money are they spending on their phone services that would have been avoided if customers had been dealt with earlier.",Detractor
" Flew Lufthansa from Amsterdam to Istanbul via Frankfurt. The flight from Amsterdam to Frankfurt went very well. The cabin crew were friendly, the seats were comfortable and the service was good.

The airport is big and the walking distances are quite long for a transfer of 50 minutes. After rushing through the terminal, we made to our connecting flight. This flight to Istanbul went also very well. Except one thing: the meal. The meal was chicken with some vegetables, but it didn't taste very nice. I couldn't eat my meal and I stayed hungry till we arrived in Istanbul. But despite the meal, everything went well. I would like it if Lufthansa offered flights with enough connecting time so we don't need to rush through their big terminal. Also the meal onboard would nice if it's more tasty and not cold and not fresh as the meal onboard the flight from FRA to IST.",Passive
 Flew Lufthansa from Frankfurt to London Heathrow. I had to travel whilst 7 months pregnant and was anxious and apprehensive about the journey. I had done everything I could in advance to make the journey go smoothly such a reserving a suitable aisle seat in advance and paying extra for this. When I boarded the plane my seat was taken with no real explanation and I was told I could not sit there and the Luftansa staff member was unsympathetic towards my need to be in a comfortable aisle seat. It took a long time for a very unsympathetic response to my complaint to come from customer services.

 Kiev to Manchester via Frankfurt. I booked this trip for my mother to celebrate her 79th birthday with me in England. Her flight from Kiev was delayed. Her return flight from Manchester was at 9.20 am which would give me plenty of time to get to the airport. After the ticket purchase the return flight changed to 6.15 am which made me to spend an extra Â£130 to stay at an airport hotel. The flight change in Frankfurt to Kiev was 50 minutes. The plane set off from Manchester 54 minutes late so my mum missed the flight at Frankfurt as she did not have enough time for the flight change. I also booked a wheel chair assistance for her. Nobody collected her from the plane in Frankfurt as it was promised by Lufthansa. It took ages for her to find the gate at Frankfurt to Kiev and it was one of the reasons why she missed flight to Kiev. At Frankfurt she had to wait 12 hours before she was given a seat to Kiev. The gate at Frankfurt to Kiev was changed just before the boarding. She arrived to Kiev 12 hours later than expected and wasted the money for her train ticket from Kiev as she missed it too. The whole journey was a disaster. I will avoid them forever.,Detractor
 Frankfurt to Singapore. Check-In Took place in NUE very quick and efficient. Ground Staff with no smile but not rude or unfriendly. Flight Departure in NUE was 30 minutes late due to weather. Communication by the crew was ok. The flight only was 25 minutes and no service at all. Frankfurt to Singapore is an A380 flight. Boarding was very quick. We had seats in the upper deck Economy cabin. This is compared to the usual Economy Cabin very nice. The seats are 2-4-2. And the cabin is very calm with only 70 Pax or so. There is 1 responsible FA for the cabin. At this flight it was a very gentle and friendly staff who took care of passenger and had a very great attention. The dinner was very delicious and several drink services before and after the food was served. Before our landing in SIN they serve typical Economy breakfast. Since the arrival in SIN is 5pm local time I can't really understand why they not serve just an quick snack instead of a breakfast. The entertainment program of LH is good. A big advantage of the A380 are the camera views of the aircraft. Due to the great FA on this trip we have been really exited about LH.,Promoter

The flight was reasonably smooth with the usual meat/cheese sandwich provided and landing about 20 minutes early. The connection time was about 2 hours but the secure area we were in had very few facilities: a small restaurant, McDonalds and Heinemann Duty Free. On the flight to Shanghai, I was sat on the aisle.

The seats were relatively comfortable and the service was quintessentially German. The flight landed on time.",Passive
" Business class on A321 service from Munich to Madrid. Departure was delayed due to a faulty coffee machine, of all things, but was impressed with the efficient gate change and marginal delay, even after they had to identify an alternative aeroplane. In the end, delayed by about 30 mins. Boarding was free-for-all, given the delay, but still relatively pleasant. Business seating on this flight was exactly the same as economy, except for the fact that the centre seat is left empty with a ""seat-filler"", that allows you to ""share"" the empty seat space with your other seating partner as a table-rest. Legroom also felt pretty much the same as economy. There was no IFE, other than ""pay-for-service"" wifi, if you wished. The differentiation is the food, obviously - as we were served a full breakfast on this 2 hour hop, with the food being even better than the business class breakfast served on the long-haul LH flight. Service was prompt and friendly. Nonetheless, given the price differential, I'm not sure I would part with my own hard-earned cash for business class flights solely for priority boarding and better food.",Promoter

The seats have electronic adjustment of virtually all parameters, including chair softness. AKG noise cancelling headphones, and adjustable IFE screen. Slight criticisms - the pockets for placing items were not very large, for example, difficult to fit in an iPad, and not many clever storage crannies. Service throughout was efficient but lacking the warmth and friendliness of Asian airlines. Food for dinner was served on departure and the menu looked good.

" Munich to Palma. Fully satisfied. Don't understand why people complain about the normal seats on Lufthansa's short range flights - this is standard among virtually all_European airlines. We were travelling with our daughter of 2 years on a vacation trip. The benefits were obvious, especially when travelling with a little, impatient child - you'll learn to love the fast lane, the lounge (even though the one in PMI is quite disappointing, but it is run by the airport itself and used for every airline), and the priority luggage service (which I never noticed on business trips, as I only had carry-on luggage). We loved the quiet atmosphere in the well booked business class compartment - our daughter had two seats on her own to take a nap almost throughout the entire flight. Service and food onboard were professional and friendly. The surcharge when booking a non flexible business class ticket compared to the available economy tickets was well worth the benefits. Will definitely book Lufthansa BC again next year.",Promoter

There are airlines with better meals in economy but also others with meals which are not as good as the meals with Lufthansa. The Seats we had, 96k and 96h on the upper deck were worth the money as it was pretty quiet and the service offered by the crew was great. The most dissapointing thing was the inflight entertainment system which seems to be a bit old and slow. Also the selection of music and films compared to other airlines was not very good. It was enough to survive the 12 hours flight but not as good as expected. Overall I would choose Lufthansa again.",Passive

I also requested services from the staff and the person assigned to the area pretended not to see or hear the passengers' calls. When I was getting my return flight from Buenos Aires to Tokyo, the flight was canceled and rescheduled, we had to wait around seven hours. Someone from Lufthansa staff in Buenos Aires did not want to inform us about the arrival times to our destination. I was assigned a second flight from Frankfurt to Tokyo with only one hour difference, I was not informed that I would travel with another airline and they did not confirm whether I would be given seats with a crib for my baby (I had paid for this seat as flying from Buenos Aires to Tokyo can easily take more than 30 hours). I asked the staff to confirm this information, but she told me that everything was indicated on the ticket, which was not the case since it did not indicate the local time of arrival to Tokyo, so I had to request the information from another staff. Finally, the flight took off later than the scheduled time expected so I was afraid that I could not connect flights on time. In Frankfurt, you can experience some delay while making flight connections.

" I had heard good things about Lufthansa's business class and selected them for this flight from Bangkok to Frankfurt. I regret the decision. The worst feature is the extremely narrow seat. I'm not large but found it to be a tight fit around the shoulders. Also, the seat is on a sideways angle, meaning that it's not a natural position in which to sleep in the bed mode, further complicated by the fact that the footwell is very narrow indeed. This is a 2-2-2 configuration and the seats are far too close to each other and lack any real sense of privacy (nor do they have a privacy screen). I do the same sector frequently and this is by far the worst of the major airlines. The cabin looks great but in practical terms (ie the need to sleep), it is very poor. I only wanted a snack for dinner on a midnight departure and chose a Thai prawn appetiser (dry and miserable) and some cheese (dreary but edible) With so many other great business class choices available, it's extremely unlikely I would choose Lufthansa again.",Detractor
" Rio de Janeiro to London via Frankfurt. The flight was good, the onboard service was good but at the time I've landed in my destination, when I got my suitcase it was broken even with a FRAGILE sticker. The holder was bending over and when I was try to fix it to can carry the luggage it couldn't be fixed. I've had a big trouble to bring it to home. I've emailed Lufthansa asking for a repair day after and I hadn't have an answer. They choose to ignore my email and I still got a broken suitcase and I'm still waiting for a repair.",Passive

" New York to Berlin in business class. Flights were fine. Security at JFK T1 is always disorganized, with pre check sometimes available and often not. This time, there was a dedicated lane, I got to pass with shoes on, but, at x ray, the officer suddenly insisted â€œthere is no precheckâ€ and sent my bag to be prodded, examined and swabbed. LH owns a quarter of T1 and so would seem to have a at least a quarter of the responsibility to sort out the chronic security mess. The lounge was overcrowded and under catered, worn and unchanged. Pre flight dining is now a standard expectation for C class transatlantic flights, but here for a 10.30 pm departure, the offer is a bowl of canned vegetables, sadly wilting on a steam table, next to Teriyaki chicken. There are also some chicken wraps, just about edible. The wines are basic. Pre flight at TXL is even worse. Mobile boarding passes must be exchanged for paper at the desk - no obvious reason",Passive
 Frankfurt to Seattle. Checkin is OK. Space for Business class is below average and not meeting the price. Friendly staff. Lounge had no soft drinks due to technical problem and staff not willing to organize other soft drinks. Customer Service does not react via E-Mail.,Detractor

First time after 10 years flying with Lufthansa, and probably arrived the time to say good by to this airline.",Detractor
" The flight from Madrid to Frankfurt was quite good, but it was a regret buying a Business Class ticket for this short haul flight.

" Plane was 40 minutes late from Gothenburg due to weather situation. But then they landed at an 'outside' position at terminal C, and brought you by bus to terminal B (where no Lufthansa flights leave), arriving at the terminal 1 hour late. Then you had to run to Terminal A (walkway did not work) to arrive just/in-time completely exhausted at the Gate to go back with the last bus to the next outside position.

" Flight DÃ¼sseldorf - Los Angeles via London Heathrow booked on Lufthansa website. About one hour before scheduled flight to LHR we had been informed about flight cancellation. This was just the begin of our horror trip .We spent almost six hours at DUS airport trying to rebook our flight. Customer service desk at the airport was rude and unwilling to help, so we had to rebook our flight to LAX on our own, via the Lufthansa call-centre. Unfortunately the first available flight was on the next day from FRA. Few words to the flight itself. I know flying economy class you can not expect too much. But the seat comfort and entertainment on Lufthansa A380 is in my opinion below average. Seats comparing to other airlines (KLM and Aeromexico) felt very cramped and uncomfortable and touchscreens unresponsive. The only positive aspect of the flight was the flight crew, which was very attentive. After coming back from our trip in September we claimed for compensation from Lufthansa for our cancelled flight and almost 30 hours delayed arrival in Los Angeles. Unfortunately no respose till today (February 18th 2018).",Detractor
" First experience of the Lufthansa Premium Economy on a flight from Houston to Frankfurt. The seats are a significant upgrade over Economy seats. They are slightly wider, have more legroom and more generous recline. Furthermore, each seat has a power socket. The service was basically an economy service with some enhancements (juice as welcome drink, food was served on china plates, but is the same food as in Economy). The flight attendants were professional as usual on Lufthansa, but the service was nothing exceptional. The food was ok: the pasta was overcooked and slightly tasteless, but I have had much worse in Economy. Breakfast was better than expected. If the price is right, I will fly Premium Economy with Lufthansa again.",Passive
" Whilst I am very proud that Lufthansa has become the first European airline to be awarded 5 Stars and they got it so right with the logo redesign, it is unfortunately also still true that the situation at its main hub, Frankfurt, leaves a lot to be desired for. Traveling every week on the same route (to and from Milan) from Frankfurt, the chances of boarding a departing flight via a finger directly from the terminal are 50/50. Sometimes buses depart from gates in the newly added terminal A part that require a good 10 mins walk to get there. Arriving into Frankfurt almost always means an apron position somewhere on the tarmac and easily a 10 mins bus drive. So, for instance landing on the relatively new runway West, taxiing can take 10 mins to the parking position, sometimes adding waiting time for buses to arrive and 10 mins to get to the terminal? That adds up to almost 50% of the flying time from Milan! Crazy. Frankfurt airport uses retired, cramped buses from local public transport bus companies. Then arriving bus passengers get cattled via a narrow staircase into the terminal, where on some lucky days there are two airport employees with iPads helping with gate information but generally being overwhelmed by the number of passengers asking for information. Sometimes connecting passengers are left to their own devices at this badly signposted airport with only a few areas where screens would provide up-to-date gate information. But the worst part is how Lufthansa and Frankfurt airport are providing for premium travelers (with the exception of HONs and First Class passengers). Long waiting times at security and in the Schengen Area in Terminal A there are a total of 3 lounges that, at peak times, are more than overcrowded. Schengen departures in Terminal B have no lounge access whatsoever. Guests in the three lounges (2 business, one Senator/Star Alliance Gold) can stand for an hour and are being catered for by a disappointing offer of food. All this leaves regular Lufthansa clients guessing why the airline gets it so right with their second hub Munich (2 Business lounges and a total of 4 Senator lounges/areas). In their London, Munich and hopefully soon Malpensa lounge, Lufthansa also provides a much more sophisticated food offer compared to its main hub, Frankfurt. So what is it, that is the cause of this difference? Maybe all Lufthansa management responsible for travel experience should be paired up with a passenger and follow their real travel experience for the duration of their Frankfurt airport stay to help realize, how sub-optimal the whole set-up really is.",Promoter
" Munich to Madrid. It seems like the check in for Economy passers has to be done from then on their own, same goes with the bag drop. That's a little inconvenient especially if you're having several connecting flight and want to check if you can get the bag for a layover. The boarding was almost one hour delayed but LH kept everyone informed and once it started it was very quick. The flight itself was good.",Promoter
" Munich to San Francisco in First Class. Fantastic service from start to finish. The new lounge in Munich is a huge improvement, spacious and with great apron views. Excellent crew, attentive and professional. The seat and cabin are very comfortable, although i prefer row 2 as there quite a lot of toilet/gallery traffic in the 1st row. On time landing, and through immigration and luggage collected within 20 minutes of landing. Only negative is the boarding procedure in Munich. No real priority boarding for First - just the general Business/Star Gold friend and family boarding scrum. A shame Munich can't offer the same incredible ground services as in Frankfurt.",Promoter
" Flew London Heathrow to Frankfurt with Lufthansa. Probably the smoothest flight I've had! A minor delay, 12 minutes or so, but well announced. Seating was comfortable and cabin crew were excellent.

" Frankfurt to Madrid. Great European flights from Frankfurt to Madrid on both legs. Lufthansa serves a free hot meal on this 2.5 hour flight which is very outstanding in times of pay for anything. Meals were delicious and came with full bar service. Crew was great and very helpful. Both flights were smooth and on time. Only annoying aspect was boarding and deboarding in Frankfurt with long bus rides, but I guess this is the fault of Frankfurt airport (lack of gate positions).",Promoter
" My flight from Toulouse to New York with Lufthansa was very enjoyable. Everywhere, ground agents were very nice and there were no delays along the way. On the first leg, the seat was comfortable. It was less so on the flight from Frankfurt to New-York, where economy seats are a bit cramped (I am tall), but very manageable. Flight attendants were nice. The food was good, although I have had better before. The inflight entertainment was good, although the range of movies and shows proposed was a bit limited compared to new high quality entertainment standards. Once in NYC, I got my bag quickly. Overall, the flight was nice, for an affordable price. I will enjoy flying with them again sometime.",Promoter
" Flew Delhi to Toronto via Frankfurt. Pleasant Experience. I flew LH 761 on mighty 380 plane with smoothest take off and landing. In these days 380 is the only plane left with wide and comfortable seats. Staff were tentative and courteous and special food requests were also accommodated. Transfer at FRA was OK and next flight was also good. Probably, Lufthansa is in the handful of good airlines remaining in sky in spite of strong competition of Big M3.",Promoter
" Toulouse to Singapore via Frankfurt. The TLS-FRA flight arrived late, leading to miss the connecting flight to SIN and causing me to spend the night in FRA. These things happen, and as a frequent traveler working in the aerospace industry, I'm more understanding than most. However, I was not impressed at all by the way the situation was handled: no information was given by the crew about the delay of the TLS-FRA leg. We were just stuck in the aircraft, doors closed, and not moving. After asking multiple times, I was told by the FA it was because of fog in FRA. When I proceeded to claim compensation, the airline told me it was because of French Air Traffic Control Strike. Remembering the chaos in FRA airport that evening, I have a hard time believing that. No staff was available to provide assistance once arrived in FRA airport. All customer service desks were closed, even though it was obvious that there was a big mess in FRA. It was impossible to reach the hotline to check for alternative flights. I stayed online for 2 times 45 mns, before giving up. So I organized my own hotel, transportation and meals, and in line with EU regulation 261/2004, I asked the airline to pay for the expense incurred. It has now been 4 months, and I have yet to receive the funds. I received a reply 6 weeks ago telling me the payment has been made, but it never reached my bank account. Now, customer relations department is just playing dead. On the onboard experience itself, I would say that the crew is professional, but rather cold. Food is edible, but I thought below average of other full service airlines. The major issue lies with FRA airport, where connections are very long: I had to walk 35 mns and take a train to reach the other terminal. Security was very long, with only 2 lines open, and rude staff at every checkpoint (passport control, security, boarding gates). Considering the ticket price, I will not fly with them again, mostly because of FRA airport, and the ""ghost"" customer relations department. I cannot believe they received a 5 star rating.",Detractor
" Munich to Athens. The points I mention donÂ´t mean much, but in combination they make you wonder why you spent more than the price of an economy class ticket. Outbound flight MUC-ATH (Jan.13th, 2018): I noticed that the Business Class security fast lane at MUC airport was not open. The food in the business lounge at MUC is fine but the same. When boarding the aircraft you used to be addressed by name, not for me. The A321 business cabins have a fixed tray table across the middle seat which is very awkward for sitting down and getting up when you have a window seat. An economy class passenger stowed his hand luggage in the business class overhead compartment. No welcome drink, and announcements in German and English, no Greek. The onboard choice of meals consisted of two main courses, the one I chose I found inedible. LH always serves freshly baked bread which is nice but for some reason they forgot me so I had to ask for it. After meal, economy class passengers queued to use the business class toilet. Return flight ATH-MUC the lounge at ATH airport nice with better food than MUC but no toilets. Staff took the trouble to annouce LH departures personally which was a nice touch. At gate, priority boarding was announced but not enforced. This is one of the most annoying problems with LH business class travel and it happens all the time. On the flight, again no announcements in Greek, food markedly better, but disorganised service. They didnÂ´t come around to ask if you wanted any extra drinks after meal service, and some tray tables stayed down into final approach at MUC. All in all, not a five-star experience.",Detractor

 London to Osaka via Frankfurt. I received an extremely unpleasant experience. Not a single flight departed on time causing severe delays during my journey. Worst in-flight meal service I have seen.

" London to Moscow via Frankfurt. Flying from London to Frankfurt was reasonable though we were very irritated that our seats had been changed. The cabin crew were pleasant. Transiting in Frankfurt was very efficient, with a representative meeting us on the exit of the aircraft and took us to our gate. The queues there were long with first a document check and then general boarding. Not only were we delayed by over 40 minutes but our seats were changed again from row 6 to row 33. To say we were irritated would be an understatement. The flight was extremely full and there was barely space to put our hand luggage. We felt sympathy for the cabin crew as they were clearly exhausted, having to work on Christmas Eve on an evening flight. On our return flight, check-in was super quick but boarding was quite chaotic though relatively speedy in the end. We again had our seats changed but it was to the emergency exit row. We transited at MUC before continuing on to LHR. Nothing pretty remarkable for such a short flight. Overall, Lufthansa do well in terms of seat comfort but the food is quite repetitive. However, they are to be commended for being one of the few airlines to maintain a complimentary onboard service in economy.In addition, whilst the cabin crew are satisfactory, they lack the some hospitality and come across coldly.",Passive
" Manchester to Los Angeles via Munich. Smooth transit through Manchester airport and comfortable lounge - very friendly staff which helped. Short haul flight comfortable with a continental breakfast served, FAs attentive and a pillow given as we slumbered on the way (6am flight). In Munich, straight into terminal building and next flight only a few gates away. Again lounge comfortable and functional - not a huge selection to eat. Next flight 12 hours to LAX, Onboard dining was really good and tasty, a plus there. Seats okay - 2x2x2 in a row with FA reaching over to window seat to serve meals and seat narrows off in foot end, so doesn't feel particularly spacious. Nice to lie fully flat on a long journey, would not say the seat is greatly comfortable for sleep, if anything a bit hard.

" As a German I used Lufthansa quite regularly and during the last few years I was never happy with the value for money of my home carrier. That started to change from 2016 and now I have had another great experience with LH. Flown Hannover - Frankfurt - Miami and back Atlanta - Frankfurt in premium economy class. Short flight HAJ to FRA as usual, in time, small snack, nothing special, but its just 40 mins in the air. FRA-MIA on A380 premium economy. Thats very good value for money. Seats are spacious to all sides, IFE monitor is bigger. Cabin is seperated from economy class. Food is economy class food but served on porcelain. They serve two meals on that flights, both of them have beem surprisingly good. Beverage selection and IFE have been good as well. Staff helpful, friendly and professional. Flight was on time. On the way back from Atlanta it was an A340, cabin was not clearly seperate from eco class, but seats and food have the same comfort as on the A380. Flight was also on time. The only negative thing was that both flights have been heavily overbooked. On the way to US they announce at the gate that every business class traveller which would downgrade to premium economy would get 800 Euro. So far so good, but actually the rate difference was 900 Euro per way (at least what I got offered). On the way back they offered all passengers at check in which volunteer to fly next day 800 USD. However especially on US flights I see that happens regularly, so no big deal as long as they find volunteers.",Promoter

There is a Lufthansa Business class check-in counter inside ""long distance trains"" station at FRA airport. What a great idea! 10 meters after leaving the train from Munich, we instantly dropped our luggage. However we had no friendly welcome at all at counter, neither information about lounge, gate whatsoever. Next passenger please! Neither a smiley welcome at gate, except from a Japanese attendant. Also boarding was slow and lacking information about slight delay. It seems that LH has improved the quality of inflight service but, on the ground, passengers, in any class, always seem to bother attendants. Something has to be done as we faced a similar situation in GIG. Fortunately on board (upper deck), a fabulous moment. Fabulous crew, great food and drinks (except cheap Champagne).

" Toronto to Manchester via Frankfurt. The transfer at Frankfurt was terrible, having to change terminals, use a train and go through security again so contacted the customer service and asked for my return flight if I could have an earlier flight from Manchester to Frankfurt. This would involve a 3am start and I would have to pay for a hotel. Was told that this couldn't be done but if I turned up for the flight and checked in the change could be made at check-in. Turned up at 04:00 to be told this isn't possible and I have to phone Lufthansa. Made the call and after an hour and 300 EUR I had the earlier flight. Arrived at Frankfurt and began the delays, 2 hours at the gate, then 4 hours sat on the plane as the de-icer was needed, then it was needed again. So arrived after a 23 hour day still to ensure a 4 hour drive home. So, sent an e-mail and letter to Lufthansa giving them my feedback from my first trip with them, the bad customer service and the great cabin crew. Received a call from the customer service team (located in Manila) with an apology and an offer of 600 EUR compensation. Agreed this and felt that Lufthansa had actually listened to me. 2 hours later receive a call to tell me a mistake has been made and the compensation is only 300 EUR - sorry I say, you made an offer which was accepted and I'm not accepting you changing your mind. They told me they would speak to a manager and call me back. Received an e-mail 20 minutes later to tell me my 'request' for compensation had been rejected and a cheque had been issued for the lower amount. So I called the team and over the next four days received a long line of contradictions - 'The manager will speak to you now, the manager went home whilst you were waiting, we will only talk to a lawyer, we cannot let you speak to a member of Lufthansa, we are a call agency'.

" Paris to Tbilisi via Munich. Excellent flights and outstanding services on both flights. The first part of journey is a short flight from Paris to Munich. The cabin crew was very attentive, there was very clean aircraft and very tasty snack (some kind of sweet cake). The flight from Munich to Tbilisi is about 3 hours and 20 minutes. The flight attendants were very prompt and professional. The food was perfectly prepared and was one of the best economy three course meal. We had two hot choices - chicken and pasta. The bar service was very good offering drinks three times during dinner. Lufthansa is really the best European airline and I recommend them for the route to Georgia.",Promoter
" The check in process was easy and fast. At Washington Dulles Airport it is easy to navigate and find your gate. The boarding was well organized (30 mins with full load factor). Our plane was a reconstructed B747-400 thus the cabin was clean and nice, the seats were really comfortable. The legroom is perfect for a 7 hours 30 mins flight. The catering was fast, large selection of drinks (alcoholic, non alcoholic) and food was offered in Economy Class. The inflight entertainment system includes eternal opportunities to be entertained: movies, cartoons, documentaries, music, games and live tv. The flight was smooth. Our connection time in Frankfurt was enough to catch our plane to Budapest. The level of the service on this short-haul flight was excellent as always. I would say that Lufthansa is the best option on a transatlantic route.",Promoter
" New York to Berlin. The boarding was simple, yet late. The small Lufthansa lounge at New York's JFK Terminal 1 was very empty, the selection average, a mixture of cold and hot food and drinks. 10 min late, the boarding commenced. First to enter the plane are business and first class passengers. Greeted by a very lovely flight attendeant, I got served an orange juice. Soon after takeoff, I got nuts and another cold drink. The selection on the menu was as expected for a 7 hour flight: one main meal and 1.5 hours before arrival, a small breakfast. The vegetarian option was excellent, the pasta cooked well. After the food service, the lights were dimmed. I tried my seat functions, pretty standard seat for business class. Yet I was happy about the lie flat seat. The entertainment system worked well, the selection of movies was quite impressive! The only downside to the entertainment options I found was WiFi connectivity. It did not connect for 2/3 devices of mine. Also, the price of WiFi is very high considering I flew in Business class. Some airlines offer this service for free. After a long sleep, a flight attended woke me up and asked to serve me breakfast. This was a much more simple meal, all on one tray. Then I arrived in Berlin. The aircraft was parked at a stand so the deboarding process took longer than at a gate, having to fill the busses with passengers. Overall, a very good experience!",Promoter
" Bangkok to Frankfurt, delayed by 3 hours, no proactive communication. Just an information received last minute with wrong information about boarding time. Boarding was a mess. Finally I got into the plane and the entertainment system did not work. Not good this time.",Detractor

" Rome to Munich. It was phenomenal. It's probably been about 20 years since I last flew Lufthansa and it is still as efficient and good as I remember. Prior to boarding, LH sends out a link where you can download magazines for your flight. Even though there was no in-flight entertainment such as movies, this was an innovative way of rectifying this issue. Business class in Europe, apart from Turkish, is generally done with economy seating and the middle one kept free. That is pretty much the standard. This A321 was the newer generation with the new sharklets (winglets) and looked brand new, the seats were good but no better than in Economy. The service was excellent. even though the flight was relatively short, just over an hour, we were served smoked salmon, some meat and a dessert which were all delicious. On US carriers you would be hard pressed to get such a good meal on a transcontinental flight in First Class.",Promoter
" Denver to Tel Aviv via Frankfurt, The worst part was the food, but the meals were inedible. The seats were very uncomfortable, new slimline designs which mean less cushion and thin armrests. The airline only allows one checked bag from the US, even on international flights if flying in economy - the economy plus averages about $300 more, so certainly not affordable for most travelers, but if you can afford it, it's 100% worth it for the bigger seats, screens, and extra checked bag. The wifi never worked for me on board my flights. The only positives were the flight attendants were really nice and they did have free alcohol (as all international flights should) so that helped me get through an otherwise awful experience.",Detractor
" Frankfurt to Bangkok. I was very much impressed and pleased with their service. The seats in the A380 are very comfortable, given that it is an economy class seat. The service was good and attentive. The food was good. And, after all, the price was good as well. So, what can I say, I guess I will fly Lufthansa again. Hopefully I am similarly pleased.",Promoter
" Budapest to Venice via Munich. The first flight from Budapest departed with 20-30 mins of delay. This is ok as delays can occur and the duration was rather short. However, arrival in Munich was also delayed in turn by 20-30 mins. The connection in Munich was known in advance to be short, for which reason it is expected that the airline has foreseen how to manage this flight combination. Instead this connection was managed very poorly. Arrival in Munich airport took place at the gate area K, while the connecting flight (to Venice) was at gate area G. This, according to the screen indication itself, requires 17 mins of transfer time. Upon arrival, I noticed on the screen that the connecting flight was already boarding. After taking the shuttle train (needed for this transfer) and running the rest of the way, I arrived at the gate only to discover that the flight was gone. It seems nobody bothered to advise that there was somebody on the way, and hopefully the plane could wait for a mere 10 mins. Offering a connection implies that it is reasonably managed. In spite of the short connection in this case, it seems the airline makes it even worse by setting flights at different areas and not advising of people in transfer. I would never ask a plane with all passengers to wait for a long time, but I do not believe 10 mins would be an issue for anyone. After the above experience, I went to the service desk for help, where I was told that there is ""fortunately another flight tonight"". That meant at 22:00 vs. the original 15:30 that I missed. To illustrate the staff's further lack of customer service, I was told I am eligible for a voucher since I will spend a long time at the airport. I was given a voucher for 10 euros. After indicating that a 10-euro voucher does not seem exactly a correct response from the airline for the trouble caused, I was told that maybe it was a system error, and after a second check, the staff confirmed that in fact I am eligible for 17 euro. I did not continue the discussion as it would have been a waste of time. The above service gives me an impression that the airline simply does not care. In fact it feels like a joke. In any case, I would have expected a much different treatment for a company with a German origin and reputation. Obviously for the future I will avoid this specific flight connection, but I will also avoid Lufthansa connections in general as well.",Detractor
" Again I had to fly with Lufthansa from Berlin Tegel to Frankfurt. And again, as often the case, plane was late because of late arrival - or because they changed the aircraft to a larger one. The 30 min delay was - as always - communicated only at the gate. Seat changed from the first row in economy to somewhere in the back. I am happy to fly with other airlines next week.",Detractor
" Lufthansa have a good short haul product. The cabin staff on this flight were excellent and professional. The level of service was also good right from check, onboard and disembarking.

 Frankfurt to Nice. Cabin looked modern and clean and the aircraft was quite new as well (A320neo). The price was average but the service Lufthansa provides on domestic/european flights is something you cannot take for granted these days. I was surprised they still supplied free drinks and a snack which shows they still value the customers comfort. Flight attendants were friendly and well trained. Only the Self-Service Check-in at Frankfurt Airport might be a bit inconvenient but Lufthansa staff were eager to help. Overall a good experience,Promoter

" Berlin to Frankfurt. The Boeing 747 is my favourite aircraft and Lufthansa flew that on this route. One thing I had to complain about (I guess that is more a Berlin TXL problem than LH) is that there were no open check-in counter in Terminal C where this flight departed. I guess it was because usually LH departs Terminal A but there was no space for the 747. There might have been a problem for people with checked-in luggage or people who wanted to check in at the airport. The flight itself was the best I have had so far. The crew was very friendly, the entertainment program was good and they gave everyone a chocolate teddy after landing. The space between seats was good, I'm 1.67m and I could stretch my legs - I guess there were 10-15cm to the seat in front of me. All in all a very pleasant flight.",Promoter
" Mumbai to Frankfurt return. Ground staff at Mumbai and Frankfurt were cheerful and committed to a better Service. Check-in at Mumbai was pretty quick. The cabin crew was great. The seat was slightly narrow though. The leg room was very limited as well. My IFE wasn't working, and it wasn't fixed even after being promised. I had a similar experience with IFE on my previous Lufthansa flight. Food was sumptuous but ordinary. All these negative aspects got covered up for by the highly trained pilots and staff. The take-off and landing were very smooth. The aircraft was very well maintained. The cabin was very quiet as well.",Passive
"  In generally terms, we had good experiences, during the trip Panama to Frankfurt return. We have to congratulate one staff who was the flight customer service most friendly in the world, specially with my mother who needed a wheel chair arriving Frankfurt from London on Saturday 11 of November. He took us as if we were his family (we were 6 people) and guided us wonderfully through this huge Frankfurt Airport to the Hilton Garden Hotel. However at the following morning (Sunday 12, November) despite we asked for similar service (a wheelchair), Lufthansa failed totally. We waited about 45 minutes in the Hotel reception, to received a laconic communication from the airline explaining that was ""system failure"" and did not book the service. On the other hand, Lufthansa services and his workers in the airport are in a bad mood. Returning to Panama was an odyssey trying to get information about the process of check-in. And we had to weigh our luggage and put the tags ourselves? And the boarding gate place B62 is awful it looks like a 19th century factory.",Passive

Flight back who was supposed to leave 7:15 has not yet started boarding at 7:30 - while they still keep saying it's late 20 min. Operations and info policy is very weak, also no coffee, no newspapers, nothing at the gate. And it's probably getting worser and higher prices since they do not have competition anymore. Definitely not premium!",Detractor
"  Lufthansa promised me a full refund last month. I haven't got a cent back, and judging by the comments on their facebook page, I might have to wait a year, or forever! 2 days after buying my ticket, Lufthansa changed the flights: turning a 1 hour layover into over 5 hours. I bought the ticket at a premium to avoid very early departures and very late arrivals. Lufthansa could no longer deliver that and after over 30 minutes on the phone (costing over 10 euros), I accepted to get a full refund. That was October 6th. I have not got a cent back. I fly between Oslo and Malta at least 5 times a year with this airline. This rescheduling of flights happened to me many times before, but it is the first time that I had to accept a full refund (I still haven't got it, despite contacting the airline several times). Needless to say, my 5+ return tickets per year will be bought with another airline from now on. LH is HL: HopeLess.",Detractor

  Dresden to London Heathrow via Munich. Credit where credit is due. Flights all delayed due to terrible weather yet Lufthansa did a fantastic job getting me to my connection with an individual taxi style transfer from plane to plane at Munich allowing me to make a meeting in London.

Would highly recommend transiting through Lufthansa hubs (both Munich and Frankfurt).,Promoter
"  Short flight from Brussels to Munich. Boarding was orderly and the flight was full with most people seeming to prefer carry-on as opposed to check luggage, the reason would become clear once we landed. The LH flights to and from Brussels use the T2 annex which means that collecting your bags takes ages in this case 45 min after the plane landed! The flight itself was good with a sandwich and drinks service. Sear 10C has plenty of legroom and the neo are very quiet. Flight left a few minutes later but made up time and landed as scheduled.",Passive
"  Munich to Geneva. Flew this for a short break between business trips. Small cozy aircraft - I always liked a bombardier. Small snack given, quite OK for the short trip. No inflight entertainment system but quite OK for a short trip. The flight attendants were helpful and friendly. The seats were comfortable and even though I had a seat empty next to me, having someone next to me would not affect the space that much. The only downside is for the next flight (which was not on star alliance) I was not able to check in my luggage through and thus had to exit the transit area and collect my luggage to check it in again. Ground staff was clear when they informed this to me.",Promoter
  I am a regular Lufthansa customer and fly over 300.000 miles a year. LH is usually a good and reliable airline. One of my biggest complaint is the flow of economy passengers using the front lavatories. On my last flight from Lisbon to Frankfurt there were 6 people queuing up in the aisle waiting for the lavatory making it almost impossible for business pax to use the lavatories. This for some reason is standard procedure on LH. Another problem I have with them is that the crew uses the overhead bins for their own luggage leaving practically no room for their so called â€˜priority customers' which are seated on rows 1&2. Food quality and quantity is also on the decline. If flying in Europe I try to avoid them and prefer LX and OS which are both owned by LH but have much higher standards.,Passive
"  Cluj to Delhi via Munich. The first leg was operated by Air Dolomiti for Lufthansa, only a muffin for breakfast. The second leg was Lufthansa, lousy food and poor choice of beverages.

We barely made it there and I was having a meltdown. As anyone who has ever been in Munich airport will agree, it is not the easiest to navigate though. The only time Air Dolomiti said anything was before they landed apologizing for the ""delay"". Once again, no explanation. We are done with Lufthansa.",Detractor
"  London to Dresden via Frankfurt. First time with Lufthansa, short queue checking in at Heathrow so good start, but soon after entering the airport flight information was showing a 25 minute delay. Eventually boarded plane and flight took off around 1 hour late, problems with crew apparently. During the flight we were told that they had no information about connecting flights and should check the flight boards in the airport. But as soon as we landed and I switched on my phone I had an email stating that I was booked on the later 22:05 flight to Dresden. Facing a 4 hour wait at the airport I went to the very busy Lufthansa service desk where I asked if I could use their airport lounge. As I was only an economy customer and not a Lufthansa member the answer was no. I was given a 10 euro voucher and a copy of my rights as a passenger.",Detractor
"  Newark-Liberty Intl to Munich, LH0413, 18 Sept 2017. I did not expect something elegant or sophisticated from Lufthansa, but their service was appalling. The flight was delayed due to ""late arrival of the plane"". Quite worn out plane, not much of a welcome on board, dim light in the cabin did not make me feel bad in the beginning but definitely was not comforting. I do not mind not smiling FA's if the level of service is high. On this flight, I learned for the first time what means lousy service in business class, definitely not expected from 4-star airline. Frugal menu had one appetizer (salad) with no other choices. I chose fish for the main course which was greasy, overly salty and poorly presented. Everything came on the same tray. During the meal, no drink refills were offered (I had regular coke), so I had to ask for a favor. After I asked for the tray to be taken away, FA took it and asked me to throw the tablecloth and serviette on top of the tray. I expected a dessert would have been offered but was wrong. So again I had to ask for one. Not happy with my request, FA asked what I wanted and finally brought a portion of fruits which was placed on the table without any preparation. After such ""feast"" I tried to sleep but the seat was (though full flat) bumpy and extremely narrow even for me (I am a slim person). So the only comfortable position was lying on my side. Finally, I was able to fall asleep but was awaken soon by the noise from the galley where FAs were loudly talking without lowering their voices. About 1 hour before landing I asked for breakfast. It was not served right away, so the seatbelt sign came on. FA told me that now the breakfast could not be served. No single positive emotion during the whole flight. Extremely lousy service is only memorable thing about Lufthansa. My flight back with United (Polaris business class) was a pleasant surprise â€“ frankly, I expected the opposite for these two carriers. Lesson learned: Lufthansa's business is an awkward decoration of a comfort+ class with a flatbed (though very uncomfortable). Given the price for the ticket (almost 9 thousand US $), I will choose Lufthansa only if there is absolutely no alternative.",Detractor
"  Amsterdam to Addis Ababa via Frankfurt. The onboard service is above average and the legroom is good. However, I had booked to leave on August 25th. On arrival at Schiphol the flight was canceled. Overbooking on another flight was not possible, everything was full. Other flights to Frankfurt departed that evening. Also on Saturdays there was only place on flights with at least three stops and a journey time which was twice as long as planned. Then only one flight took 2 days (!) Later, which cost me 2 days. Cancellation can happen and the fact that there were no good alternatives was not to blame Lufthansa. Where I can admit that Lufthansa does not wish to pay my claim. They indicate that the flight was canceled by the weather conditions. That's strange if you take into account that this was the only flight that was canceled that night, KLM just left Frankfurt. One could easily leave with a delay of an hour or so. Now, in addition to the lack of working hours, I have to make expenses to get what I am entitled to. So service on board 8.5, handling complaints a 2 - the staff is friendly, average 4.2 so. DUTCH: De service aan boord is bovengemiddeld en de beenruimte is goed. Echter ik had geboekt om op 25 augustus te vertrekken. Bij aankomst op schiphol was de vlucht geannuleerd. Overboeken op een andere vlucht was niet mogelijk, alles zat vol. Andere vluchten naar Frankfurt vertrokken wel die avond. Ook op zaterdag was er enkel plaats op vluchten met minimaal drie stops en een reisduur welke twee keer zo lang was als gepland. Toen maar een vlucht 2 dagen(!) later genomen wat mij 2 dagen werktijd kostte ter plekke. Annuleren kan gebeuren en ook het feit dat men geen goede alternatieven had is Lufthansa niet te verwijten. Waar ik mij wel aan kan ergeren dat Lufthansa niet mijn claim wenst te betalen. Zij geven aan dat de vlucht geannuleerd was door de weercondities. Dat is vreemd als je in ogenschouw neemt dat dit de enigste vlucht was die geannuleerd werd die avond,KLM vertrok gewoon wel naar Frankfurt. Men had dus makkelijk met een vertraging van een uur of zo kunnen vertrekken. Nu moet ik dus naast het gemis van werkuren onkosten maken om te krijgen waar ik recht op heb. Dus service aan boord 8.5 afhandeling klachten een 2 ( de medewerksters is wel vriendelijk), gemiddeld 4.2 dus.",Detractor
"  Athens to Vancouver via Munich. Despite the comfortable seat and good inflight entertainment in premium economy from Munich to Vancouver, our experience was frustrating, flat out disappointing. We could not check in one of 4 travelers online under one booking. Error messages such as unfortunately you are unable to check in online, your name, ticket number etc may be incorrect, and your routing does not match your ticket. Error messages were different every time we tried so you didn't know what exactly was the reason. We were questioning whether he even had a ticket. Called customer service multiple times only for them to tell us to call tech support which was not open 24/7. We had to wait. Tech support advised that passenger was selected randomly to manually check in at the airport. Had that message shown at online check in, it would have avoided some undue stress and costly int'l roaming charges for calls. Original gate from ATH-MUN was rather close to our MUN-YVR, however we needed all the time we could get to go through exit customs since my mother in law is unable to run. On arrival, the gate of the current flight had changed, and it could not have been father away from our connecting fight. Boarding an A330 MUN-YVR was a disaster. Other than frequent flyers/business class boarding first, it was general boarding for everyone all at once and this included wheelchair passengers. If you're a seasoned traveler, you know boarding in an orderly fashion from the back of the aircraft to the front helps prevent backlogs. Passengers were backlogged on the jet bridge so that it piled up back to a short escalator that was available to passengers and their carry ons which most, if not all, used it. Safety issue here is that it bunched up people all the way to the bottom of the escalator where those getting off had no place to go. Upon arrival into YVR, we were advised our checked baggage did not make the connection in MUN and advised they will deliver our bags the following evening. They were not delivered as promised the following evening and delivered another 12 hours later the following morning. Total 40hrs. We wrote an email to customer relations right after the online check in fiasco and the email did warrant a response from Lufthansa. It has been 7 days and still no response. ",Detractor
"  Belgrade to Brussels via Frankfurt. First time flying with Lufthansa and was not disappointed. Both flights were pleasant, cabin crew was very friendly, food was minimal but still tasty. Seats were slightly narrow but felt decent enough for short flights. Two-hour layover in Frankfurt was enough to get through security and passport control with time to spare. On arrival in Brussels proceeded straight to baggage claim, where I waited only a couple of minutes for my suitcase so I managed to catch the bus on time. On my way back to Belgrade flown via Munich instead, but the experience was equally good. Would definitely fly with Lufthansa again in the future.",Promoter

Short sector to Frankfurt on A320 was comfortable enough, with nice meal in business class and fabulous and chatty crew. Transfer in Frankfurt was easier than expected and had a 2 hour break in the lounge - which again is big step up from before with nice food on offer. The A380 trip to Beijing was very pleasant. I'm not a fan of the seats arranged in pairs and your feet end very close to your neighbour and seat lacks privacy. Despite those issues, it was comfortable as a flat bed, and the food was again great and tasted fresh for a change. Cabin crew again lovely, smiling and seemed very engaged with passengers. Return trip was fairly similar, excepting long walks and very unpleasant Terminal 3 at Beijing. Would highly recommend.",Promoter

The weak point is that I often experience changes in the flight times (I fly this route several times a year, and about 4 round trips a year on Lufthansa). The airline expects you to be understanding and accommodating, and doesn't give compensation when it causes its passengers inconveniences (like changing the departure time of its flights, or changing the aircraft type at the last hour and your booked and paid premium seat is no longer available). When you ask to be accommodated on another flight (like a later flight after a schedule change), Lufthansa provides a bunch of excuses.

"  Efficient check-in at Heathrow Terminal 2. As I arrived early at the airport Lufthansa moved me to an earlier flight to Frankfurt, and forced me to sit in a middle seat. Crowded and old A320, with soon-disintegrating seats. Service was good, with delicious sandwich and German beer served in glass bottles. Extremely long transit walk at Frankfurt, nearly one hour gate-to-gate, with extremely rude security staff. Chaotic boarding at Frankfurt. One unacceptable thing onboard Lufthansa flights to Hong Kong is that all announcements are made in Mandarin (language in China) instead of Cantonese (main language in Hong Kong), except the safety video which makes the service inconsistent. Mediocre meal but served with wide range of beverages, including post-dinner drinks. The toilet became smelly and dirty only one hour into the 12 hour flight, without improvements during the rest of the flight. Extremely long wait for baggage at Hong Kong, 40 minutes after arriving at the baggage claim for the first priority bag and more than one hour for normal bags.",Passive

The change in Muuich was efficient and reached the connecting gate in plenty of time. Our next leg was delayed by 30 mins (overall), to be fair they did their best to make up time. Nice service onboard - salmon sandwich and a hot drink (cold drinks and wine available too). Friendly crew and really good leg room in row 5.

Well they closed the gate in front of us and we missed the flight. Our next flight to Bydgoszcz was in two days.

"  We took the earliest Lufthansa flight from Lisbon to Frankfurt (LH1173) on the way back from holidays in Portugal. The flight was full and we had the seats at the emergency exit. For this reason, the seat pitch on this specific flight is not representative for all seats but from our inbound flight on the same type of aircraft I as a 189cm person can say, that I had perfectly fitting legroom. We got served a nicely warm breakfast (egg, ham, potatoes) and drinks were served once after the breakfast and additionally the flight attendant served water before landing.

Long line of people queing to board not by row numbers, little delayed in leaving. Sat down the back by the tail, seat 93e. Short of crew on this flight for some reason, could clearly see the results as the service was slow and the crew function like robots, no smile, just doing the motions. Food standard fare nothing special, in-flight entertainment was bad, not much to choose from, not a good selection and the touchscreen was slow to respond. I prefer the Asian carriers as the service and crew are much more efficient and effective but this time I didn't have an alternative. Next time I will try to avoid Lufthansa just another average European carrier.",Detractor
"  New York JFK to Athens via Munich. Great aircraft and great cabin crew to Munich. My first flight ever out of JFK that went to the front of the queue and left early. Seats are very comfortable except when in full sleeper mode. In that position both feet of a reasonably tall person do not fit adequately in the front space, that is a negative. The entertainment system is far superior to the one of the Boeing 747-8. Food served was quite good, the wines were limited but adequate. The cabin staff was outstanding. Last but not least, Munich airport is fabulous.",Promoter
"  Athens to New York via Frankfurt. First flight in the Boeing 747-8 we were on the upper deck. The cabin is very nice and the seats are also very nice, good full-flat foot space as opposed to the A340-600. But, there are no USB jacks or charging - mind-blowing in a new aircraft type. Also, the entertainment system features a screen that has not met pixels and a navigation page that is dismal. Service was efficient if not warm. The food was really lousy for business class. Even a salad was terrible. The contrast with our outbound flight to Munich could not have been sharper. We connected from Athens in Frankfurt and our flight was 55 minutes late. There was no one at the gate or anywhere to direct us or to say if our flight was being held for us. We ran for what seemed like miles until we hit passport control and a line of over 400 very irate travelers. Had it not been for our EU passports we would clearly have missed our flight. Never again through Frankfurt.",Detractor
"  GdaÅ„sk to Cairo via Munich. Both flights was on-time. First leg was operated by small aircraft however there was a lot of space for legs. As a bonus a got free seat next to my seat. Food was standard (two sandwiches to choose) and set of beverages. Second leg was operated in the night by A321, so plane was almost empty (maybe 30% seats occupied). I got full emergency row exit just for me, thanks LH. Meal was hot and tasty. Plane was quite old but they keep it in good condition. On both flights ground and on-board staff was very friendly and helpful. At my final destination was delivered very fast. This trip was really nice and non-problematic. Highly recommend this airline.",Promoter
"  I was flying from Nice to Graz via Munich. I found out that the flight was canceled for whatever reason and the replacement was not possible because it was Sunday. We were told that we would be transported to Graz by bus, which would take more than 5 hrs, and if we had any other questions we should go to the service center counter. I went to the counter, where I was told to wait for an hour until the additional information would be available. When I asked them to re-book my flight, they said that the only option would be to go to Vienna and then to figure out by myself how to get to Graz because most probably the company wouldn't reimburse me the money for the trip from Vienna Airport to Graz. I went back to the gate, got a 10-euro voucher, and was told to come back 45 mins later for the latest updates on my canceled flight. When I came back to the gate, the ground team announced that we were going to be taken to Vienna by a plane provided by a partner company (Austrian) and transported to Graz by bus. This sounded more or less as a solution, but we were then asked to wait until 5pm to get on the plane. I wanted to re-book and to leave to Vienna earlier but found out that the company would only provide one bus at around 6pm and that theoretically I could fly to Vienna earlier and then wait to everyone else. So, I arrived in Graz at 10 pm instead of 1pm which caused a shift in all my plans for the day. I tried to contact the customer relations service by email and never got a response.",Passive
"  Frankfurt to Gdansk in 2016 was delayed 3 times before being cancelled and rescheduled for the afternoon of the next day. I requested LH help desk to find me a solution that would allow me to meet my schedule commitment indicating that I am willing to pay any difference that a solution may require but my request was not given attention. Despite being booked in Business class, I was not put in a five star hotel nor my expenses were met as I required, in addition I was boarded in economy class reaching Gdansk late to my meeting and eventually spending the rest of the day at the hotel and coming back the next day.",Detractor
"  Prague to Los Angeles via Frankfurt. Lufthansa still provides probably the best standards for airlines in Europe, and this trip was comfortable and enjoyable - and good value! The short flight to Frankfurt was on time, small snack, coffee served and staff were very polite. Transfer in Frankfurt was quite easy this time, and had plenty of time for my checked bag to make it through. The long flight to Los Angeles was simply fabulous. Seats are comfortable enough, and similar to most other major airlines. The foods was really good, tasty and quite generous. Best was the cabin attendants who were all really nice. They were cheerful, smiley and spoke good English. Certainly some big changes since I last flew them in 2015. Keep up the good work.",Promoter
"  I booked Lufthansa Business Class because I needed to sleep en-route in a quiet environment. I paid 67,000 Miles & More points for this supposedly restful, relaxing flight and I selected seat 1A on the lower deck of the 747-400 because it is supposedly a secluded area of the cabin. I discovered that two noisy young children were seated together in seats 1H and 1K, with their parents seated behind in 2H and 2K. The parents ignored them and left them to make as much noise as they wanted on the 11Â½ hour flight. They were loud and uncontrolled, and their laughing and shrieking lasted the entire journey, as did their playing with their overhead and angle-poise seat lights in the darkened cabin. It was impossible to sleep with this behaviour going on. Why does Lufthansa allow young children in long-haul Business Class? Why couldn't the children have been seated one per row by the window with a parent to control them? Lufthansa is responsible for whom they allow into their aircraft cabins and for making informed decisions as to whether their behaviour would upset or disturb other premium passengers. On arrival at the Lufthansa lounge at Frankfurt I was told that my flight LH936 to LCY had been cancelled. I went to the reception desk and they had no explanation for the cancelled flight and I had been moved to LH918 flying to LHR. This was annoying because I had arranged a business dinner close to London City Airport which also had to be cancelled.",Detractor
"  Flight from Seattle to Frankfurt, start afternoon in SEA, arrival early morning in FRA, so it was a night flight. Unfortunately, aircraft was a Boeing, thus seats much narrower than in an Airbus. Flight on time and very calm - usual, very good Lufthansa standard. However, cabin staff was not very attentive and sometimes even rude. Beverages were only rarely offered, collection of garbage even more rare. During the night, cabin staff went through the cabin with beverage trays, but did not look carefully if some passengers might be awake and wishing something to drink. About 2 hours before landing, I asked a cabin attendant who passed by with a beverage tray whether she could pick off my garbage, i.e. three empty cups. She said that she is not allowed to put garbage on a tray with food products (which I know) and she had other guests to care for. She would be back later. I asked when as I was aware that they would soon have to start serving breakfast before landing, and she said ""soon"". I did not want to talk too much or too loudly as most other passengers slept, just wanted to know whether the next collection of garbage would happen after the breakfast, whether it would make sense to go to the washroom before without disturbing the distribution of breakfast etc. Had a flight with Air Canada from Frankfurt to Calgary three weeks earlier, and they offered beverages much more often, and they also collected garbage. It was my first time that I experienced rude Lufthansa cabin staff, but other airlines do offer beverages much more frequently during long-distance flights, and they also collect garbage more frequently. Breakfast: only savoury, omelette with roasted bacon and onions. I prefer a sweet breakfast and hoped to get some sort of German breakfast on a flight to Germany with a German airline: some bread, butter, jam, maybe cheese and sausage or even some yoghurt. I am aware that an airline cannot fully respond to all customers' wishes, but a choice between a Northern American breakfast and a continental (German) breakfast would have been highly appreciated. Why not offering two choices as they do with the warm dinner (pasta or chicken)? I still recommend and choose LH for short-distance flights within Europe. First because of Lufthansa's safety standards, second because I can cope with some kind of thirst during short flights.",Passive
  Milan to Frankfurt. There was no group or seat boarding they just board everyone at one time! At the gate when you are waiting to be scanned the lady stopped every person to weigh their luggage and see if it fits into their sample size bin. We took our laptop and camera out of our carryon and the weight works but she said we can bring it because it won't fit into the sample bin and she made us check it in. Ridiculous and this causes boarding longer delay because she stops everyone. At check in they didn't even seat my husband and I together even though the seat next to me is empty.,Detractor
"  Munich to Moscow. A320, no delays. It's amazing even in a simple flight the quality of the service of Lufthansa Business Class. They will treat you by your name, they will smile and they care. The food well, this was part of my meal: Tuna Tanaki (Fresh), fine vegetable salad (also very fresh) Arugula Pesto and Wasabi CrÃ¨me Fraiche after they serve me Prawns in Crustacean Sause, Basmati wild and Camargue rice (what a great rice) with cream Spinach. Sometimes I ask myself why I don't have a Senator Card. The airplane was clean but no WiFi on-board, also no newspapers and Magazines, but with food and service like that who cares about newspapers.Well just a normal Lufthansa Flight",Promoter

"  Stuttgart to Moscow via Frankfurt. On route from my home town Munich to the airport of Stuttgart I realized that I had forgotten my passport at home. Unfortunately it was too late to return. I started to panic as I had to catch a connection in Moscow bound for Hong Kong and all tickets, including the Lufthansa ticket to Moscow, were not allowing any changes - meaning I'd lose all tickets worth approx 2000 Euro if I weren't to get a hold of my passport somehow. I called the LH Senator hotline and they were just wonderful - they really went the extra mile in order to help or offer solutions. They even offered to change my non-changable tickets if it was of any help. Same for the ground staff at STR and FRA airport. Everyone envolved cared and showed the best customer care possible. In the end I had a friend fly from MUC to FRA to deliver my passport. With the help and care of LH my problem was solved and I could travel as planned. The flights were the same high level of quality as all Lufthansa flights.",Promoter
"  I was flying GdaÅ„sk to Singapore via Munich / Frankfurt in Economy. GDN-MUC was operated by very small and thin CRJ-900 with very narrow cabin and standard Lufthansa service on regional flights. Anyway still there is a lot of space for legs. Second flight MUC-FRA took less than 1 hour and again I got some snack and set of drinks. Last flight was operated by double decker A380. Seats was comfortable with enough recline angle. Meals was surprisingly very good (it's not very common on Lufthansa flights). Plane was one of the oldest A380 in Lufthansa fleet, but in-flight entertainment system meets all today requirements, only headsets was very poor quality (plastic), so I was using my own headsets. USB charger in the armrest was working correctly. Unfortunately flight was fully occupied and I got quite big co-passenger so I had limited space (anyway it was not Lufthansa fault). Lounges in all airports was clean and well catered. This time 10 stars.",Promoter
"  Newark to Dresden via Dusseldorf. I would not recommend Lufthansa, staff are not professional and lack customer service. I am a 24-year-old female from New York, and I traveled by myself for the first time for a friend's wedding. It was a terrible and exhausting trip. I missed my connecting flight and had an additional 6 hours of travel by train. Trying to get the train itself was a nightmare. I waited on four different lines in which staff refused to help me, and treated me without courtesy because I could not speak the language. I finally had to get help from a stranger from Dusseldorf who could properly convey what I needed. They lost my luggage, and it was not recovered for four days, a day after the wedding. I had to go to the airport to recover it and was told my lost baggage claim didn't exist and I was blamed for it being mishandled, and when I showed the staff that I had done it properly, they did not apologize to me, they just handed me a feedback card. I filed a feedback form and gotten confirmation that it was received, but it has been three weeks and I haven't heard a word! Everyone makes mistakes, but I feel this airline completely ignores you and doesn't own up to it's mistakes at all.",Detractor

"  Incredibly bad customer service. Flew Detroit to Frankfurt. Travelled with carry on only and it was overweight with 0.8kg. Ground staff lady demanded I checked it because ""we have a full flight today"". I know it's the luggage-rules and Germans are strict. But looking at all the huge trunks being checked in, standing there with my tiny trolley +0.8kg? That had nothing to do with a full flight - just pure rigid rules - so I solved it by wearing my jacket instead of folding it in the trolley. Result was only that the line had gotten severely longer. Why did I even need to be in contact with ground staff? Because I couldn't check-in online in the first place! So much for promoting smooth travelling and being digital.",Detractor

Our outbound flight LH935 to Franfkurt was cancelled which initially had me stressing but as soon as we called a number in the departure lounge, we got rebooked onto the next flight, LH937, it was same seats and no need to go out and reprint boarding card, they did it for us. City Airport take offs are dramatic but the flight whilst bumpy was run with good service, free food and drinks. It was late but this was due to the weather that had our previous flight cancelled, so fine, took off quick. On the inbound flight, Frankfurt airport also had bad weather, my luck. The inbound flight was 40mins late but it then was delayed another hour due to storms again. Same type of service, Flying out of City is expensive but I suppose that's because of convenience over price for business passengers, even though I am a leisure traveller. Would recommend.

"  Flew Lufthansa LH453 from Los Angeles to Munich. Check-in was very quick and smooth, which is very important especially if you're in a rush. Boarding was organized by Economy Class rows, which turned out to be very quick and efficient. The aircraft (an Airbus A340-600) was relatively clean and well maintained, as well as the seats. The seat was exceptional, which included an excellent headrest, a coat-hook, a seat pocket as well as an additional storage compartment for the safety cards and inflight magazines. A comfortable pillow and blanket were provided. The legroom was a solid 31 inches. A footrest was provided which made the seat just a tad more comfortable. The inflight entertainment system was very responsive and offered a decent amount of movies and TV shows to watch on this 11 hour flight. The flight attendants were very attentive and caring. They offered plenty of drinks and snacks, which is important on a long-haul flight in my opinion. The meal was outstanding",Promoter

FRA-DME an old 321 with no IFE, which is for me unacceptable for a 3hour flight. Meal service was chaotic, items constantly running out, but food was quite fine. DME airport a big mess. Long queues on passport control and people were taking baggage from the belt that did not belong to them. LED-FRA was disgusting food, chicken in a very smelly sauce that made whole cabin smell. Seat would not recline. Due to a 10min delay I missed my connection to PRG. No help whatsoever was offered at the airport in order to get from point to point faster. When I complained about this on transfer desk I got an arrogant answer that they can not take everyone by hand to airplane. Lufthansa never again.",Detractor

On all flights, complementary hot and cold beverages and a small complementary sandwich were served. For the sandwich, there was usually a choice between a meat and a vegetarian option.
